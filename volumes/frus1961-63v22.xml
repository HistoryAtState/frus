                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> of the United States series presents
                    the official documentary historical record of major foreign policy decisions and
                    significant diplomatic activity of the United States Government. The series
                    documents the facts and events that contributed to the formulation of policies
                    and includes evidence of supporting and alternative views to the policy
                    positions ultimately adopted.</p>
                <p>The Historian of the Department of State is charged with the responsibility for
                    the preparation of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. The
                    staff of the Office of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, plans,
                    researches, compiles, and edits the volumes in the series. This documentary
                    editing proceeds in full accord with the generally accepted standards of
                    historical scholarship. Official regulations codifying specific standards for
                    the selection and editing of documents for the series were first promulgated by
                    Secretary of State Frank B. Kellogg on March 26, 1925. These regulations, with
                    minor modifications, guided the series through 1991.</p>
                <p>A new statutory charter for the preparation of the series was established by
                    Public Law 102-138, the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> Authorization
                    Act, Fiscal Years 1992 and 1993, which was signed by President George Bush on
                    October 28, 1991. Section 198 of P.L. 102-138 added a new Title IV to the
                    Department of State's Basic Authorities Act of 1956 (22 USC 4351, et seq.).</p>
                <p>The statute requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be
                    a thorough, accurate, and reliable record of major United States foreign policy
                    decisions and significant United States diplomatic activity. The volumes of the
                    series should include all records needed to provide comprehensive documentation
                    of major foreign policy decisions and actions of the United States Government,
                    including facts that contributed to the formulation of policies and records that
                    provided supporting and alternative views to the policy positions ultimately
                    adopted.</p>
                <p>The statute confirms the editing principles established by Secretary Kellogg: the
                        <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series is guided by the principles
                    of historical objectivity and accuracy; records should not be altered or
                    deletions made without indicating in the published text that a deletion has been
                    made; the published record should omit no facts that were of major importance in
                    reaching a decision; and nothing should be omitted for the purposes of
                    concealing a defect in policy. The statute also requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be published not more than 30
                    years after the events recorded.</p>
                <pb n="IV" xml:id="pg_IV" facs="0004"/>
                <p>The editors of this volume, which was compiled in 1992, are convinced that it
                    meets all regulatory, statutory, and scholarly standards of selection and
                    editing with the exception of the compilation on Japan, the reasons for which
                    are explained in the section on Declassification Review. Although this volume
                    records policies and events of more than 30 years ago, the statute of October
                    28, 1991, allows the Department until 1996 to reach the 30-year line in the
                    publication of the series.</p>
                <p>Structure and Scope of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> Series</p>
                <p>This volume is part of a subseries of volumes of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series that documents the most important issues in the
                    foreign policy of the 3 years (1961-1963) of the administration of <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">John F. Kennedy</persName>. The subseries presents in 25
                    print volumes and 5 microfiche supplements a documentary record of major foreign
                    policy decisions and actions of President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>'s administration.</p>
                <p>This volume presents documentation on U.S. policy toward North Asia, including
                    compilations of China, Japan, Korea, and a small compilation on possible
                    recognition of Mongolia. A separate microfiche supplement presents additional
                    documents on China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
                <p>Sources for the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> Series</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> statute requires that the published
                    record in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series include all
                    records needed to provide comprehensive documentation on major foreign policy
                    decisions and actions of the U.S. Government. It further requires that
                    government agencies, departments, and other entities of the U.S. Government
                    cooperate with the Department of State Historian by providing full and complete
                    access to records pertinent to foreign policy decisions and actions and by
                    providing copies of selected records. The editors believe that in terms of
                    access this volume was prepared in accordance with the standards and mandates of
                    this statute.</p>
                <p>The editors had complete access to all the retired records and papers of the
                    Department of State: the central files of the Department; the special
                    decentralized files (“lot files”) of the Department at the bureau, office, and
                    division levels; the files of the Department's Executive Secretariat, which
                    contain the records of international conferences and high-level official visits,
                    correspondence with foreign leaders by the President and Secretary of State, and
                    memoranda of conversations between the President and Secretary of State and
                    foreign officials; and the files of overseas diplomatic posts. Certain
                    intelligence-related files maintained in the Bureau of Intelligence and Research
                    became available to Department historians only after this volume was compiled,
                    but the editors were able to examine them before the volume went for
                    publication. They believe that information in these records was covered
                    adequately in the volume, at least before declassification decisions, and
                    therefore it was unwarranted <pb n="V" xml:id="pg_V" facs="0005"/>to delay
                    publication of the volume. Arrangements have been made for Department historians
                    to have full and timely access to these records for future volumes.</p>
                <p>The editors of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series also have full
                    access to the papers of Presidents <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>, <persName>Johnson</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> and other White House foreign policy
                    records. Presidential papers maintained and preserved at the Presidential
                    libraries include some of the most significant foreign affairs-related
                    documentation from other federal agencies including the National Security
                    Council, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Department of Defense, and the
                    Joint Chiefs of Staff. Also of special value at the Kennedy Library are the
                    papers of <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Roger Hilsman</persName>, Director of the
                    Bureau of Intelligence and Research at the State Department and later Assistant
                    Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs, transcripts of telephone
                    conversations of Under Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">George
                        Ball</persName>, and the Papers of <persName corresp="#p_TJCJ1">James C.
                        Thomson, Jr.,</persName> who served in a series of key staff assistant
                    roles. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Averell Harriman</persName>'s papers at the
                    Manuscript Division of the Library of Congress, which include material from
                        <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>'s tenure as Assistant
                    Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs and then as Under Secretary of State
                    for Political Affairs, constitute another important source.</p>
                <p>Department of State historians also have access to records of the Department of
                    Defense, particularly the records of the Secretary of Defense and his major
                    assistants, and to the <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Maxwell Taylor</persName>
                    Papers and the <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lyman Lemnitzer</persName> Papers at
                    the National Defense University. Those Joint Chiefs of Staff records that were
                    not available in White House, State, or Defense records, were obtained from the
                    Joint Staff of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on a request basis.</p>
                <p>Since 1991, the Central Intelligence Agency has provided expanding access to
                    Department of State historians to high-level intelligence documents from those
                    records in the custody of that Agency. This access is arranged and facilitated
                    by the History Staff of the Center for the Study of Intelligence, Central
                    Intelligence Agency, pursuant to a May 1992 memorandum of understanding. This
                    access arrangement was concluded in connection with the research of volumes for
                    the 1961-1963 triennium and in order to enlarge the scope of coverage as
                    required by the 1991 law. The highly sensitive and security-protected records of
                    the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> do not lend themselves easily to
                    historical research. Department of State and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
                    historians continue to work out the procedural and scholarly aspects of
                    identifying the key portions of the intelligence record. The variety of
                    documentation made available to Department of State historians and ultimately
                    selected for publication in the volumes has expanded. The editors of the volume
                    made particular use of the files of Directors <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen
                        W. Dulles</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">John A.
                        McCone</persName> as well as special collections <pb n="VI" xml:id="pg_VI" facs="0006"/>of records in the custody of the Center for the Study of
                    Intelligence at the Agency.</p>
                <p>All of this documentation has been made available for use in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series thanks to the consent of these
                    agencies, the assistance of their staffs, and especially the cooperation and
                    support of the National Archives and Records Administration. The List of
                    Sources, pages XVII-XXIV, lists the particular files and collections consulted
                    and cited in this volume.</p>
                <p>Principles of Document Selection for the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>
                    Series</p>
                <p>In preparing each volume of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series,
                    the editors are guided by some general principles for the selection of
                    documents. Each editor, in consultation with the General Editor and other senior
                    editors, determines the particular issues and topics to be documented either in
                    detail, in brief, or in summary. Some general decisions are also made regarding
                    issues that cannot be documented in the volume but will be addressed in a
                    microfiche supplement or in bibliographical notes.</p>
                <p>The following general selection criteria are used in preparing volumes in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. Individual compiler-editors
                    vary these criteria in accordance with the particular issues and the available
                    documentation. The editors also tend to apply these selection criteria in
                    accordance with their own interpretation of the generally accepted standards of
                    scholarship. In selecting documentation for publication, the editors give
                    priority to unpublished classified records, rather than previously published
                    records (which are accounted for in appropriate bibliographical notes).</p>
                <p>Selection Criteria (in general order of priority):</p>
                <p>1. Major foreign affairs commitments made on behalf of the United States to other
                    governments, including those that define or identify the principal foreign
                    affairs interests of the United States;</p>
                <p>2. Major foreign affairs issues, commitments, negotiations, and activities,
                    whether or not major decisions were made, and including dissenting or
                    alternative opinions to the process ultimately adopted;</p>
                <p>3. The decisions, discussions, actions, and considerations of the President, as
                    the official constitutionally responsible for the direction of foreign
                    policy;</p>
                <p>4. The discussions and actions of the National Security Council, the Cabinet, and
                    special Presidential policy groups, including the policy options brought before
                    these bodies or their individual members;</p>
                <p>5. The policy options adopted by or considered by the Secretary of State and the
                    most important actions taken to implement Presidential decisions or
                    policies;</p>
                <p>6. Diplomatic negotiations and conferences, official correspondence, and other
                    exchanges between U.S. representatives and those of <pb n="VII" xml:id="pg_VII" facs="0007"/>other governments that demonstrate the main lines of policy
                    implementation on major issues;</p>
                <p>7. Important information that attended Presidential decisions and policy
                    recommendations of the Secretary of State;</p>
                <p>8. Major foreign affairs decisions, negotiations, and commitments undertaken on
                    behalf of the United States by government officials and representatives in other
                    agencies in the foreign affairs community or other branches of government made
                    without the involvement (or even knowledge) of the White House or the Department
                    of State;</p>
                <p>9. The main policy lines of intelligence activities if they constituted major
                    aspects of U.S. foreign policy toward a nation or region or if they provided key

                <p>Scope and Focus of Documents Researched and Selected for <ref target="frus1961-63v22">
                        <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1961-1963, Volume XXII</ref>
                </p>
                <p>The documentation printed in this volume focuses on the formulation of U.S.
                    policy toward North Asia, particularly the most significant aspects of U.S.
                    political, economic, and military relationships with the Governments of Japan,
                    Korea, and the Republic of China on Taiwan. Also included is documentation on
                    U.S. policies toward the People's Republic of China and Mongolia, with which the
                    United States had no official diplomatic relations. President Kennedy in
                    conjunction with key advisers made the major foreign policy decisions during his
                    presidency, and the editors tried to document his role as much possible. The
                    role of White House and National Security Council Staff members in providing
                    information and advice to the President grew during this period. The editors
                    accordingly selected memoranda that presented to the President the views and
                    recommendations of his White House advisers. Formal approved policy papers were
                    rare in the Kennedy administration, and internal discussions between the
                    President and his advisers were not always recorded. <pb n="VIII" xml:id="pg_VIII" facs="0008"/>The editors sought to document Presidential
                    decisions by drawing upon the best material available. The Department of State
                    continued to play a leading role in formulating foreign policy and providing
                    advice on foreign policy matters to the President, and it played the principal
                    role in exchanges of view and negotiations on policy matters with foreign
                    governments. The volume includes documentation on a range of lesser policy
                    decisions that did not reach the President or were resolved in the Department of
                    State or other foreign affairs agencies.</p>
                <p>The microfiche supplement to this volume contains additional documents on the
                    subjects dealt with here. Where appropriate these documents are cited in the
                    volume.</p>
                <p>Editorial Methodology</p>
                <p>The documents are presented chronologically according to Washington time or, in
                    the case of conferences, in the order of individual meetings. Incoming telegrams
                    from U.S. Missions are placed according to time of receipt in the Department of
                    State or other receiving agency, rather than the time of transmission; memoranda
                    of conversation are placed according to the time and date of the conversation,
                    rather than the date the memorandum was drafted.</p>
                <p>Editorial treatment of the documents published in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series follows Office style guidelines, supplemented by
                    guidance from the General Editor and the chief technical editor. The source text
                    is reproduced as exactly as possible, including marginalia or other notations,
                    which are described in the footnotes. Texts are transcribed and printed
                    according to accepted conventions for the publication of historical documents in
                    the limitations of modern typography. A heading has been supplied by the editors
                    for each document included in the volume. Spelling, capitalization, and
                    punctuation are retained as found in the source text, except that obvious
                    typographical errors are silently corrected. Other mistakes and omissions in the
                    source text are corrected by bracketed insertions: a correction is set in italic
                    type; an addition in roman type. Words or phrases underlined in the source text
                    are printed in italics. Abbreviations and contractions are preserved as found in
                    the source text, and a list of abbreviations is included in the front matter of
                    each volume.</p>
                <p>Bracketed insertions are also used to indicate omitted text that deals with an
                    unrelated subject (in roman type) or that remains classified after
                    declassification review (in italic type). The amount of material not
                    declassified has been noted by indicating the number of lines or pages of source
                    text that were omitted. Entire documents withheld for declassification purposes
                    have been accounted for and are listed by headings, source note information, and
                    number of pages not declassified in their chronological place. The amount of
                    material omitted from this volume because it was unrelated to the subject of the
                    volume, however, has not <pb n="IX" xml:id="pg_IX" facs="0009"/>been delineated.
                    Brackets that appear in the source text are so identified by footnotes.</p>
                <p>An unnumbered source note to each document indicates the document's source,
                    original classification, distribution, and drafting information. This note also
                    provides the background of important documents and policies and indicates if the
                    President or his major policy advisers read the document. Every effort has been
                    made to determine if a document has been previously published, and this
                    information has been included in the source footnote.</p>
                <p>Editorial notes and additional annotation summarize pertinent material not
                    printed in the volume, indicate the location of additional documentary sources,
                    provide references to important related documents printed in other volumes,
                    describe key events, and provide summaries of and citations to public statements
                    that supplement and elucidate the printed documents. Information derived from
                    memoirs and other first-hand accounts have been used when appropriate to
                    supplement or explicate the official record.</p>
                <p>Advisory Committee on Historical Diplomatic Documentation</p>
                <p>The Advisory Committee on Historical Diplomatic Documentation, established under
                    the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> statute, reviews records, advises,
                    and makes recommendations concerning the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series. The Advisory Committee monitors the overall
                    compilation and editorial process of the series and advises on all aspects of
                    the preparation and declassification of the series. Although the Advisory
                    Committee does not attempt to review the contents of individual volumes in the
                    series, it does monitor the overall process and makes recommendations on
                    particular problems that come to its attention.</p>
                <p>Declassification Review</p>
                <p>The final declassification review of this volume was completed in 1995. The
                    compilation on China had no documents denied in full and excisions amount to 1.1
                    percent of the documentation originally selected for publication. The editors
                    believe it is a thorough, accurate and reliable record of major United States
                    foreign policy decisions and significant diplomatic activity.</p>
                <p>In the compilation on Japan, 13.5 percent of the material selected for
                    publication was not declassified. The Office of the Historian prepared a
                    compilation for Japan of 65 documents, 3 for the 1958-1960 period and 62 for
                    1961-1963. Nine documents were denied declassification, despite full use of the
                    appeal process for 3 of them. The denied material relates to ramifications and
                    arrangements arising from certain aspects of the Mutual Security Treaty of 1960
                    and concern and actions of the U.S. Government in response to the political
                    situation in Japan during the years 1958-1960. The Advisory Committee on
                    Historical Diplomatic Documentation <pb n="X" xml:id="pg_X" facs="0010"/>has
                    examined the denied documents and concluded that this published compilation does
                    not constitute a “thorough, accurate, and reliable documentary record of major
                    United States foreign policy decisions,” the standard set by Public Law 102-138
                    of October 28, 1991 (22 USC 4351, et seq.). The Advisory Committee will continue
                    to seek declassification of the documents withheld.</p>
                <p>In the compilation on Korea, 5.9 percent of the documentation originally selected
                    was withheld; four documents were denied in full. All four originated in the
                    Department of Defense and concerned a high-level debate about potential
                    alternative methods of defending the Republic of Korea against the threat from
                    China and North Korea. While it was an interesting deliberation, the debate did
                    not eventuate in any policy recommendation and never moved beyond the
                    theoretical stage. Therefore, the editors believe that the compilation on Korea
                    is an accurate and reliable record of U.S. policy decisions toward Korea as well
                    as of significant diplomatic activity with the Republic of Korea.</p>
                <p>The Division of Historical Documents Review of the Office of Freedom of
                    Information, Privacy, and Classification Review, Bureau of Administration,
                    Department of State, conducted the declassification review of the documents
                    published in this volume. The review was conducted in accordance with the
                    standards set forth in Executive Order 12356 on National Security Information,
                    which was superseded by Executive Order 12958 on April 20, 1995, and applicable
                    laws.</p>
                <p>Under Executive Order 12356, information that concerns one or more of the
                    following categories, and the disclosure of which reasonably could be expected
                    to cause damage to the national security, requires classification:</p>
                <p>1) military plans, weapons, or operations;</p>
                <p>2) the vulnerabilities or capabilities of systems, installations, projects, or
                    plans relating to the national security;</p>
                <p>3) foreign government information;</p>
                <p>4) intelligence activities (including special activities), or intelligence
                    sources or methods;</p>
                <p>5) foreign relations or foreign activities of the United States;</p>
                <p>6) scientific, technological, or economic matters relating to national
                    security;</p>
                <p>7) U.S. Government programs for safeguarding nuclear materials or facilities;</p>
                <p>8) cryptology; or</p>
                <p>9) a confidential source.</p>
                <p>The principle guiding declassification review is to release all information,
                    subject only to the current requirements of national security and law.
                    Declassification decisions entailed concurrence of the appropriate geographic
                    and functional bureaus in the Department of State, other <pb n="XI" xml:id="pg_XI" facs="0011"/>concerned agencies of the U.S. Government, and
                    the appropriate foreign governments regarding specific documents of those
                    governments.</p>

                        <p>Dear Mr. President:</p>
                        <p>I have read with profound appreciation the kind sentiments which you have
                            expressed in your letter of December 14<note n="2" xml:id="d1fn2">For

                            States assistance to the Republic of China during the past eight years.
                            The close and fruitful relations that have existed between our two
                            countries during this period have been a source of great gratification
                            to me. As I made clear during my visit to Taiwan last June, I have been
                            deeply impressed by the fortitude with which the Republic of China,
                            under your dedicated leadership, has resisted Communist aggressive
                            threats and pressures and by the energy and skill with which your
                            government has moved to promote the economic and social development of
                            Taiwan. I am proud that the United States through its military and
                            economic assistance programs has been able to help the Republic of China
                            develop its military and economic strength.</p>
                        <p>I am pleased to know that discussions between representatives of our two
                            countries have continued in Taiwan in pursuance of our conversations in
                            June and my reply to certain points raised by you at that time which was
                            conveyed to you by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DEF1">Drumright</persName> in August. In this connection I am glad to
                            tell you that, after careful consideration of your request for the
                            delivery of several C-130 or other transport planes, I have authorized
                            the delivery to your Government of one C-130B at this <pb n="2" xml:id="pg_2" facs="0038"/>time.<note n="3" xml:id="d1fn3">The

                            am sure, that in view of the large number of countries which look to the
                            United States for military equipment, as well as the requirements of our
                            own armed forces, it is difficult to make immediately available to your
                            Government more than one of these aircraft. However, if in the light of
                            your experience with this aircraft it should become apparent that
                            another of the same type could be effectively utilized, I am confident
                            that the United States Government would give serious consideration to a
                            further request from you.</p>

                        <p>At the 475th meeting of the National Security Council on February 1,
                            1961, there was some discussion pertaining to China. According to <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Action No. 2397A, Director of Central
                            Intelligence <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen W. Dulles</persName>
                            noted the “serious agricultural situation in Communist China” in the
                            course of briefing the Council on world developments. Subsequently,
                            there was brief discussion of a possible change in U.S. policy to permit
                            U.S. oil companies to provide bunkering to foreign ships carrying food
                            to the People's Republic of China under Chinese charter. <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Action No. 2397C records this as

                            requested that the Secretary of State study this question further,
                            particularly whether any such change in policy could be at the request

                                <persName corresp="#p_DFG1">Frederick G. Dutton</persName> to

                            Secretary of the Treasury <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">C. Douglas
                                Dillon</persName> was requesting the President's approval of a
                            “State-Treasury decision to authorize U.S. oil companies to bunker ships
                            with Chinese Communist charter carrying food from Australia, Canada and
                            elsewhere to the Chinese mainland because of the famine.” He recommended
                            that the request should be informally denied. The memorandum reads in
                            part as follows: “Although a decision either way on this is not
                            critical, I conclude that the action proposed by State and Treasury (a)
                            raises unnecessary possibilities of domestic political attack for the
                            new Administration (without adequate countervailing advantages in a
                            substantive sense), and (b) most decisive with me, would be a poor
                            symbolic or actual first step toward a new policy vis-à-vis Red China.
                            Certainly a better ‘First small gesture’… an important consideration in
                            a change of major controversial policy … could be picked than this one
                            to presage new attitudes toward trade with Red China markets.”

                        <p>The Chinese Ambassador called this afternoon at the Secretary's request.
                            After an exchange of amenities, the Ambassador said that for the sake of
                            convenience and clarity, he had put what he wanted to say in writing; he
                            then handed the attached informal memorandum<note n="1" xml:id="d3fn1">The memorandum, headed “Remarks made by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YGKC1">George C. Yeh</persName> to the Secretary of

                            it was neither a demarche nor a note.</p>
                        <p>After reading the memorandum, the Secretary said that he would like to
                            make two points. The first was that the new Administration fully intends
                            to meet United States commitments under the Mutual Defense Treaty<note n="2" xml:id="d3fn2">For text of the Mutual Defense Treaty between

                            under it. Secondly, it will take an interest in efforts to promote
                            economic and social development in Taiwan and hopes to play a
                            substantial part in them.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary went on to say with reference to the question of
                            recognition of Communist China (which had been raised in the
                            Ambassador's memorandum) that he could not see any prospect that this
                            question would arise in any form which would make such a development
                            possible. <pb n="5" xml:id="pg_5" facs="0041"/>There was no indication
                            from Peiping that the Chinese Communists were interested in bringing
                            this about, and we ourselves had no intention of taking any initiative.
                            As the Ambassador knew, Peiping says that the United States has to
                            abandon his Government. We, of course, will not do that.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the problem of Chinese representation in the United
                            Nations, the Secretary recalled that he had indicated in the hearings
                            before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that we faced a very
                            complicated parliamentary situation in the United Nations.<note n="3" xml:id="d3fn3">

                            clear, however, that support was running out for the moratorium, not
                            only because of the admission of a great many new States, but for other
                            reasons as well. For example, some of our Latin American friends were
                            worried about the failure of the United Nations to recognize a de facto
                            regime on the Chinese mainland since in Latin America there was
                            sometimes a succession of de facto regimes. The parliamentary situation
                            in the United Nations was complicated by the fact that with respect to
                            the new states neither the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> nor the
                            United States has a great deal of political capital or influence on this
                            issue. If the Chinese representation this year came up as a simple
                            credentials question, our position would be technically weak, since the
                            issue could be decided by a bare majority. The Secretary said that the
                            Administration was assuming that the Chinese representation issue had
                            been dealt with for the resumed General Assembly<note n="4" xml:id="d3fn4">The General Assembly decided in Resolution 1493 (XV),

                                proposals on the question of Chinese representation; the resolution

                            the present voting situation thoroughly in view of other pressing
                            matters. He asked whether Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YGKC1">Yeh</persName> had heard anything from Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TT1">Tsiang</persName> on the current voting
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YGKC1">Yeh</persName> replied that he
                            had been in touch with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TT1">Tsiang</persName> on this subject. It was their conclusion that the
                            moratorium should not be given up lightly without further research into
                            the possibilities of maintaining it through the next (16th) General
                            Assembly. After pointing out that the Chinese had lost only one and one
                            half votes on the moratorium in the 15th General Assembly, Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_YGKC1">Yeh</persName> acknowledged that the
                            behavior of the African states was disturbing. Although assurances had
                            been received from eleven African states in writing that they would
                            support the moratorium in the 15th General Assembly, after their
                            delegations had come to New York, and had been worked on by the Indians
                            and by other Africans such as Sekou Toure, they had decided to abstain.
                            They had sent a verbal note to the Chinese indicating that in their <pb n="6" xml:id="pg_6" facs="0042"/>own interests, after talking with
                            other countries, they had decided not to take sides on this cold war
                            issue. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YGKC1">Yeh</persName>
                            emphasized, however, that his Government was working on the African
                            countries. It had established diplomatic relations with eleven of them.
                            There were a few Chinese Ambassadors roving about Africa with
                            credentials in their pockets ready to establish relations in order to
                            prevent the Chinese Communists from getting in. Moreover, a <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> agricultural mission was presently
                            touring Africa. The Ambassador hoped that as a result of these Chinese
                            efforts, the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would be able to get
                            the support of Liberia and four or five of the former French colonies
                            for the moratorium. He thought there would be twenty or twenty-five
                            abstentions. Thus, it might still be possible to make a moratorium work
                            in the next General Assembly.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary commented that the outcome might be influenced by events
                            between now and next General Assembly, e.g., by developments in Laos or
                            by pressures from the north into Southeast Asia. The Ambassador
                            agreed.</p>
                        <p>Taking the Secretary's mention of Laos as his cue the Ambassador
                            expressed the hope that the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> would
                            not be revived as this might bring Souvanna Phouma<note n="5" xml:id="d3fn5">Former Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma.</note> back.
                            The Ambassador emphasized the strategic importance of Laos, with
                            particular reference to the security of Viet-Nam and Thailand. The
                            Secretary agreed that it was important to prevent Laos from falling
                            under Communist domination. The Ambassador said that while he
                            appreciated the United States desire to obtain a broad base for its
                            policy in Laos, he would like to point out that the free Asian countries
                            no longer look to the French or the British, but to the United States
                            for leadership. He felt that the French, who harbored some resentment
                            against United States influence in Laos, do not care about keeping the
                            Communists out of Laos. The British want peace in Laos regardless of the
                            political trends, and believe that the Lao cannot be taught
                            anti-Communism. The Secretary said that any shift outwards from Laos of
                            our point of contact with the Communists would of course be
                            disadvantageous. The Ambassador, in passing, commented that in Thailand
                                Sarit<note n="6" xml:id="d3fn6">Thai Prime Minister Thanarat
                                Sarit.</note> was anti-Communist, but that Pote Sarasin,<note n="7" xml:id="d3fn7">Secretary General of the Southeast Asia Treaty
                                Organization Pote Sarasin.</note> because of his position in SEATO,
                            had to maintain good relations with the British and French, while the
                            Thai Foreign Minister did not want to stick his neck out.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he thought it was most unfortunate that the
                            Chinese irregulars had come into northwest Laos from Burma. He stressed
                            that anything which gave the Chinese Communists a pretext to intervene
                            in Laos was not only a great disservice to Laos, but also to the
                            mobilization of opinion in support of resistance to the Communists <pb n="7" xml:id="pg_7" facs="0043"/>there. He asked Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_YGKC1">Yeh</persName> to tell his Government
                            not to play that role. The Ambassador said he would report the
                            Secretary's concern to his Government. He recalled that his Government
                            had helped evacuate many of the irregulars several years ago.<note n="8" xml:id="d3fn8">Several thousand Chinese Nationalist irregular troops
                                were evacuated in 1953-1954; for related documentation, see <ref target="frus1952-54v12p2">

                                    XII</ref>, Part 2, pp. 1-242 ff.</note> The Secretary replied
                            that he was aware of this and he also was aware that the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> had agreed not to have any further
                            connections with the irregulars, but unfortunately it was still
                            supplying them by air-drop. The Ambassador said that he was aware that
                            the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> had air-dropped medicines and
                            doctors to the irregulars last fall, but he was not aware of any supply
                            of arms and ammunition. He would personally be very unhappy if he felt
                            that such supplies were going in. However, he was certain that his
                            Government was not pursuing a policy of sustaining and strengthening the
                            irregulars, who were not good fighters. The Secretary said that the
                            irregulars were not under discipline and were not an effective fighting
                            force. They simply opened up, by their presence in the area,
                            possibilities of counter-pressures from the Communists. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_YGKC1">Yeh</persName> said the irregulars had
                            been under pressure since December between the Chinese Communists and
                            the Burmese. In connection with the demarcation of the Sino-Burma border
                            the Burmese had given the Chinese Communists the right of hot pursuit
                            against the irregulars. Elements of two Chinese Communist divisions had
                            been identified in Burma.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked if the irregulars were not remnants of the Chinese
                            Army. The Ambassador said they were not, but were originally in Lung
                                <persName corresp="#p_YP1">Yun</persName>'s<note n="9" xml:id="d3fn9">Lung <persName corresp="#p_YP1">Yun</persName> was a

                            fled across the border into Burma when the Chinese Communists occupied
                            Yunnan. Their commander, Li Mi, was not with them at the time. He
                            subsequently went to Bangkok without the permission of the Chinese
                            Government and had led these forces back into Yunnan, where they
                            occupied 16 hsien. They were subsequently driven back into Burma by the
                            Communists and were accompanied by some 75,000 men, women and children
                            from Yunnan. The Secretary asked the Ambassador to impress upon his
                            Government the importance of cleaning up the irregulars situation.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador drew the attention of the Secretary to the last paragraph
                            of his memorandum<note n="10" xml:id="d3fn10">The last paragraph
                                expressed the hope that <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>
                                would make a statement in the near future that U.S. policy in regard
                                to “the China question” remained unchanged and that the United
                                States would continue to support the position of the Republic of
                                China internationally and in the United Nations. On February 6 in
                                response to a question at a press conference about the Chinese
                                representation issue, <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>
                                stated, “The essence of the problem is that we have strong
                                commitments to our ally, the Government and people of Formosa: the
                                National Government of China. That commitment is firm, and, of
                                course, the other side looks upon that as a major obstacle.”</note>
                            and asked whether the Secretary might be <pb n="8" xml:id="pg_8" facs="0044"/>able to make a statement on China policy in the near
                            future. The Secretary said he thought that he had done that in the
                            Senate hearings. He had expressed his support there for the Mutual
                            Defense Treaty. He would, however, give further thought to the
                            matter.</p>

                            level as the meetings of the Military Staff Committee at the United
                            Nations. The Ambassador said that he hoped that the Department could
                            continue to keep the Chinese Embassy informed of what might transpire at
                            the Warsaw talks.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that he had the duty to convey a true picture of what
                            was going on both to Taipei and to Washington, and he hoped the
                            Secretary would have confidence in him so that he could perform this
                            duty intelligently. He said that Taipei has been under some
                            misapprehensions and he hoped that the Secretary would take an early
                            occasion to repeat the statements he made in the Senate hearings. The
                            Secretary said that the problem the Chinese Government faced in the
                            United Nations was not with the United States. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TT1">Tsiang</persName> would have to continue to work
                            hard on this problem. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YGKC1">Yeh</persName> mentioned that the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> had a problem in connection with ECOSOC. The Secretary
                            replied that he was not familiar with this particular problem, but in
                            general he thought that the question of Chinese representation, which
                            was a highly political issue, should be resolved in the General Assembly
                            and the Security Council, and not in the subsidiary bodies of the United
                            Nations.</p>

                            the recent course of the ambassadorial-level talks in Warsaw between the
                            United States and the Chinese Communists, together with suggestions for
                            possible ways in which we might proceed in forthcoming meetings. The

                            developments which have occurred since bilateral talks began in June
                            1954) and the suggestions on possible approaches in forthcoming meetings
                            are transmitted herewith (Tabs A and B, respectively).<note n="2" xml:id="d4fn2">Neither printed. Tab A was a summary of bilateral
                                talks. Tab B discussed possible approaches for the talks. In case a
                                decision was made to introduce new subjects for discussion, it
                                suggested probing the Chinese position on disarmament and nuclear
                                control, sounding out the Chinese reaction to a possible U.S. offer
                                of food assistance, and introducing the topic of an interchange of
                                scholars. It also suggested reintroducing the issue of a possible
                                exchange of newsmen, noted that progress on the issue of
                                renunciation of force was unlikely, and recommended raising the
                                issue of the five U.S. civilians imprisoned in China and U.S.
                                military personnel missing since the Korean conflict as a matter of
                                record although it was not expected that discussion would be
                                fruitful.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>In my opinion the over-all review of the record demonstrates that Peiping
                            has not regarded the ambassadorial-level meetings primarily as a channel
                            in which to adjust differences with us through genuine negotiations, but
                            rather as a vehicle for demanding major political concessions from
                            us—first, the withdrawal of United States forces from the Taiwan area,
                            and to a lesser extent, the granting of some form of de facto United
                            States diplomatic recognition to the Peiping regime—as the price for any
                            concessions on its part. Our own immediate objectives have been much
                            less: namely, securing the release of American prisoners and an
                            agreement renouncing the use of force. When it became evident to the
                            Peiping regime in the latter part of 1955 that we were not prepared to
                            pay its price, Communist China simply ceased to honor the sole agreement
                            reached in the talks (a commitment by each side to release
                            “expeditiously” all <pb n="10" xml:id="pg_10" facs="0046"/>detained
                            personnel of the other side) and became increasingly intransigent in its
                            insistence that no improvement in its relations with the United States
                            could be effected except on its terms. In particular, I call your
                            attention to Peiping's statement of September 13, 1960<note n="3" xml:id="d4fn3">For text, see <hi rend="italic">Peking Review</hi>,
                                September 14, 1960.</note> that it will no longer discuss “minor
                            matters,” but will devote itself to such “fundamental issues” as
                            securing United States consent to “withdraw all its armed forces from
                            China's territory Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait area.”</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, it is my belief that despite the rigid and hostile stance
                            of the Chinese Communists, we have derived the following distinct
                            political and psychological gains from the talks:</p>
                        <p>1. We have been able to cite to United States and world public opinion
                            that we are not “ignoring 650 million people,” as has frequently been
                            charged, but have actually been dealing with the Chinese Communists on a
                            regular basis on matters of common concern. (Unfortunately, the
                            effectiveness of this argument has been watered down by the obvious
                            sterility of our exchanges with the Chinese Communists over the last two
                            years.)</p>
                        <p>2. As a result of long and patient negotiations with the Chinese
                            Communists on various issues, we have been able to an appreciable extent
                            to place the onus for the tense relations between the United States and
                            Communist China where it belongs, on the Chinese Communists themselves.
                            For example, the talks have aided greatly in publicizing the Peiping
                            regime's detention of five American prisoners in contravention of its
                            commitment to release all such persons. The record has also helped
                            emphasize the fact that Peiping in effect demands the surrender of
                            Taiwan in return for any improvement in Sino-American relations, and has
                            made it plain to interested parties, especially journalists, that the
                            Chinese Communists are adamantly opposed to the admission of American
                            newsmen to the China mainland under conditions which would permit
                            objective reporting on conditions there.</p>
                        <p>3. The talks have apparently acted as a partial damper on Chinese
                            Communist military actions against Taiwan, i.e., since August 1955
                            Peiping has resorted to force in the Taiwan Strait area only during a
                            period when the talks were not in session, and the subject of
                            renunciation of force was not being actively pursued by us. After having
                            failed to gain Kinmen (Quemoy) through its attacks of August-September
                            1958, Peiping then took the initiative in proposing that the meetings be
                            resumed.</p>
                        <p>4. The continuation of the talks minimizes the chance of third parties'
                            attempting to set themselves up as middlemen between Peiping and
                            ourselves, thereby further complicating our relations with the
                            regime.</p>
                        <p>5. The talks constitute a direct, private means of communications between
                            the United States and Communist China which we have been able to use to
                            bring up a wide array of topics, even after the Chinese Communists <pb n="11" xml:id="pg_11" facs="0047"/>released the statement mentioned
                            above refusing to discuss “minor matters.” (In my judgment, for all
                            practical purposes we can disregard Peiping's statement, and my view is
                            shared by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BJD1">Beam</persName> in
                            Warsaw.)</p>
                        <p>This last feature of the talks is one which could be of considerable
                            significance to United States policy interests. Should the Chinese
                            Communists ever moderate their hostility toward the United States and
                            sincerely seek to adjust the differences between us, the private nature
                            of the talks might well facilitate progress by obviating any loss of
                            “face” to the regime through such a reversal. By like token, if we
                            ourselves should desire to sound out the Chinese Communist attitude and
                            intentions regarding major world issues (including disarmament and
                            nuclear control), or expand our efforts to find reasonable grounds for
                            an understanding with the Peiping regime, the ambassadorial-level
                            contact provides us with a convenient, rapid, and entirely confidential
                            channel to the leaders of that regime. In my mind these factors alone
                            amply justify continuation of the talks quite apart from the other
                            advantages I have cited. Conversely, cessation of the talks would
                            probably be interpreted by world opinion and by the Chinese Communists
                            themselves as a negative gesture betokening a United States
                            unwillingness to seek settlement of its disputes with Peiping by
                            peaceful negotiations. In the psychological as well as practical sense,
                            we are certainly in a better position vis-a-vis the Chinese Communists
                            with the talks still continuing than we would otherwise be.</p>
                        <p>Admittedly little of a substantive nature has been gained in the most
                            recent phase of the talks, but I do not feel that we should assess the
                            value of the meetings solely in terms of what tangible results are
                            gained. Moreover, it is conceivable that your assumption of office may
                            provide the Chinese Communists with a justification for responding more
                            positively to our overtures, whether on matters already under discussion
                            or on entirely new subjects. It is in this light that I have appended
                            the list of suggested topics and approaches for use in forthcoming
                            meetings (Tab B) for your comment or approval. The next meeting is now
                            scheduled for March 7, and I would greatly appreciate having your views
                            on the conduct of the talks far enough in advance so that draft
                            instructions can be prepared and cleared with the Departmental offices
                                concerned.<note n="4" xml:id="d4fn4">A February 21 memorandum from

                            upon immediate discussion of the so-called “fundamental issues.” It
                            seems that the conversations provide certain minor advantages to us at
                            the present time and might be even more useful in the future. However, I
                            think it is obvious that we are not prepared at this moment to discuss
                            with the Chinese Communists such matters as the status of Taiwan,
                            disarmament and nuclear controls, etc.”</p>

                            Further, all irregulars unwilling return Formosa should be disarmed and
                            resettled as civilians to small groups in any neighboring country other
                            than Laos willing to receive them. Maintenance and identity as a large
                            organized group must cease.</p>
                        <p>2. <gloss target="#t_USG1">USGov</gloss> would consider it a major
                            infraction of expressed and implicit obligations of <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> to <gloss target="#t_USG1">USGov</gloss> if supplies of US origin are henceforth furnished
                                <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> irregulars by US type
                            aircraft.</p>
                        <p>3. Recent activities <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> regarding these
                            irregulars, contrary to earlier understanding that <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would accept no further responsibility
                            for personnel not evacuated in 1953-54, plus failure <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> to inform <gloss target="#t_USG1">USGov</gloss> of such activities imposes a severe strain on
                            hitherto friendly relations between our two countries.</p>
                        <p>4. We find it incomprehensible that <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            should recklessly create situation which imposes upon itself formidable
                            international political burdens at time when it can least afford them.
                            Further such action severely <pb n="13" xml:id="pg_13" facs="0049"/>limits any effective political help which <gloss target="#t_USG1">USGov</gloss> might be able render to <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> in its difficult situation.</p>
                        <p>5. <gloss target="#t_USG1">USGov</gloss> will not bargain with respect to
                            reabsorption <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> personnel in Formosa
                            but would be willing to ask assistance other necessary governments
                            regarding arrangements to liquidate problem.</p>
                        <p>6. <gloss target="#t_USG1">USGov</gloss> must enter reservations to
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>'s denial that arms equipment or
                            supplies furnished to <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> for other
                            purposes were improperly used pending results further investigation.</p>
                        <p>7. <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> must be aware that other nations
                            will hold US directly responsible for <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> actions in this situation in view of close military and
                            other relationships between our two countries. <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> must understand that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USGov</gloss> is determined to protect its reputation and good
                            faith and will, if necessary, do so at cost of <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>. <gloss target="#t_USG1">USGov</gloss> is considering
                            steps it might take to reduce cooperation with <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> in order make clear its complete disassociation from
                            these activities but believes that most effective solution would be
                            steps taken publicly and vigorously by <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> to liquidate situation. This would be better solution
                            for both.</p>
                        <p>8. <gloss target="#t_USG1">USGov</gloss> hopes that this serious threat
                            to otherwise good relations will not be permitted to continue; we would
                            find it difficult to believe that <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            would underestimate gravity of problem and fail to act with greatest
                            vigor.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>. Greatly appreciate your previous
                            strenuous efforts this matter. If position outlined above sounds severe,

                        <p>Referring to his conversation in Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s office,<note n="1" xml:id="d6fn1">According to a
                                memorandum of this conversation, Menzies suggested that they
                                consider some sort of package proposal, which might include a seat
                                for the Chinese Communists in the General Assembly and in the
                                Security Council, with a separate independent existence and seat in
                                the General Assembly for the Chinese Nationalists. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> stated that it would be
                                “disastrous” for the United States and the United Nations to treat
                                the China issue as a credentials question. (Ibid.,
                                793.00/2-2461)</note> the Prime Minister went over much of the same
                            ground. He expressed his concern that the moratorium was no longer a
                            useful device for dealing with the question of Chinese representation in
                            the United Nations. Speaking in anticipation of his visit to the United
                            Kingdom for the Commonwealth Conference, he mentioned that down the line
                            in the Foreign Office he felt there was disregard of the Chinese
                            Nationalists and that this colored British attitudes. The Secretary and
                            the President both referred to recent public statements, notably by
                                <persName corresp="#p_HLAFD1">Lord Home</persName>, and it was
                            intimated that it would be helpful if the British refrained as much as
                            possible from public expressions prior to consultation with us. There
                            had not been opportunity for such discussions yet.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister Menzies made it clear that in his view Formosa should not
                            be abandoned. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> again
                            mentioned that the issue should be dealt with, not as a matter of
                            credentials, but of membership. Mr. Menzies reiterated that regardless
                            of our views on the substance of the problem, it was even more important
                            that the United States not suffer defeat and isolation on this
                            matter.</p>
                        <p>The President several times mentioned the deep feeling which the Chinese
                            issue engendered here, saying that it extended broadly throughout both
                            parties. It should not be dealt with in such a way as to cause <pb n="15" xml:id="pg_15" facs="0051"/>harmful divisions and controversy
                            here. He alluded to former President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>'s strong feeling and continued interest in
                            this subject. The President also said that were Communist China to be
                            seated in the United Nations, American support for the United Nations
                            might very well be forfeit. These points, effect on the United States
                            and effect on the United Nations, which we desired to support, were
                            basic in the President's thinking on this subject. Were it not necessary
                            for these reasons strongly to oppose the Chinese Communists, who
                            maintained an attitude of hostility to the new administration, the
                            admission of Red China would be relatively a matter of indifference. No
                            one was doing very well with the Communist Chinese in their present
                            isolation. However, so far as our own bilateral situation was concerned,
                            there was no intention to recognize Communist China, which, for its
                            part, was in no mood to deal with us except on its terms.</p>
                        <p>There was discussion of the Chinese irregulars in Burma, a problem which
                            was viewed in the context of <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang
                                Kai-shek</persName>'s preoccupation with a return to the mainland.
                            None of those present thought that he was likely to give up this
                            mystical aim. Also discussed was the question of the effect on the
                            Chinese minorities in southeast Asian countries if Communist China were
                            to gain admission to the United Nations. Mr. Menzies thought this effect
                            would be less, and perhaps manageable, if the Republic of China on
                            Formosa were maintained as a country in being with support from our
                            side. The President expressed interest in learning on what other
                            occasions the Chinese Communists had expressed themselves, as <persName corresp="#p_CEZE1">Chou En-lai</persName> had to Edgar Snow, against
                            the two Chinas thesis. He was told that this was a longstanding and
                            constantly reiterated position.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister Menzies pointed out that the China issue was not just a
                            question between the two blocs — it was a conflict between two sets of
                            ideas that were fundamentally different. In this context it involved
                            everyone — not just the major powers. He reiterated that, right or
                            wrong, in Australian opinion, Australia would support the United States
                            position, as it did not wish to see the United States defeated or
                            isolated on this. In the context of further statement by the President
                            of our determination not to permit abandonment of the Republic of China
                            and to take a strong position against the admission of Communist China
                            to the United Nations, Mr. Menzies asked if he could quote the Secretary
                            to the British to this effect. He thought perhaps the President should
                            be left “above these storms.” The President nodded agreement to Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s suggestion that it
                            would be useful for Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> to know privately that these were the
                            President's views as well as his own. Mr. Menzies said it would be most
                            useful for him to be able to speak in this vein in London.</p>

                            had heretofore been as close and harmonious as possible. Nothing should
                            be done, he said, by one country to cause harm to the other or to make
                            difficulties. If any difficulty arose it was up to two governments to
                            make adjustments and for each to help the other.</p>
                        <p>President then said that when I had made previous representations
                            (February 7),<note n="3" xml:id="d7fn3">Reported in telegrams 459 and
                                461 from Taipei, February 7 and 8. (Ibid., 751J.00/2-761 and
                                751J.00/2-861)</note> irregulars were in midst of engagements with
                            Burmese and ChiCom forces. He believed at time no harm was being done to
                            US interests. Moreover, attempts at that time to evacuate irregulars
                            would have affected fighting spirit and morale of forces. In view of
                            these factors, President said he felt at time he could do or say nothing
                            regarding evacuation. President added hatred of irregulars for ChiComs
                            was such, his attempts at that time to persuade irregulars to withdraw
                            would have been to no avail. What was true of irregulars was true of all
                            patriotic Chinese civilian and military alike—a common hatred of and
                            enmity for ChiComs.</p>
                        <p>President continued as follows: But after irregulars withdrew from Mong
                            Pa Liao and more particularly after plane incident in northern Thailand
                            on February 15,<note n="4" xml:id="d7fn4">A Chinese Nationalist plane

                            realized situation was actually causing inconvenience and embarrassment
                            to US. <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> had therefore ceased airdrops
                            thereafter. He had felt bad after Burmese and ChiComs <pb n="17" xml:id="pg_17" facs="0053"/>had seized opportunity to embarrass US.
                            He was especially sorry about demonstrations before US Embassy in
                            Rangoon.</p>
                        <p>President then said <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> is prepared to
                            evacuate “those elements responsive to our influence” to Taiwan since
                            their presence where they now are is of no benefit to <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> and a cause of embarrassment to US. But
                            there was one matter of which US Government should be aware: There are
                            irregulars not responsive to <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> orders.
                            With regard to such elements, <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> will
                            disassociate itself from and no longer supply them. President then said
                            inasmuch as such elements may want to continue struggle, they may refuse
                            to disarm.</p>
                        <p>President summed up that foregoing was what he had decided to do. As to
                            arrangements, he said details would be subject to discussions between
                            two governments. He said he would look to US Government for assistance
                            in carrying out arrangements. He concluded his statement with request
                            that I promptly take up implementing details with Foreign Ministry.</p>
                        <p>I thanked President for his response which I knew to be painful and
                            difficult one, adding I thought it appropriate to our requirements. I
                            said I was at disposal of Foreign Ministry to help in working out
                            evacuation. I urged speed in implementation of evacuation and asked
                            President to use his influence to get greatest number to lay down arms.
                            He responded faster evacuation carried out the better but repeated what
                            he had said earlier about determination of some irregulars to fight on
                            no matter what he might say or do. I also suggested early <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> discussions with Laos and Thailand and

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SC1">Shen</persName> said to his knowledge this
                            was first time President had ever acknowledged irregulars in Burma were
                            of no benefit to <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> cause. He said he
                            was sure President meant what he said and would sincerely cooperate to
                            return to Taiwan those willing to come back. He was also certain no
                            further attempt would be made to supply irregulars who choose to remain
                            behind.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SC1">Shen</persName> was obviously relieved and
                            pleased with outcome of what has been until recently an obscure
                            nightmare to him. I believe he played an important role in bringing
                            President around and I congratulated him warmly.</p>
                        <p>I asked <persName corresp="#p_SC1">Shen</persName> if he had any idea
                            what cooperation would be required of us and he said he frankly could
                            not say. He said he had been so busy working on President he had not yet
                            had time to give implementing measures thought. He seemed to agree
                            orders would have to go to irregulars through military channels and he
                            appeared to think this would be done through hands of <persName corresp="#p_CC2">Chiang Ching-kuo</persName>. He also agreed <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would find it necessary to discuss
                            evacuation and asylum problems with Lao and Thai Governments but said
                            proposals would require some thought and care.</p>
                        <p>In response to my urging that speedy implementation be undertaken,
                                <persName corresp="#p_SC1">Shen</persName> intimated <persName corresp="#p_CC2">Chiang Ching-kuo</persName> would be instrumental
                            in this regard. He suggested in his absence I keep in touch with Vice
                            Foreign Minister Hsu and perhaps <persName corresp="#p_CC2">Chiang
                                Ching-kuo</persName>. At close of conversations <persName corresp="#p_SC1">Shen</persName> urged that both governments
                            exercise greatest care regarding publicity. Apparently having in mind
                            assurances made in 1953 and 1954, he said he believed both governments
                            should avoid statements harmful to other and which could give comfort to
                            Communists who would do all in their power to create difficulty and
                            embarrassment. In this regard, <persName corresp="#p_SC1">Shen</persName> also obviously had in mind difficulty <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would have in ever admitting it had
                            sent forces or arms to Burma in violation of earlier pledges. I believe
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> is hopeful public statements
                            regarding disarming and evacuation of irregulars be kept to absolute
                            minimum. I hope we can meet <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> wishes
                            in this respect.</p>

                        <p>We recognize here only first step has been surmounted and we face a long

                        </list>
                        <p>The President opened this subject with a reference to recent public
                            British statements bearing on the Chinese representation matter, a
                            subject which we had not yet had opportunity to discuss in depth
                            privately <pb n="21" xml:id="pg_21" facs="0057"/>with the British. He
                            emphasized that however the matter might be handled in the United
                            Nations, it was important to assure that there be no abandonment of the
                            Republic of China on Formosa. Referring to the loss of support for the
                            moratorium procedure, the President said that in connection with the
                            other means of handling this question there were three important dangers
                            from the American viewpoint which must be avoided.</p>
                        <p>First, the matter must be dealt with in such a way as not to cause loss
                            of support in this country for the United Nations, which could be the
                            outcome if the Chinese Communists were to gain admission. Second, China
                            questions must be dealt with in such a way as not to cause deep
                            divisions within our nation, and he mentioned former President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>'s strong views on the China
                            question and the risks that a national debate on the subject might
                            entail, including the risk of mounting isolationist sentiment. Third, he
                            pointed out the damage which would be done to United States prestige if
                            we were to suffer a defeat on this issue and implied that a weakening of
                            United States leadership would have most unfortunate effects not only
                            within this country but abroad in the free world as well. He
                            emphatically agreed with a remark that along the periphery of Asia a
                            weakening of the United States position or a defeat could have the most
                            serious repercussions as respects the continued independence of the
                            smaller countries, which, of course, would affect the security of other
                            nations as well.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he thought of the China issue in terms of United
                            States national interest and he was not particularly concerned by
                            legalisms or theory in relation to the China problem. He had come into
                            office with perhaps a more open mind on this issue and had been prepared
                            to take such steps as might be possible to bring about a less tense
                            atmosphere and to make it possible to seek some sort of a developing
                            relationship. If he had found that there were, in fact, possibilities,
                            he would have been prepared to tackle the very deepseated and emotional
                            opposition throughout this country from such groups as the Committee of
                            One Million,<note n="1" xml:id="d9fn1">Reference is to The Committee of
                                One Million Against the Admission of Communist China to the United
                                Nations. Numerous petitions that the committee sent to Congress in
                                the spring and summer of 1961 to be forwarded to the White House are
                                in Department of State, Central File 303.</note> because he felt
                            that if he could show that new steps were in the national interest they
                            would be accepted in the end and that they would be the right thing.
                            However, it quickly became apparent that the Chinese Communists were
                            just as hostile to the new administration as they were to the old, and
                            were attacking him personally already. Their attitude indicated that
                            they did not wish to be on better terms with us but preferred to
                            maintain an intransigeant position. The possibilities, therefore, seemed
                            very limited indeed. Thus, the United States position <pb n="22" xml:id="pg_22" facs="0058"/>remained substantially unchanged and
                            certainly there was no question at all of diplomatic recognition.</p>
                        <p>Mr. McIntosh inquired whether there was any interest here in an idea
                            emphasized in the London Economist, of using Japan to explore some
                            approach for better relations with Communist China, thus avoiding a
                            direct commitment of United States prestige. The President answered in
                            the negative and commented briefly on the Japanese position, which was
                            one of desiring some sort of relation with its neighbor, China, but not
                            at the risk of alienating the United States and impairing Japan's
                            security. The President went on to indicate that we were going to make
                            some limited exploratory gestures such as by raising the question of
                            exchange of journalists in the Warsaw talks but we had to recognize that
                            all the indications were that the Chinese Communists were not willing to
                            take a position which could facilitate a solution of major questions
                            such as the Chinese representation issue.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister Holyoake wondered whether the question would get any
                            easier with the passage of time and whether we might not have to
                            recognize early in the new administration that the seating of the
                            Chinese Communists would have to be faced. The President replied that
                            this would depend on what the consequences might be in terms of our
                            national interest and particularly the effect on Formosa and the Asian
                            countries. If it were worthwhile, he would, he replied, be willing to
                            face this difficult issue domestically. He referred in this connection
                            to the strength of feeling in Congress among members of both
                            parties.</p>

                        <p>931. Following is guidance for 103rd meeting:</p>
                        <p>1. Begin your presentation with following prepared statement: “Mr.
                            Ambassador, since last meeting a new administration has taken over <pb n="23" xml:id="pg_23" facs="0059"/>conduct of affairs of United
                            States Government. This administration is firmly committed to cause of
                            freedom. It also recognizes that far-reaching differences exist between
                            basic concepts of our two sides. Developments such as statement issued
                            December 6, 1960 following ‘Moscow Conference of Representatives of
                            Communist and Workers' Parties,’ and in particular official comments
                            issued by your side since January 20 criticizing new United States
                            administration, have made us even more aware of basic differences
                            between us. In all frankness we are not encouraged by lack of civility
                            displayed by your side toward United States and its government.
                            Nevertheless, for our part we are willing to overlook what your side has
                            said and follow procedure of discussing differences between us in manner
                            which would avoid mutual recrimination and be more conducive to cause of
                            peace. We believe that if your side will follow suit, these discussions
                            can then deal with specific points in ways which would accord with best
                            interests our two sides.”</p>
                        <p>2. Continue along lines that in our view most productive first step
                            toward improving conduct of talks would be to resolve problem of
                            Americans imprisoned by <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName>'s
                            side. As <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> may have observed,
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s release of American airmen
                            held by it<note n="1" xml:id="d10fn1">Reference is to the release on
                                January 25 of two members of the crew of a U.S. RB-47 aircraft,

                            about climate of civility between US and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Although we do not underestimate extent of basic
                            differences dividing us, we regard this climate of civility as being
                            preferable to one of rancor and bitterness, and as opening up
                            possibility for improvement in US-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                            relations. If <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName>'s side can
                            deal with matter of imprisoned Americans in spirit similar to that of
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, practical obstacle to better
                            relations between <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName>'s side
                            and ours can be eliminated.</p>
                        <p>3. Tell <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> that further step
                            toward improving relations between our two sides would be his side's
                            admission of American newsmen. Remind <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> that his side did not interpose question of agreed
                            announcement in admitting Edgar Snow, who had validated passport issued
                            by United States Government. We would be pleased to see his side admit
                            in same fashion any or all of remaining newsmen who are eligible receive

                            Invite <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> provide us with list
                            of his side's correspondents who desire entry into United States, and
                            assure him that we will take under immediate consideration the issuance
                            of visas to these individuals once they apply. You may tell <pb n="24" xml:id="pg_24" facs="0060"/>
                            <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> that in this way we believe
                            arrangement can be worked out whereby his side's correspondents can be
                            admitted to United States in numbers which would be equal to number of
                            American newsmen admitted by his side. Foregoing approach intended
                            satisfy <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName>'s side's insistence
                            on reciprocity while at same time honoring United States immigration
                            laws, which must, of course, be complied with. In our judgment this
                            approach provides simple and workable means of effecting travel of
                            newsmen, and we urge <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName>'s side
                            give it full consideration.</p>
                        <p>4. In event <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> raises question
                            of Taiwan and reiterates call for United States withdrawal, mention that
                            throughout history of talks we have never sought to compel his side
                            abandon its claim to Taiwan. We have attempted only to gain his side's
                            agreement to press its claim by peaceful means rather than by threat or
                            use of force. Accordingly, renunciation of force is fundamental
                            ingredient in any constructive and meaningful discussions between us on
                            this issue, and our past position this subject remains unchanged.</p>
                        <p>5. Conceivable that <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> may
                            raise topic of food shortages on China mainland and accuse United States
                            of attempting magnify situation for propaganda purposes. If so, cite
                            press conference remarks President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> January 25 to effect that United States has no
                            intention of offering food merely to make propaganda efforts.<note n="3" xml:id="d10fn3">
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> stated that if there
                                was both a desire and a need for food, “the United States would be
                                glad to consider that need, regardless of the source.” He added,
                                however, that the Chinese Communists had recently been exporting
                                food and had been expressing “a rather belligerent attitude” toward
                                the United States. The President concluded: “there is no indication,
                                direct or indirect, private or public, that they would respond
                                favorably to any acts by the United States.” For text of these

                            States would be glad to consider answering need. If people's lives are
                            involved, United States will always do what it can to help on purely
                            humanitarian grounds. (Conversely, in unlikely contingency that

                            statement with reference to fact this was first meeting of new year and
                            that new administration had assumed <pb n="26" xml:id="pg_26" facs="0062"/>office in US. Said despite lack of progress past five
                            years hoped US Government now prepared make new constructive proposals.
                            All that was needed to improve relations was for US to withdraw from
                            armed occupation of Taiwan. Concluded that even though Taiwan problem
                            had not been settled past 11 years it surely would be during next 11
                            years and sooner it was settled the better.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> expressed disappointment my
                            presentation contained no positive proposal concerning Taiwan. Regarding
                            prisoners he pointed out that although RB-47 flyers had been released,
                            U-2 pilot Powers still held. Added that this side had taken several
                            steps such as release of 11 US flyers in 1955 in effort improve
                            atmosphere but US had failed respond. Furthermore, US continued place
                            obstructions in way of Chinese wishing return their country. Regarding
                            newsmen he declared he had put forward reasonable proposal September

                            saying until Taiwan problem solved, it was very difficult make progress
                            on other issues.</p>
                        <p>I pointed out that far from failing to respond to Chinese Communist
                            release of 11 flyers US had already before that occurred removed all
                            restrictions on departure Chinese from US. I said his allegations
                            Chinese being prevented from leaving were unsupported by any evidence
                            and reminded him that we had yet to receive any complaint on behalf of a
                            Chinese from Indian Embassy. On newsmen I expressed hope that his
                            negative response was not final word regarding our new proposal and
                            urged that his side give it further consideration. I added that in view
                            interest this subject in US my government reserved right to make public
                            statement. <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> was silent as to

                            that the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> continue to be represented
                            in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>; that a consensus be developed
                            in the free world that the people on Taiwan are entitled to a separate
                            existence from the mainland; and that the U.S. commitment to defend
                            Taiwan be spread among our allies. We would hope to use the widespread
                            conviction among members that Taiwan deserves continued representation
                            in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, and the ChiComs' objection to
                            sitting in that body with another Chinese regime, to transfer to their
                            backs the monkey of unreasonable opposition, and thus keep them out. We
                            see the liquidation of the dangerous confrontation around the offshores
                            as a means whereby the civil war might be turned into a period of a de
                            facto peace, with 100 miles of blue water between the contestants, in
                            which the needed free-world consensus about Taiwan's right to a separate
                            future might grow; and would seek to use evacuation of the offshores as
                            an inducement which might be offered our allies for sharing our
                            commitment to defend Taiwan.</p>
                        <p>We recognize that bringing about the readjustments we propose will at
                            best be a most difficult task: President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> is too deeply and publicly committed to a return
                            to the mainland to publicly disavow that ambition; and his leadership
                            cannot be greatly damaged without also disrupting the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> itself. Hence those readjustments will
                            only be possible if we give all possible consideration to the
                            requirements of his “face”; hold out the inducements of greater U.S.
                            assistance; and be prepared to press on the sensitive nerve which is
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> dependence on us for its
                            continued existence.</p>

                            which envisaged an overall approach to the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>: We felt that a new administration can most easily
                            alter policies while it was new; that our two governments might as well
                            reach a basic understanding sooner rather than later; and that some
                            elements in an overall approach can be mutually supporting. It is the
                            feeling in <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss>, which faces the difficult
                            practical problems of dealing with the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>, that we should not embarrass chances of getting it to
                            cooperate in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> membership problem by
                            presenting it at the same time with the much larger dose of bitter
                            medicine which evacuation of the offshore islands would represent. The
                            memo in its present form does not choose between these alternatives, but
                            they need to be faced as alternatives and a choice made.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary began the discussion by observing one can always hope that
                            the U.S. and the U.K. could get together on the problem of China. In
                            1949, perhaps, an argument could have been made for either the U.S. or
                            U.K. position. Now it was a tragedy that we had divergent policies. We
                            see no prospect at this time of U.S. recognition of Communist China.
                            Peiping continues its extreme hostility toward this country and its
                            attitude to the new Administration is equally uncompromising. It
                            continues to take the position that Formosa must become a part of
                            Communist China. We feel the possibility of any change in the situation
                            is up to Peiping and not to us. During the last Warsaw talks there was
                            no indication of any change in their position. It was reiterated that
                            the U.S. must get its troops off Formosa which is Peiping's traditional
                            way of pressing for our abandonment of Formosa. They refused to accept a
                            list of names for an reciprocal exchange of newspapermen, and they will
                            not release our prisoners. Despite these circumstances we plan to
                            continue the contact in Warsaw in order to have a forum for some sort of
                            “dialogue”. We believe that Peiping at an appropriate stage might be
                            brought into the nuclear testing and disarmament talks. If they go
                            successfully, it would be essential to have them included in the
                            discussions and to sign any agreements reached. We have a bilateral
                            security agreement with Formosa. We expect to stand by it and would use
                            force to prevent Formosa from being taken over by the mainland. Our
                            position is not just because of public opinion here but is based also on
                            the strategic situation and the attitudes of our Far East Allies. We
                            recognize this position in itself constitutes an obstacle to
                            normalization of our relations with Peiping. We hope others throughout
                            the Free World will in time recognize the necessity of the maintenance
                            of Formosa's independence. We are concerned about the off-shore islands
                            problem and will have to take a look at what can be done about it. We
                            regret that Admiral Radford and Mr. Robertson were not successful in
                            their efforts.<note n="1" xml:id="d13fn1">Reference is to a mission to

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CSH1">Caccia</persName> responded the
                            British have always understood our position. They agree the blame for
                            the situation is Peiping's and the <pb n="30" xml:id="pg_30" facs="0066"/>latter's demands would be too large to swallow. The U.K. agrees
                            furthermore that millions of people “should not be handed around”. The
                            off-shore islands present a different problem from a legal standpoint
                            from that of Formosa which is legitimatized by the Cairo declaration.
                            The Secretary commented he wouldn't want to spell out the legal problems
                            as far as the Cairo declaration is concerned but he would not suppose
                            that under it, Peiping could really make any claim to Formosa.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador at this point inquired whether we might agree to a joint
                            assessment about the following:</p>
                        <p>A) The political and economic strength of China.</p>
                        <p>B) Sino-Soviet differences and ways of exploiting them.</p>
                        <p>C) Probable future trends in Chinese foreign relations, particularly with
                            Japan.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary agreed. It was understood that the two intelligence
                            communities would be asked to participate in these assessments. The
                            Under Secretary observed that if for any reason we were to agree to
                            discuss possible recognition of Communist China with Peiping, the very
                            first question we would be asked would be to give up Formosa. Right at
                            that point the talks would have to stop. The Ambassador thought this was
                            a good point and one we should make clear around the world. The Under
                            Secretary agreed and believed if really understood, we would be in a
                            stronger position in the eyes of world opinion.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then turned to the subject of Chinese representation in the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. He stated we cannot as of this
                            moment spell out the full parliamentary position. We do not seek as an
                            objective of U.S. policy Peiping's admission to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. Our objective would be to put ourselves
                            in a reasonable light and position in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and then leave the problem of Peiping to others. We
                            would not wish to move from what many call our unrealistic attitude to
                            an unrealistic position. If the question of a seat for China comes up as
                            a credentials matter regardless of the vote, the outcome would have an
                            unrealistic result. There are two organisms each claiming they represent
                            all of China. Neither has control over the areas it claims; each have
                            the attribution of statehood and population criteria for admission to
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. We, therefore, do not look upon
                            the problem as procedural or technical but rather one of a wide-range
                            political character. We believe it would be disastrous if the matter
                            were settled on a procedural vote. It is fundamental to the United
                            States that Formosa retain a seat in the United Nations. If this is
                            unacceptable to Peiping then they are at fault. We don't believe we
                            should have to pay the ticket for Peiping's admission at Formosa's
                            expenses. If Peiping won't accept admission under these conditions, then
                            that is their choice and we would not be responsible. There is a further
                            complication on how the matter is handled in the General Assembly and
                            the Security Council. On the assumption it couldn't be dealt with
                            satisfactorily as a credentials matter, the outcome <pb n="31" xml:id="pg_31" facs="0067"/>in the General Assembly would probably
                            be satisfactory. This would not be true in the Security Council. The
                            Ambassador inquired how we proposed to proceed, was the moratorium to be
                            continued? etc. The Secretary replied we would have to look at the
                            situation closer to the time. What he had just previously said, however,
                            was based on the assumption that the moratorium has exhausted itself.
                            Unless, because of some new crisis, the situation changes by September,
                            it would appear that the moratorium has “run out of votes”. The
                            Ambassador asked how we prevent the problem from not being handled as
                            one of “who sits in China's seat”. Could we be sure we would succeed?
                            Heretofore, the moratorium has been handled as a procedural problem at
                            the U.S. request, i.e., a simple majority vote. The Secretary thought
                            that the moratorium had truly been a procedural problem whereas the
                            other involves the important question which country is entitled to sit
                            in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. The Ambassador again inquired
                            how we expected to get the votes and wouldn't we have to line up other
                            governments. The Secretary answered there obviously would have to be
                            consultation, but closer to the time. He observed we would like to start
                            with the U.K. vote. <persName corresp="#p_HLAFD1">Lord</persName>
                            <persName corresp="#p_HVS1">Hood</persName> felt that if everyone knew
                            beforehand the U.S. was prepared to see the admission of Peiping so long
                            as Formosa could remain in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> then it
                            might be possible to get the necessary votes. The Ambassador added there
                            remained the question who would get the Security Council seat. The
                            Secretary observed this issue couldn't be settled by any action of the
                            General Assembly. Its action would have to be confined to the seating of
                            a member in the General Assembly. The Ambassador asked whether Formosa
                            would continue on the Security Council. The Secretary replied
                            affirmatively.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJM1">Steeves</persName> commented that if the
                            moratorium is licked then such countries as Malaya and others would for
                            the first time begin to think twice before throwing Formosa out of the
                            Security Council. The Ambassador commented that the U.K. would be in the
                            following position if the question of who is entitled to China's
                            Security Council seat came to a vote: The U.K. would have to vote for
                            Peiping because it recognizes that Government. If we had any ideas how
                            the Formosa seat could be retained despite the fact the U.K. would have
                            to vote for Peiping, he would be interested in hearing about them. The
                            Secretary commented the problem could be relieved by the U.K.'s
                            recognition of Formosa. The Ambassador replied they could not do this
                            because the U.K. would be thrown out of Peiping. He believed, therefore,
                            the U.S. should try to get Peiping's agreement to two delegations. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CJH1">Cleveland</persName> inquired whether
                            the British felt an offer of conditional membership to Peiping was
                            salable subject to the requirement that Formosa retain its membership in
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. The Ambassador thought this was
                            doubtful but possibly worth exploring. He thought it very important that
                            we should be making our position known to others soon so it could be
                            realized the U.S. wasn't <pb n="32" xml:id="pg_32" facs="0068"/>just
                            standing pat on the moratorium anymore. The Secretary said that for us
                            the problem is not one of finding a place for Formosa, it was rather
                            does the United Nations wish to find a place for Peiping. He added our
                            own tactics will depend somewhat on studies presently underway in
                            Formosa. We will not take our marching orders as a result of these
                            studies but it will be helpful to know whether Formosa continues to take
                            the position that Peiping should not be admitted to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. The Secretary observed that we do not
                            expect to consult unduly until our views have crystallized more. The
                            present exchange with the British was because of our exceptionally close
                            relations. He stressed its confidential nature.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HLAFD1">Lord</persName>
                            <persName corresp="#p_HVS1">Hood</persName> inquired if we were content
                            to accept a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> majority decision to admit
                            Peiping so long as Formosa remained, then what would the situation be in
                            the Security Council? The Secretary felt it was possible to visualize
                            both having seats in the General Assembly but that in the Security
                            Council, we would find it difficult to accept that the problem was a
                            credentials matter. If considered on a procedural vote, the Republic of
                            China would probably vote against it. The matter might then be referred
                            to the International Court. If we get into a wrangle in the Security
                            Council, then there would be pressure to open the entire membership of
                            the Security Council. The Ambassador wondered whether there would not be
                            some advantage to starting all over again. Inasmuch as no government
                            represents all of China, perhaps Formosa might stand down or aside and
                            then we could have a new negotiation about membership in the Security
                            Council. The Secretary thought this might be possible and in fact might
                            be the only chance to renegotiate Security Council membership. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SJM1">Steeves</persName> felt the best we
                            could hope for would be that Formosa might choose not to exercise its
                            right to a Security Council seat while the Security Council membership
                            was being renegotiated. The Ambassador reiterated his fear of any
                            breakdown between us if events reached a point whereby the U.K. would
                            have to vote for Peiping's admission. The Secretary asked whether this
                            was because Peiping would break relations with the U.K. or because of
                            the logic of the situation. The Ambassador replied the latter. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MGGC1">McGhee</persName> inquired what would
                            be the U.K. attitude to a resolution stating that Formosa should retain
                            membership in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. The Ambassador
                            replied that as long as we didn't oppose Peiping's admission he thought
                            the U.K. could abstain. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MGGC1">McGhee</persName> asked whether <persName>Chiang</persName>'s
                            position on the off-shore islands was a critical matter to the U.K. The
                            Ambassador replied yes. <persName>Chiang</persName>'s withdrawal from
                            the off-shore islands would have a helpful effect on world public
                            opinion. The Secretary asked whether HMG has a positive policy to seat
                            Peiping in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> or whether its policy
                            is “to be on a better wicket in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>”.
                            The Ambassador replied the latter. The West has been losing ground and
                            the moratorium has run out of support. The Secretary said then if there
                            was a reasonable posture in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and
                            Peiping turned <pb n="33" xml:id="pg_33" facs="0069"/>it down, could we
                            assume that the British would not be overly bothered. The Ambassador
                            agreed. The Secretary added that if the dead-lock were on “another
                            basis” would the British feel happier. The Ambassador again agreed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Ledward commented that the U.K. would have more difficulty if Peiping
                            had to apply for membership in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            than if Formosa had to apply. The Secretary observed something quite new
                            might be possible. He pointed out that after the partition of India both
                            India and Pakistan had seats in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>;
                            India retaining its seat and Pakistan was admitted as a new nation. It
                            was possible the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> could pass a
                            resolution in effect saying what is now one country has become two
                            countries. As for the Security Council problem we might respond to the
                            interest of new countries in renewing the membership of the Security
                            Council. A study could be undertaken. We would be in no hurry.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YGKC1">Yeh</persName> called on the
                            Secretary at the latter's request this morning. The Secretary opened the
                            conversation by inquiring whether Ambassador T.F. <persName corresp="#p_TT1">Tsiang</persName> had returned to New York.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YGKC1">Yeh</persName> explained that
                            Dr. <persName corresp="#p_TT1">Tsiang</persName> had not gone to Taipei
                            for consultation; he had remained in New York in order to consult with
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> on the
                            prospects for using the moratorium again. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YGKC1">Yeh</persName> expressed the view of his
                            government that the moratorium should not be given up lightly but that
                            steps should be taken to see how many votes could be obtained in support
                            of it.</p>
                        <pb n="34" xml:id="pg_34" facs="0070"/>
                        <p>The Secretary responded that he was not surprised that the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> hoped to continue the moratorium.
                            However, he thought that the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> should
                            consider alternatives. He pointed out that a growing number of United
                            Nations members feel that the subject of Chinese representation should
                            at least be discussed in the General Assembly. There was also a feeling
                            among members that the moratorium was running out of votes and they were
                            losing patience with it. Thus it looked as though the subject was going
                            to come up for debate in the next General Assembly. (It had, of course,
                            been decided for the resumed General Assembly.)</p>
                        <p>The Secretary emphasized that there would be no change in the bilateral
                            relations between the United States and China. The United States would
                            continue to recognize the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>. On the
                            other hand, there was no prospect that Peiping would be recognized both
                            because of its own policy and of United States policy.</p>
                        <p>The United Nations problem was more complicated, however; the
                            parliamentary situation there was very difficult. To us the most
                            disastrous result would be to have the issue treated as a credentials
                            question—as a question of which delegation should be seated in China's
                            seat. If the moratorium expires, it means that a majority of members
                            want to have the issue discussed, not necessarily that the majority
                            wants Peiping to replace the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> in the
                            United Nations. A serious parliamentary threat, which we must guard
                            against, is the technical possibility that a bare majority would decide
                            that this is a credentials matter. We think it is not simply a
                            credentials matter but an important matter of far reaching implications.
                            The seating of the Peiping regime is not an objective of policy of some
                            members who vote for the seating of Peiping or against the moratorium.
                            The Ambassador asked if the Secretary was thinking of the United
                            Kingdom. The Secretary said he was thinking of a number of countries. He
                            indicated we should try to get away from the present deadlock which
                            involves a considerable risk and produce another deadlock but on a more
                            advantageous position. At this point the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> should consider its attitude on this key question. How
                            does it feel on the choice between an all-or-nothing position, on the
                            one hand, and the determination to remain a member of the United
                            Nations, on the other? If the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> takes
                            an all-or-nothing position, it is likely that a majority of United
                            Nations members will insist on dealing with the issue as a credentials
                            question. If the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> concentrates on
                            retaining its position in the United Nations, however, then the prospect
                            is that Peiping will refuse to take up membership on the grounds that
                            the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> is still in the United Nations,
                            and a deadlock will ensue for which Peiping will bear the
                            responsibility. The Secretary said that if the issue were decided to be
                            an important matter, there would probably not be a two-third's majority
                            for any solution. The key point is the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>'s attitude on the question of all-or-nothing.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said he would faithfully report what the Secretary had
                            said to his government. He regarded it as being very important. He <pb n="35" xml:id="pg_35" facs="0071"/>could not answer the Secretary's
                            question as to whether his government would take an all-or-nothing
                            approach or concentrate on remaining in the United Nations. Although he
                            could not give his government's answer to this question, as a personal
                            footnote he could point out that in response to a strong recommendation
                            on his part the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> had instructed its
                            Charge d'Affaires to remain in Senegal (at least temporarily) even
                            though the Senegal Government had decided to recognize Communist
                                China.<note n="1" xml:id="d14fn1">Telegram 602 from Dakar, March 15,
                                reported that Senegal's Prime Minister had informed the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> Charge on March 14 that Senegal had
                                decided to recognize the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> but
                                that it did not intend to establish diplomatic relations with the
                                    <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> and hoped the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would maintain its Embassy in
                                Dakar. (Department of State, Central Files, 793.02/3-1561)</note>
                            Thus, for the time being any way, the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> had not taken an all-or-nothing attitude in Senegal.
                            The Ambassador also recalled the situation which had arisen in Melbourne
                            in the 1956 Olympic Games. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKC1">Yeh</persName>, who was then Foreign Minister, had decided to send
                            a <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> team to Melbourne despite the
                            presence of the Chinese Communists. As a result, Peiping withdrew from
                            the Olympics. The Ambassador emphasized that in these personal footnotes
                            he was not suggesting what his government's policy would be on the
                            United Nations question. However, these were cases where his government
                            had determined to participate regardless of whether the Chinese
                            Communists came or not.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary emphasized that the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>'s
                            attitude was crucial in the determination of how to deal with the
                            subject in the United Nations. He noted that Peiping had made
                            acknowledgment of its claim to Formosa a condition to United Nations
                            membership. If the United Nations insists that the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> retain an independent seat this would
                            represent a major breach in Peiping's claim to Formosa, and require a
                            major shift in Peiping's policy for it to accept United Nations
                            membership.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YGKC1">Yeh</persName> said he felt sure
                            his government would not want to leave the United Nations in favor of
                            Peiping but would stay on because it has a right to be there. However,
                            the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would not want to change its
                            national name. At the San Francisco Conference, the name Republic of
                            China had been deliberately chosen instead of China by the Chinese
                            delegation. Former Ambassador Koo had remarked at the time that this
                            choice of name might be important as a criterion in the future (the
                            Ambassador noted that the Chinese delegation had included Communist
                            representatives). The Secretary doubted that much could be rested on
                            this point in the United Nations. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKC1">Yeh</persName> agreed, but reiterated the importance that the
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> attached to retaining its own
                            name. If the Peiping government were voted in, it should be in its own
                            name as the “People's Republic of China”.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador analyzed briefly the voting in the 15th General Assembly
                            on the moratorium, pointing out that the favorable votes had decreased
                            from 44 to 42, with the loss of Cuba and Ethiopia, and the abstentions
                            had increased from 9 to 22, including 14 African states. The <pb n="36" xml:id="pg_36" facs="0072"/>
                            <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> had established diplomatic relations
                            with 11 African states. He thought that some of these 11 would vote for
                            the moratorium. Probably Brazil's vote might be lost, and Mexico and
                            Pakistan would abstain. He asked the Secretary if the United Kingdom
                            would part ways with the United States. The Secretary replied that it
                            would be difficult for the United Kingdom to continue to support the
                            moratorium formula, but we could find some other formula which would
                            result in a deadlock. The United Kingdom and others who don't feel it is
                            an objective of their policy to bring Peiping into the United Nations
                            could vote for it. A number of countries now feel that there is an
                            unreality about the present situation, but we could get a good deal of
                            help from them if we could develop a reasonable proposal which would
                            bring about a deadlock and shift the onus to Peiping. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_YGKC1">Yeh</persName> asked if this would mean
                            putting the question on a two-third's basis since the Chinese Communists
                            could not get a two-thirds majority in their favor. The Secretary
                            indicated this might be one alternative on the parliamentary trail. He
                            emphasized that the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> should mobilize
                            international support for the conservation of what it has on Formosa
                            even from those who already recognize Peiping.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador asked what countries had indicated that they were tired of
                            the moratorium. The Secretary said we do not have a complete list but he
                            pointed out that the principal opposition comes from among those
                            delegations where we have the least political capital. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_YGKC1">Yeh</persName> remarked that those who
                            say we must discuss the issue want to see Red China come in. The
                            Secretary said he didn't know about that and cited the fact that
                            President Quadros of Brazil had made clear that he was interested in
                            discussing the issue but was not committed on admission of Communist
                            China. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YGKC1">Yeh</persName> said that,
                            according to his information, Quadros was thinking about recognizing
                            Peiping at the time he issued his instructions to his United Nations
                            delegation but he had since changed his mind. In closing the Ambassador
                            expressed the hope that while these discussions were going on between
                            his government and the United States American officials would refrain
                            from making public statements on the issue. The Secretary emphasized
                            that we were being pressed on this matter and we had to make decisions
                            soon. It was therefore very important that the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> reach a decision on the question he had earlier put to
                            the Ambassador.<note n="2" xml:id="d14fn2">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YGKC1">Yeh</persName> called on Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> on March 22 requesting more
                                detailed information on the U.S. position. <persName corresp="#p_YGKC1">Yeh</persName> stated that he had received
                                telegrams from Taipei indicating that his government would face
                                extreme difficulties in agreeing to any “two Chinas” formula. He
                                gave <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> several questions
                                and asked for his comments, but <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> replied that the questions were procedural ones
                                deriving from broad policy issues; the real question was whether the
                                    <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would insist on an
                                all-or-nothing approach. When <persName corresp="#p_YGKC1">Yeh</persName> stated that he could not present a plan to his
                                government without saying how it would work, <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> replied that the United States
                                was not presenting a plan; the nature of any plan that was worked
                                out would depend upon the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>

                                20, 1961, 7 p.m.</date>

                        <p>571. For first time since I came to Taiwan three years ago, I sense a
                            feeling among high <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> authorities that
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> is looking for some way out of
                            China impasse at their expense. Thus far this “feeling” appears not to
                            have seeped down to lower official levels or to general public. This
                            attitude has its genesis in US election campaign and accompanying
                            debates, change of administration, and public utterances of well known
                            Americans who have become high officials and who are felt in position to
                            influence US policy. Uneasiness has been heightened by what is believed
                            to be US disposition to reach accommodation with ChiComs if only latter
                            would unbend, and US shift toward advocacy of neutral Laos. Issue of
                            sharpest focus currently however is <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            representation. <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> authorities are
                            deeply disturbed because they consider new administration has not come
                            out unreservedly in support of <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> on
                            this issue. They see US Government as fearful of its ability to preserve
                            moratorium formula and prepared to toss in towel. There are officials
                            here, and they are thought to include those in highest circles, who are
                            coming to believe <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> is prepared to
                            plump for “two Chinas”. That there are responsible Chinese officials
                            prepared to believe this preposterous and mistaken idea is testimony to
                            decline taking place in their confidence in United States. It is also
                            reflective on their extreme sensitivity to mere thought of any solution
                            smacking of “two Chinas” which would be contrary to their fundamental
                            doctrine of return to mainland and liberation of compatriots.</p>
                        <p>As I interpret thinking of <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> officials,
                            they believe maintenance of moratorium formula remains best tactic and
                            they profess to believe if only <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> will
                            place shoulder to wheel wholeheartedly and unreservedly, moratorium will
                            win again. Because of repugnance for “two Chinas” <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> is most reluctant to advance or discuss
                            alternatives suggestive in any way of “two Chinas”. Even if some such
                            tactic were adopted with a view to keeping ChiComs out <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, there are officials here who believe
                            that once door is opened other pressures would be applied by powers
                            intent on ChiCom admission which would force <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> to leave <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. Point to
                            remember here is that <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would prefer
                            to be out of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to representing only
                            Taiwan.</p>
                        <p>We are clearly faced with a problem of great delicacy and one on which
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> may not find it possible to
                            yield at all. I believe it will be very difficult to sell <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> officials on any formula with a “two
                            Chinas” connotation <pb n="38" xml:id="pg_38" facs="0074"/>even if for
                            tactical purposes only. Any approaches we make in this direction must be
                            handled with utmost subtlety and tact lest <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> be driven in desperation to withdrawing from <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and going it alone. In my view,
                            leadership here is quite capable of such course of action if pushed too
                            hard or driven into corner. Of course such state of affairs would shake
                            stability of Taiwan and could give ChiComs opportunity they have sought
                            for years to take Taiwan without a struggle.</p>
                        <p>I have been engaged recently in almost daily talks with Foreign Minister

                            representation has invariably come up and I have done my best to assure
                            them of constancy of US position, of US opposition to “two Chinas” and
                            of US opposition to ChiCom admission to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. On March 18 I spoke of Secretary's desire for <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>'s idea of solution and urged that one
                            be provided.</p>
                        <p>Foregoing was prepared prior to receipt of Deptel 471<note n="1" xml:id="d15fn1">Dated March 18; it summarized the conversation

                            all of our policy makers. “The Great Leap Forward” in China apparently
                            has landed it in the soup.</p>
                        <p>I have talked with some of his staff most concerned with China, with
                            “China hands,” and with Chinese friends. They picture a China weakened
                                <pb n="39" xml:id="pg_39" facs="0075"/>by overwork and malnutrition,
                            a political regime being forced by growing discontent to start relaxing
                            its stringent rules, and clear indications of more trouble to come. It
                            might well be the time to initiate some actions inside China and to keep
                            the pressures on.</p>
                        <p>The immediate troubles in China stem from malnutrition and exhaustion.
                            Unlike historic natural disaster areas in China, 1961 also includes
                            North China. Millet and wheat are not on the market. There is similar
                            shortage of rice in the south. And, this has happened prior to the usual
                            “starvation period” of April-May. A combination of an economy dislocated
                            to fit a political theory, bad weather, and floods brought this
                            about.</p>
                        <p>Last year was a bad year. This year is worst. Next year might continue
                            the trend. 1958, a good crop year, produced 212-million tons of grains
                            (wheat, millet, rice). The estimate for 1961, with some 50-million more
                            mouths to feed, is about 180-million tons of grains. Meat, fish, and
                            oils are disappearing from Chinese diets. Conditions have reawakened the
                            old Chinese political saying, “Three bad harvests and the mandate from
                            heaven changes.”</p>
                        <p>Intelligence estimates now being compiled probably will describe the
                            Chinese people as tired from the long hours of work under the commune
                            system, weak from hunger, but taking their suffering with resignation.
                            Despite trouble in the Army in Shantung and the granary riots there, in
                            Hankow, and on Hainan not long ago, it is not believed that China is on
                            the point of general rebellion. Chinese are realists and know that they
                            would have little chance of succeeding—unless helped from the
                            outside.</p>
                        <p>There is little information on the morale of the Army. Since the military
                            have been a favored class under the Communists, get their rations even
                            when the people starve, and are under the strong control of Lin
                                Piao,<note n="2" xml:id="d16fn2">Minister of Defense in the People's
                                Republic of China.</note> it is probable that the Army is still
                            effective. However, a strong psychological campaign could change this.
                            There are reports that Army men are sending part of their rations home.
                            Some observers feel that <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>
                            wouldn't dare undertake an adventure with his Army now, despite his
                            threats to do so.</p>
                        <p>In summary, Defense responsibilities for our national security dictate
                            that we should make sure that the U.S. takes a hard look at our policy
                            towards China at this time. Holding back from permitting probing actions
                            inside China, feeling that our Seventh Fleet can be looked upon merely
                            as a diplomatic pawn, or giving undue weight to <persName corresp="#p_CEZE1">Chou En-lai</persName>'s political gambits, might
                            well be exactly the wrong thing to do today. The threat of China has
                            hung heavy over our heads in Asia. It may well be that we can start
                            changing this in 1961.</p>

                        <p>The Problem</p>
                        <p>To assess current Chinese Communist economic difficulties, with special
                            reference to the food situation, and to estimate their economic and
                            political consequences: (a) over the next few years, and (b) in the
                            event 1961 should prove a poor crop year.</p>
                        <p>Conclusions</p>
                        <p>1. The Chinese Communist regime is now facing the most serious economic
                            difficulties it has confronted since it consolidated its power over
                            mainland China. As a result of economic mismanagement, and, especially,
                            of two years of unfavorable weather, food production in 1960 was little
                            if any larger than in 1957—at which time there were about 50 million
                            fewer Chinese to feed. Widespread famine does not appear to be at hand,
                            but in some provinces many people are now on a bare subsistence diet and
                            the bitterest suffering lies immediately ahead in the period before the
                            June harvests. The dislocations caused by the “Leap Forward” and the
                            removal of Soviet technicians have disrupted China's industrialization
                            program. These difficulties have sharply reduced the rate of economic
                            growth during 1960 and have created a serious balance of payments
                            problem. Public morale, especially in rural areas, is almost certainly
                            at its lowest point since the Communists assumed power, and there have
                            been some instances of open dissidence. (Paras. 7-25)</p>
                        <p>2. The Chinese Communist regime has responded by giving agriculture a
                            higher priority, dropping the “Leap Forward” approach in industry, and
                            relaxing somewhat the economic demands on the people. Perhaps the best
                            indicator of the severity of the food shortage has been Peiping's action
                            in scheduling the importation of nearly three million tons of
                            food-grains during 1961, at a cost of about $200 million of Communist
                            China's limited foreign currency holdings. (Paras. 26-30)</p>
                        <p>3. While normal crop weather in 1961 would significantly improve farm
                            output over the levels of 1959 and 1960, at least two years of average
                                <pb n="41" xml:id="pg_41" facs="0077"/>or better harvests will be
                            required to overcome the crisis and permit a restoration of the diet to
                            tolerable levels, some rebuilding of domestic stocks, and the resumption
                            of net food exports. If Soviet technicians in large numbers do not
                            return to China, industrial production is likely to increase about 12
                            percent annually, as compared with about 33 percent in 1959 and 16
                            percent in 1960. (Paras. 31-35)</p>
                        <p>4. If 1961 is another poor crop year the economic and political effects
                            for Communist China are likely to be grave. There probably would be no
                            increase in gross national product (<gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss>)
                            in 1961, and growth prospects for later years would also be affected.
                            Unless there were substantial food imports, malnutrition and disease
                            would become widespread, and a considerable amount of starvation
                            probably would occur. Public disaffection probably would become a major
                            problem for the regime, perhaps forcing it to undertake a massive
                            campaign of threats and terror. It is unlikely even in these
                            circumstances, however, that public disaffection could threaten
                            continued control of China by its present leadership. (Paras. 38-40)</p>
                        <p>5. We do not believe that Peiping would accept food offers from the US
                            even under conditions of widespread famine. (Para. 42)</p>
                        <p>6. We do not believe that even famine conditions would, in themselves,
                            cause Peiping to engage in direct military aggression. Such difficulties
                            probably would, however, prompt Peiping to avoid actions which would
                            exacerbate its relations with Moscow. (Paras. 40-41)</p>

                        <p>The President stated it is a fact that there is a division between us on

                                Legal Adviser Leonard C. Meeker briefed the President on the subject
                                at breakfast on April 5. Meeker's record of the conversation is in
                                Department of State, Central Files, 303/4-561. See the

                            of this issue to this country. When he last saw President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> on January 19 the latter
                            stated that he hoped to support him on all foreign policy issues but
                            would feel it necessary to return to political life if the Chinese
                            communists <pb n="43" xml:id="pg_43" facs="0079"/>were admitted to the

                            they are brought in a great wave of distrust about the United Nations
                            would arise. We could not acquiesce in their admission. The problem then
                            is how to prevent us from being defeated in the United Nations and to
                            prevent increasing communist prestige throughout the world. Even though
                            we differ, we assume the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> does not want
                            the US public to distrust the United Nations nor to increase communist
                            prestige. We have been considering various alternatives. There is the
                            position of Formosa in the General Assembly and in the Security Council.
                            There is the problem if there are to be two China's in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, would Communist China be willing to
                            join.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> observed that
                            assuming the objective to keep Taiwan in the United Nations we have been
                            considering various possibilities. Our first objective is to avoid
                            action by simple majority on a credentials vote. On this issue we
                            believe we would be defeated. One possibility would be to have a
                            proposal for a resolution which stated that Communist China was eligible
                            for admission. This would take a two-thirds vote. We would abstain.
                            Whether Taiwan would we don't know. But at this point we doubt, however,
                            such a resolution would get a two-thirds vote. Also, it might look as a
                            delaying tactic by putting Communist China at the mercy of the Republic
                            of China's veto. There is the question also of the Security Council seat
                            problem. Another approach is the successor nation one. This would take
                            the form of a resolution stating that two states have succeeded to
                            China's seat. The Prime Minister asked whether this would be the same as
                            the India and Pakistan example. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> said it was somewhat different; India kept its
                            seat and Pakistan got a new seat. Under the successor nation theory
                            Communist China could apply for admission. Another possibility which has
                            occurred to us would be for the US to make it clear it backs Taiwan as a
                            sovereign country with a right to a seat in the United Nations and let
                            others worry about Peiping. The last alternative we have considered
                            would be to amend the United Nations Charter. In our view probably the
                            best way is for a resolution stating Communist China is eligible to
                            apply for admission. This leaves the problem of the Security Council
                            seat in abeyance for a while. We recognize that the moratorium device
                            has had its day and that something must be done. <persName corresp="#p_HLAFD1">Lord Home</persName> stressed the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> understands the US position. In fact, it
                            does not particularly want Communist China in the United Nations but as
                            the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> has recognized Communist China it
                            would have to vote for it in any credential vote. The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> would be happy to cooperate on any
                            resolution we would want. Nevertheless, <pb n="44" xml:id="pg_44" facs="0080"/>he felt none suggested were practical unless Formosa
                            became a separate independent country without any pretense of any rights
                            to the mainland. The President asked whether it was important whether
                            China and Communist China both claim to represent all of China, or
                            whether the use of the name China for either or both was essential.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DSP1">Patrick Dean</persName> doubted any
                            formula would be acceptable to most members that did not recognize
                            Communist China as in effect China. The Secretary thought the name would
                            have no great importance. We are presently negotiating with Peiping in
                            Warsaw and, the President added, will soon be in the 14 Nation
                                Committee.<note n="3" xml:id="d18fn3">Reference is to the proposed
                                14-nation conference on Laos.</note> The President reiterated we
                            could not support Red China's admittance to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. We needed to find a formula for keeping them from
                            wanting to get in. We believe we are in the best position to defend
                            Formosa's position of having a right to be in. The Secretary thought
                            that if we could get a reasonable position so that the world could see
                            that Communist China has impossible conditions for admission which we
                            could not accept, this would be salutary. The President felt although
                            the fact may be that Formosa should be a separate country the Republic
                            of China won't admit it. He inquired what were the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>'s views as to the effect of a defeat of
                            the US on a direct vote, particularly in Southeast Asia. <persName corresp="#p_HLAFD1">Lord Home</persName> thought the effect would be
                            bad. The Secretary remarked that Americans would pick up the tally vote
                            and wonder why we had not put more pressure on countries voting for Red
                            China. <persName corresp="#p_HLAFD1">Lord Home</persName> reported that
                            at the recent Commonwealth Conference only Menzies was not in favor of
                            seating Communist China in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. The
                            Prime Minister wondered whether it is important what people called
                            themselves. He recalled that the King of England called himself the King
                            of France for many years when in fact he had no such position. He
                            wondered whether we couldn't express it in terms of the truth. There are
                            two countries, each claiming control of the other. Couldn't we have a
                            resolution which would find both should be in the United Nations, a
                            resolution which appealed to everyone along the lines of the successor
                            state theory. <persName corresp="#p_HLAFD1">Lord Home</persName>
                            reiterated that if they both called themselves China there would be
                            difficulty. The President asked whether some other <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> members don't have claims over other
                            areas also. Sir <persName corresp="#p_DSP1">Patrick Dean</persName>
                            observed there are some, India in particular, who want the Security
                            Council enlarged. Possibly, therefore, some resolution might succeed and
                            we could get their help if they understood we are working on the
                            Security Council enlargement problem. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> thought we could get a
                            two-thirds vote this fall on a successor state resolution. The Prime
                            Minister felt this would leave only the problem of name. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_CSH1">Caccia</persName> pointed out such a
                            resolution would name only two states and the question of name would be
                            up to the countries concerned. The <pb n="45" xml:id="pg_45" facs="0081"/>President suggested that Sir <persName corresp="#p_DSP1">Patrick
                                Dean</persName> and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> work together on this problem and that either
                            through correspondence or the next time the Prime Minister and he were
                            together they take a look at the results. In the meantime we want to
                            avoid a major defeat during the next year. He added that we would of
                            course have to stay arm's length away from any resolutions of the sort
                            we have been discussing. <persName corresp="#p_HLAFD1">Lord
                                Home</persName> felt it was necessary to devise a most ingenious
                            resolution. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName>
                            thought this was not too difficult. It would merely state that two
                            countries have succeeded to the rights of China and automatically they
                            would have the right to be members in the United Nations. This would
                            leave unresolved the Security Council problem. He added he thought there
                            would be enough support for such a resolution. <persName corresp="#p_HLAFD1">Lord Home</persName> thought that if Formosa
                            were dropped from the Security Council such a resolution would get more
                            support. The Secretary thought that later on we could put the interest
                            of others in Security Council membership into the pot for consideration
                            which would help drag out this problem. The President said it would be
                            best from our standpoint if Red China were not admitted this year. He
                            would like to see if we could not address ourselves to a resolution they
                            would not be likely to accept. If they were admitted it would raise
                            incalculable problems for us. Furthermore, from a purely domestic
                            political point of view it did not look good for a new administration to
                            have allowed Chinese Communist admission so soon. The Prime Minister
                            wondered whether a resolution which in effect said that there were many
                            changes and many new members since the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            had started and that therefore a committee should be set up to consider
                            the problem of divided countries and enlargement of the Security
                            Council. The Secretary commented that the latter might help but he
                            doubted the former. The Prime Minister said that Communist China really
                            knows the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> would not support their
                            taking over eight million people. He suggested we should consider first
                            a delaying resolution and secondly a successor nation resolution. The
                            President reiterated we would have to stay way in the background as far
                            as a successor state resolution was concerned. Sir <persName corresp="#p_DSP1">Patrick</persName> added the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> would have to be careful too. The Prime
                            Minister thought it could be farmed out to a neutral.<note n="4" xml:id="d18fn4">

                                indicated that any change in U.S. policy would be particularly
                                difficult if it appeared to be made “because of the eloquence of our

                                would emphasize the complicated nature of the issue. He added that

                                would tend to mute criticism in the British business community.

                            together with copy of translation for Secretary to read. In portion
                            devoted to Chinese Representation letter recalls ROC's role as founding
                            member of United Nations and its record faithful adherence to
                            obligations of charter. From its own standpoint ROC's continued
                            membership in United Nations means preservation its rightful status and
                            its moral position as true representative of Chinese people in community
                            of nations, while from United Nations standpoint ROC's continued
                            presence assures United Nations of Chinese peoples uninterrupted
                            cooperation with other free nations in safe-guarding positions and
                            principles of United Nations charter. Admission of Chinese Communist
                            regime, however, would not only run counter to wishes of people of
                            mainland, but also extinguish their hope of liberation. Letter states
                            further: “My Government cannot possibly accept the so-called
                            ‘two-Chinas’ or any other arrangement that would affect the character of
                            the Republic of China's right of representation in the United Nations …
                            there is no room for patriots and traitors to live together.” Letter
                            expresses gratitude for United States Government's staunch support of
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> in United Nations in past years
                            and sincere hope for continued cooperation in devising ways and means to
                            bar Chinese Communists from United Nations membership.</p>
                        <p>After reiterating some of foregoing arguments orally Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YGKC1">Yeh</persName> put forward <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> proposal that United States and <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> canvass United Nations members see how
                            many oppose and how many favor moratorium and how many reserve their
                            position. Also suggested ascertain how many countries basically oppose
                            entry of Communist China. He suggested next two months be spent in
                            accumulating and analyzing these data, then Governments could meet again
                            and go over whole problem. <persName corresp="#p_YGKC1">Yeh</persName>
                            said he had explained to <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> United
                            States intention to block <pb n="47" xml:id="pg_47" facs="0083"/>Communist China's admission, but he emphasized that any tactic which
                            implied two-Chinas would meet terrific opposition both within ROC and
                            among overseas Chinese. In this connection he stressed <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName>-<persName>Chiang</persName>
                            Joint Communique of October 1958<note n="3" xml:id="d19fn3">Reference is

                            mentioned constitutional problem arising from any situation implying
                            separate mainland.</p>
                        <p>Secretary felt there were two points on which <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> wholly isolated.</p>
                        <p>1—On recognition of <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> as in any sense
                            de facto Government of all China.</p>
                        <p>2—On issue that support of <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> means
                            active support of continuing civil war or regaining mainland.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_YGKC1">Yeh</persName> agreed, but expressed hope
                            that this issue would not be raised. Secretary pointed out people want
                            to know what they are supporting. <persName corresp="#p_YGKC1">Yeh</persName> felt this question answered in Joint Communique of
                            1954 [<hi rend="italic">1958</hi>]. Secretary said implication
                                <persName>Chiang</persName>'s letter was that Chinese Representation
                            question would be dealt with by moratorium formula, which could be
                            decided by a bare majority. If moratorium failed, same bare majority
                            could treat issue as credentials matter and seat Communist China. In
                            reply to Ambassador's comment that if moratorium failed effort could be
                            made treat issue as important question requiring two thirds vote,
                            Secretary said if both <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> and Peiping
                            regime take view that it is only question who sits in China's seat, it
                            would be very hard to argue it is anything but procedural matter.
                                <persName corresp="#p_YGKC1">Yeh</persName> pointed out he was not
                            saying moratorium formula would work, but <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> wanted to wait longer before making definite
                            assessment. <persName corresp="#p_CJH1">Cleveland</persName> suggested
                            that if we wait too long we may go beyond point where still possible get
                            majority for some alternate formula.</p>
                        <p>In reply Secretary's comment he gathered from
                            <persName>Chiang</persName>'s letter there no change in <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>'s attitude toward problem since 1949,
                                <persName corresp="#p_YGKC1">Yeh</persName> replied this correct so
                            far as <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>'s being in United Nations
                            with Peiping regime. However he understood our purpose was not to get
                            Peiping regime into <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> but to block it.
                            Secretary confirmed this as a purpose but said we could not think about
                            it efficiently without knowing <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>'s
                            position. He said there was point of difference in United States and
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> attitudes. <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would rather keep its position as is at
                            risk of losing it. <persName corresp="#p_YGKC1">Yeh</persName> rejoined
                            that it would risk losing it in order to adhere to principles. Secretary
                            said if <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> took risk and lost it would
                            be out of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, but United States would
                            still be there with loss to our position. Thus we had to think
                            separately about our own interests which were different from <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>'s on this point.</p>
                        <pb n="48" xml:id="pg_48" facs="0084"/>
                        <p>Ambassador said <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>'s proposal was to
                            think further on matter and explore possibility another formula which
                            would not mean volte-face for <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>.
                            Perhaps we would be helped by international situation. Secretary said we
                            would have think about problem some more.</p>
                        <p>When <persName corresp="#p_YGKC1">Yeh</persName> asked what British want,
                            Secretary said if issue posed as credentials question (as implied by
                                <persName>Chiang</persName>'s letter) they would have to go along
                            with Peiping. However we are trying think of way of avoiding that issue
                            being posed. <persName corresp="#p_CJH1">Cleveland</persName> said we
                            wanted build majority on simple proposition that <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> should stay in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. This
                            difficult if <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> says there are worse
                            things than being out of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. It probable
                            we could get majority in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> in support of
                            letting Peiping regime stay out because <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> was there thus shifting onus to Peiping.</p>

                        <p>I agree with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MGGC1">McGhee</persName> that in
                            working out our tactics on Chinese representation in the United Nations
                            we should not consider this issue in vacuo but in relation to the other
                            important problems which we face in the area, and that the offshore
                            islands are one of the most important of these. To the extent feasible,
                            it would clearly be desirable to handle the representation issue in a
                            way that will not jeopardize our long-run purpose of disengaging from
                            these islands. For the following reasons, however,<pb n="49" xml:id="pg_49" facs="0085"/> I am not persuaded by the arguments
                            advanced by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MGGC1">McGhee</persName> in this
                            connection on behalf of the successor state formula as opposed to the
                                <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_IO1">IO</gloss>
                            proposal that Communist China be required to apply for United Nations
                            membership as a new state.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MGGC1">McGhee</persName> argues that following
                            the tactical approach proposed by <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss> and
                                <gloss target="#t_IO1">IO</gloss> would mean that we would have to
                            expend our bargaining power with the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            in an effort to gain its cooperation, leaving us little leverage for use
                            in seeking to effect <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> evacuation of
                            the offshore islands. The weakness of this argument, in <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss>'s view, is that we possess very limited
                            practical leverage vis-a-vis the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> on
                            the offshore islands question in any case. President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> has repeatedly made it clear both
                            privately and publicly that he will not abandon this territory, but will
                            defend the islands regardless of United States support. Retention of the
                            islands is a matter integrally related to the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>'s national existence, as it conceives it, and in <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss>'s opinion no inducements we could offer
                            or pressures we might threaten to exert would at this time serve to
                            alter its position.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, in seeking to persuade the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            to adopt a posture in the United Nations necessary to ensure the success
                            of the new state tactic advocated by <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss>
                            and <gloss target="#t_IO1">IO</gloss> we would certainly have to expect
                            to use up some bargaining power, as Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MGGC1">McGhee</persName> points out. The important point, however, is
                            that, assuming we deal with it with understanding, tact, and patience,
                            there is some chance that the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> will
                            in the end be willing to cooperate with us in employing this tactic. On
                            the other hand in <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss>'s judgment, there
                            are definite limits to the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>'s
                            tactical flexibility, and we see virtually no chance of its accepting
                            the successor state formula which envisages automatic seating of
                            Communist China. If faced with the prospect of action embodying such an
                            approach, the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would probably
                            withdraw from the United Nations (at least from the General Assembly),
                            leaving a clear field to Peiping. <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss> can
                            see no bargaining counters available to us that would be sufficient to
                            induce the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> to cooperate with us on
                            the basis of this formula.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MGGC1">McGhee</persName>'s memorandum
                            suggests that the leading role that the United States would have to play
                            in seeking to handle the Chinese representation issue in the tactical
                            manner proposed by <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_IO1">IO</gloss> would create a maximum of domestic
                            political difficulty for the Administration. In my opinion any such
                            difficulty would be mild compared to that involved in adopting the
                            successor state approach. The latter would require the United States at
                            least to acquiesce in the automatic seating of Communist China, which
                            would be certain to evoke strong criticism from a large segment of the
                            American people. Under the <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_IO1">IO</gloss> formula, on the other hand, the United
                            States would be free to maintain its stand that Communist China is not
                            qualified for membership in the United Nations and to oppose its
                            seating.</p>

                        <p>DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: I have received your thoughtful letter of April
                                1,<note n="1" xml:id="d21fn1">See <ref target="#d19fn2">footnote 2,
                                    Document 19</ref>.</note> which was brought to Washington by
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YGKC1">Yeh</persName> following his
                            consultations in Taipei. I am grateful for your kind words of greeting
                            and wish to reciprocate them fully. I appreciate also your careful
                            exposition of the views of the Government of the Republic of China with
                            regard to the problem of Chinese representation in the United Nations
                            and other problems facing the nations of the free world.</p>
                        <p>My government is keenly aware of the expansionist aims of world communism
                            and of the particular threat posed by its sustained efforts to divide
                            the free world. The Republic of China faces most directly the threat of
                            communist aggression. Here the Communists do not conceal their aims, but
                            rather they proclaim their “right” to attack Taiwan. I assure you, Mr.
                            President, that my Government will faithfully adhere to its commitments
                            under the Mutual Defense Treaty between our countries.</p>
                        <p>We are mindful of Communist attempts to manipulate the United Nations so
                            that it may serve as an instrument in their drive for world domination.
                            We will continue to use every opportunity to strengthen the United
                            Nations as the best means of preserving genuine world peace and
                            protecting the independence of small nations.</p>
                        <p>One of our major objectives in the United Nations is the maintenance of
                            the status of the Republic of China as a member of the organization. Our
                            problem is not one of objectives, on which we agree, but rather on the
                            choice of tactics to attain those objectives. We have indicated to
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YGKC1">Yeh</persName>, with whom we are
                            in close consultation, our serious doubt that sufficient support remains
                            to carry the moratorium procedure successfully in the next General
                            Assembly, and are giving urgent consideration to other tactical means of
                            assuring success in attaining our objectives. These exchanges with
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YGKC1">Yeh</persName> have been most
                            useful. We will continue to consult closely with him in the interest of
                            both our countries and of the free world.</p>
                        <p>In the long run, the free world can best meet the challenge of communism
                            by strengthening its democratic institutions and making them <pb n="51" xml:id="pg_51" facs="0087"/>more responsive to the aspirations of
                            the peoples of the world. In this connection, the American people have
                            become increasingly aware of the significant social and economic
                            progress that has been achieved in Taiwan during recent years in spite
                            of the heavy burden imposed by the requirements of defense against
                            Communist aggression. The United States Government has supported these
                            successful endeavors and will continue to do so as free China
                            demonstrates in its accelerated economic growth program that a nation
                            can advance the material welfare of its people while maintaining its
                            great traditions.</p>
                        <p>Please accept my best wishes for continued success in your high office in
                            the service of the Chinese people. My wife joins me in extending
                            greetings to you and Madame <persName>Chiang</persName>.</p>

                                that it should not press its claim by threat or use of force, to
                                express appreciation for the news that one U.S. national imprisoned
                                in China (Robert E. McCann) was to be released, and to state that
                                there was great public concern over the situation of the imprisoned
                                Americans and that their release would improve the atmosphere of the

                                the two countries. (Ibid., 611.93/4-1461)</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> replied his side indeed
                            desired improve relations as he had stated last meeting but it was now
                            three months since new administration had taken office in Washington <pb n="52" xml:id="pg_52" facs="0088"/>and they have seen no signs of
                            any change in US policy. US still occupied Chinese territory Taiwan and
                            its military forces had made nine additional incursions into China's
                            territorial sea and air. If US would only renounce use of force against
                            China and withdraw from Taiwan relations would improve. His government
                            had noted US had been massing military strength in South China; and had

                        <p>I briefly restated US position on Taiwan and denied his allegations
                            concerning Laos pointing out US had encouraged evacuation Chinese
                            irregulars to Taiwan. I then referred to our newsmen proposal at last

                            violating Geneva accords and interfering in Laos. Then restated Chinese
                            Communist position on Taiwan drawing analogy with US civil war. Of
                            correspondents he said US refusal accept their September 6, 1960
                            proposal and attempt after last meeting to shift blame to Peiping proved
                            US unwillingness exchange correspondents and improve relations with his
                            country.</p>
                        <p>I pointed out <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> had glossed
                            over growing Soviet aid to Pathet Lao rebels but suggested our differing
                            views on Laos could probably not be reconciled here and expressed hope
                            peaceful solution would be reached through actions now underway
                            elsewhere. I then presented new draft agreed announcement on newsmen in

                                Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_SC1">Shen</persName> had
                                indicated in a meeting with <persName corresp="#p_DEF1">Drumright</persName> that he believed the United States was
                                moving toward a “two Chinas” policy. <persName corresp="#p_DEF1">Drumright</persName> commented that this feeling would fester
                                until the United States convinced the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> that it had no such intention. He predicted that if
                                such a policy was adopted, the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                                would “try to go it alone” rather than sacrifice its “sacred basic

                                however, Taiwan would fall into Communist hands in a few years. He
                                urged “utmost circumspection” in making any changes in China policy,
                                for “a single misstep could lead to irreparable loss to US as well
                                as <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>.” (Department of State,

                            that acute apprehension amounting to a crisis of confidence is gripping
                            the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Taipei's natural fears about the new Administration have been fed by a
                            series of minor developments (outlined by <gloss target="#t_FONMIN1">FonMin</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SC1">Shen</persName> in above cable, e.g. Outer
                            Mongolia) which, though not intended to spook them prematurely, have, in
                            their highly uncertain frame of mind, apparently had this effect. While
                            such fears may be partly put on, Taipei seems half-convinced we're going
                            to sell it out.</p>
                        <p>This situation creates both an imperative need to reassure
                                <persName>Chiang</persName> and an opportunity (in the process of
                            doing so) to bring some pressure to bear. We cannot afford to let <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> morale drop too far because of our
                            silence; at the same time <persName>Chiang</persName>'s uncertainty
                            should put him in a more receptive mood.</p>
                        <p>Our main thrust must be to convince <persName>Chiang</persName> that we
                            have in no whit altered our determination to support Free China. If
                            possible we should provide tangible evidence by announcing our
                            willingness to underwrite a long-term <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> development plan (in line with new foreign aid
                            approach).</p>
                        <p>But we must also stress the necessity, in terms of our long-term
                            interests and theirs, of rethinking those aspects of our policy which
                            have reached the point of diminishing returns, i.e. <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> membership and the Offshore Islands. We
                            must both face the fact that (unless the ChiComs get so belligerent,
                            e.g. in Laos, as to fix themselves) most Free World countries will no
                            longer support us on these issues.</p>
                        <pb n="54" xml:id="pg_54" facs="0090"/>
                        <p>On <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> membership, if we don't come up with
                            a way to shift the onus to Peiping, a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            majority is liable to vote it in and Taipei out. As to the Offshores,
                            they offer a standing invitation to ChiCom pressure on terms so adverse
                            that we are being compelled to rethink our policy.</p>
                        <p>These harsh realities do not mean that we are playing the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>'s game; we ourselves think that Free
                            China's own interests require that it liquidate those issues on which it
                            will inevitably lose sooner or later, and which divert world attention
                            from Peiping's own aggressive policies. We do not intend to desert
                                <persName>Chiang</persName>, but we feel entitled, as his chief
                            supporter, to insist that he rationalize his position for the long
                            pull.</p>
                        <p>In sum, we had better act to reassure the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> promptly, an opportunity we can also use to put him on
                            notice. Another <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>-<persName>Chiang</persName> letter might
                            suffice, but a VP stop in Taipei if he's going to Saigon might be
                                better.<note n="2" xml:id="d23fn2">Reference is to a projected trip

                            subject of China. According to <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s account, he asked <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> if he wanted the State Department to explore
                            possible changes in China policy, and the two sketched out some options:
                            “Recognize both Chinas, the so-called two-Chinas approach; work quietly
                            behind the scenes for reconciliation between Peking and Taipei; and sit
                            tight and await further developments.”</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> states that he and <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> agreed that “American China
                            policy in the year we took office, indeed for many years, did not
                            reflect Asian realities.” After referring to the problem of Chinese
                            representation, he continues as follows:</p>
                        <pb n="55" xml:id="pg_55" facs="0091"/>
                        <p>“Not surprisingly, <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> ruled
                            out any changes in our China policy. With his razor-thin victory in the
                            November elections—he used to attribute his win to ‘Cook County,
                            Illinois’—he felt he lacked a strong mandate from the American people.
                            Consequently, he was very cautious about selecting issues on which to do
                            battle. And any change in China policy would have been one hell of a
                            battle. In fact, just before <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Dwight
                                Eisenhower</persName> left office, he told <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> that although he would support
                            him on foreign policy in general, he would strongly oppose any attempt
                            by the new administration to recognize Peking and seat mainland China at
                            the United Nations.</p>
                        <p>“Also, such contacts as we had with Peking were not promising. Simply
                            put, the Chinese Communists didn't seem interested in improving
                            U.S.-Chinese relations. As far as <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> was concerned, then, adopting a more realistic
                            China policy became a future task, not a present one. Fearing the issue
                            might divide Congress and the American people, he decided the potential
                            benefits of a more realistic China policy didn't warrant risking a
                            severe political confrontation. He could have been cut to ribbons
                            politically by the China Lobby, the Republicans, and many members of
                            Congress. We would have had great difficulty implementing a two-Chinas

                            and his conclusions, and I told him so. But as I was leaving the Oval
                            Office, he called, ‘And what's more, Mr. Secretary, I don't want to read
                            in the <hi rend="italic">Washington Post</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> that the State Department is thinking about a
                            change in our China policy!’ I went back to the department, and when

                            played the role of the ‘village idiot.’ I didn't tell them about my talk
                            with the president because I would have read about that in the <hi rend="italic">Washington Post</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">New York

                                time to embark upon such a policy, efforts to persuade the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> to accept it would fail and have
                                unfortunate consequences, the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>
                                would not drop its claim to Taiwan, and since <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> hostility to the United States was
                                “an inescapable fact of life” pressures should be increased in order

                                should concentrate our efforts on seeking to insure that neither
                                side resorts to large-scale use of force to realize their
                                objectives.”</note> on the foregoing subject sent to me for
                            review.</p>
                        <p>First, no one can possibly quarrel with the objective of attempting to
                            end the civil war. It represents a very real danger to peace in the area
                            and could well involve us in hostilities not of our own choosing and
                            making. Therefore, I see no reason that we should not continue to strive
                            towards the objective, but I am very doubtful that we should attempt to
                            bring severe pressure on the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> in this
                            regard unless and until we have some reason to believe that Peiping
                            would be responsive. To do so would only produce severe strains on our
                            relationship with the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> without any
                            practical result, for it takes two to end a war.</p>
                        <p>As I mentioned the other day, one of the objectives of my talks with the
                            Chinese Communists which began in Geneva in 1955 was de facto to
                            accomplish the result of ending the war by obtaining from the Chinese
                            Communists a reciprocal renunciation of force in the area. The Chinese
                            Communists were undoubtedly aware that they would at that time have been
                            able considerably to embarrass us by accepting such a proposition, for
                            it was by no means certain that the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            would agree. However, the <pb n="57" xml:id="pg_57" facs="0093"/>Chinese
                            Communists resolutely refused and are still continuing to refuse such a
                            proposition. It is my own feeling that the imperatives of the Chinese
                            revolution and their internal situation render it virtually impossible
                            for them to do so.</p>
                        <p>As I also mentioned the other day, I probed as deeply as I know how on
                            their attitude toward the off-shore islands. Neither at that time, nor I
                            understand subsequently, have they either publicly or privately shown
                            the slightest interest in <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> evacuation
                            of the off-shores but have consistently linked those islands with their
                            whole attitude toward Taiwan. Therefore, however logical and practical
                            it might seem that an evacuation of the off-shores would tend to reduce
                            tensions in the area, Chinese Communist attitudes do not give the
                            slightest indication that this would in fact result. However, the
                            military weakness of the exposed position of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> in the off-shores is obvious and I believe we should
                            continue to urge their evacuation on that ground.</p>
                        <p>I agree with the <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss> memorandum that the
                            very raison d'etre of the present group in the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> is their claim to return to the mainland and,
                            unrealistic though this may be, I do not think we can any more expect
                            them to renounce the principle than we could for West Germany to
                            renounce the principle of German reunification. I fear that this is one
                            of those issues which only time can solve, and more time is needed. In
                            the meanwhile, we continue to do all we can to prevent its exploding
                            into hostilities which involve us. In this connection, the Congressional
                            Resolution on the off-shore islands<note n="3" xml:id="d25fn3">Reference
                                is to the Joint Resolution approved on January 29, 1955, or P.L.

                            authority and is not a commitment on our part.</p>
                        <p>The aspect of our China policy that has most bothered me is that the
                            necessity of defending the position of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> in the United Nations and other international
                            organizations all too often becomes the controlling factor in our
                            decisions and greatly limits our freedom of choice. I would hope that,
                            as our policy on China evolves, we could work out a formula that could
                            much more effectively cope with this aspect.</p>
                        <p>In summary, I certainly see no objection to <gloss target="#t_SP1">S/P</gloss> continuing to explore more fully the practicability of
                            a policy aimed at terminating the Chinese civil war and hopefully, with
                            some fresh thinking, some new ideas can be developed. The formidable
                            difficulties should not deter us from trying.<note n="4" xml:id="d25fn4">

                                <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> letter from President

                            is his usual custom, President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> did not ask for immediate translation of letter.
                            Substance of letter was, however, covered fully by Vice President in
                            subsequent discussions.</p>
                        <p>“I wish to take this opportunity, Mr. President, to reiterate that my
                            Government will continue to stand solidly behind the Mutual Defense
                            Treaty between our two countries in meeting the challenge posed by the
                            Chinese Communists in the Taiwan area. I also wish to assure you that my
                            Government has no intention of recognizing the aggressive and tyrannical
                            communist regime in Peiping. My Government, furthermore, remains opposed
                            to the seating of the Chinese Communist regime in the United Nations
                            and, as I emphasized in my letter of April 17 [<ref target="#d21">Document 21</ref>] to you, regards it as important that the
                            position of the Republic of China in the United Nations should be
                            maintained.” (Department of State, Presidential Correspondence: Lot 66 D
                            204) See the Supplement. The letter was drafted in the Department of
                            State and sent to the White House with a May 8 covering memorandum from

                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> expressed his
                            pleasure over Vice President's visit to Taiwan and stated Vice
                            President's trip has given Asian people great hope. Vice President
                            stated that principal purpose of trip is to make clear firmness of US
                            policy and to gain further understanding of situation in Asia. Vice
                            President pointed out it is very important that United States Government
                            and free Asian governments have accurate information concerning one
                            another's intentions. President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> agreed.</p>
                        <p>Vice President said President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> is man who believes in keeping commitments.

                        <p>Vice President said he wished to make clear US has no intention
                            whatsoever of recognizing Communist China. Policy of present US
                            administration is to love one's friends and to hate one's enemies.</p>

                            found situation in South Vietnam. Vice President replied that he and
                            President Diem had discussed number of positive proposals made in letter
                            from President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> to

                                <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> expressed opinion that
                            as the result of Vice President's visit the situation in South Vietnam
                            may become stabilized. Vice President observed that democratic system
                            frequently makes slow start but then is hard to stop. Totalitarian
                            governments, however, sometimes enjoy early successes. Recent Communist
                            successes in Laos were reason for President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> asking him to make present trip. President had
                            also sent his brother-in-law and sister<note n="5" xml:id="d26fn5">Stephen and Jean <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>
                                <persName corresp="#p_SB1">Smith</persName>.</note> to take look at
                            situation in Asia in which President is intensely interested.</p>
                        <p>Vice President explained that he had been sent on his current mission
                            first to reassure allies who wish to stand up to communism and second to
                            try to strengthen existing programs or to create new programs which will
                            help those allies to do so. By time trip has been completed, Vice
                            President said, he expects President Diem will have sent representative
                            to Washington with additional suggestions designed to increase military
                            strength in South Vietnam. Also, he and members of his party will have
                            greater understanding of the situation in Asia and he is confident
                            program will be evolved that will make possible all out effort resist
                            evil force of communism.</p>
                        <p>Vice President expressed his admiration for excellent job which Vice
                            President Chen had told him is being done on Taiwan. He commented
                            particularly on achievements in education, and on high living standard.
                            He also commented favorably on sincere friendship of Chinese people for
                            United States and on interest of Chinese leaders in development of
                            science. In latter connection, President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> congratulated VP on space flight of Commander
                            Shephard. President expressed skepticism concerning Soviet claims for
                            its space flight. Vice President contrasted full television coverage of
                            Commander Shepard's flight with limited information provided by Russians
                            on their space venture.</p>
                        <pb n="60" xml:id="pg_60" facs="0096"/>
                        <p>Vice President said he believes President will soon recommend to
                            Congress: (1) better coordinated, practical and more useful economic aid
                            programs; (2) considerable increase in strength of United States
                            conventional forces; and (3) all out effort in the space field.</p>
                        <p>Vice President mentioned recent visits of Adenauer and <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> to Washington and coming trip
                            of President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> to confer
                            with President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>. Vice
                            President said that President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> is anxious United States consultations with
                            friendly leaders not be limited to Europe or to either large or small
                            countries. Vice President said that is why he is in Taipei. VP said that
                            US has tried very hard to induce French and British to give greater
                            support to this part of world but that they have been most reluctant to
                            do so. VP said he hoped information obtained and objectives developed on
                            trip would enable US government to be more persuasive with French and
                            British than it has been thus far.</p>
                        <p>Vice President said any new approach to Southeast Asia should involve
                            effort build maximum strength in Vietnam and perhaps also substantial
                            SEATO assistance in Thailand. SEATO members might be asked to make
                            substantially increased contributions. Thus when decision is made
                            concerning Laos, we will know where we are going in Thailand and Vietnam
                            and area will be source of strength. Vice President said since present
                            approach is not working it is very important to find new plan which will
                            stop free world giving up and moving back. President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> commented that this was precisely
                            his own view.</p>
                        <p>In summing up, Vice President said he had tried: (1) to express his
                            appreciation of developments on Taiwan and to state attitude of US
                            toward President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> and his
                            government, toward Chinese Communists, toward issue of recognition of
                            Chinese Communists and toward question of admission of Chinese
                            Communists to United Nations; and (2) to give some ideas on how US is
                            approaching program for Southeast Asia. Vice President said he would
                            like President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName>'s opinion on
                            latter subject. He had no doubt concerning his views on former
                            subjects.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> expressed
                            admiration for Vice President's statement concerning US position and his
                            analysis of situation. President said he wished to speak very frankly as
                            between allies and friends. Vice President encouraged him to do so.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> first thanked US
                            govt and American people for their support which has enabled his
                            government to consolidate Taiwan as base for carrying out fight against
                            communism. President expressed regret time did not permit lengthy
                            exchange of views and said he would state briefly points which he wished
                            to make and would elaborate on them if Vice President wished.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> said his first
                            point is that developments in Laos have proved that SEATO is not much
                            more than empty shell. Reverses in Laos have weakened confidence of
                            Asian members in SEATO and may <pb n="61" xml:id="pg_61" facs="0097"/>also have affected their confidence in American leadership. He agreed
                            with Vice President that something different must be done to save
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>Complaint, President said, is that none of friendly Asian nations
                            concerned will believe that Britain or France can be persuaded to take
                            more positive stand in Southeast Asia. Suspicion exists, he said, that
                            these two countries joined SEATO more to hinder than to help. Free Asian
                            leaders recall colonial record of British and French and cannot believe
                            that they have had change of heart. Also, presence of British and French
                            in SEATO permits Communists to charge that SEATO is merely instrument to
                            perpetuate Western colonial interests. President stated situation in
                            Laos may be charged largely to British and French obstructionism. It is
                            high time, he said, to give up hope that Britain and France will play
                            active role in any anti-Communist alliance in Asia.</p>
                        <p>Turning to another point, President said that, despite United States
                            bilateral security agreements with several Asian nations, united policy
                            under positive leadership is lacking. He expressed hope that US would
                            supply this policy and this leadership. United States, he said, has
                            expended considerable effort in Asia but this effort does not add up to
                            strength it should have produced. General reappraisal of United States
                            policy is required. United States policy in Asia should be based on
                            giving effective aid to nations involved in struggle against communism.
                            President criticized US concept of maintaining fire brigade to rush here
                            and there putting out fires. He said there is no need to supply US
                            forces. Local Asian peoples can do job. President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> also urged that new positive
                            policy in Asia apply to entire area. Effort to solve problems in one
                            country, such as Laos, separately should be discontinued. Vice President
                            asked President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> what US
                            should have done in Laos that it has not done. Madame
                                <persName>Chiang</persName> responded by asking whether it was true
                            that US advisors in Laos had worn civilian clothes, had been responsible
                            for only administrative aspects of aid, and had not been permitted to
                            train Laotian forces. Vice President said she was correct and had put
                            her finger on source of difficulty. Weak spot in Laos, he said, was
                            failure of French to perform their job effectively. Vice President said
                            United States government has made clear to French and other governments
                            that US is concerned with freedom everywhere—not just in some areas. We
                            have told French, he said, that we cannot see why we must argue with
                            them about Laos.</p>
                        <p>Vice President Chen said it is often asked why Pathet Lao can fight and
                            troops of Lao government cannot although both are Laotian. Answer, he
                            said, is very simple. Pathet Lao are supported by Russian airlift,
                            Chinese Communist advisors, and North Vietnamese reinforcements. Lao
                            government is in effect being attacked by several governments. To meet
                            this free world forces must be organized in coordinated <pb n="62" xml:id="pg_62" facs="0098"/>manner. We must have unified planning,
                            execution, and command.</p>
                        <p>Vice President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> asked
                            President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> whether he would
                            favor sending Pakistan, Filipino, and American forces into Thailand or
                            Vietnam as sign we mean business. President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> suggested that, if Thailand were willing, Thai
                            troops be sent into Laos to defend key points along Mekong River such as
                            Vientiane, Luang Prebang, and Tak Hok. US, he said, should give Thais
                            logistical support, supply planes and train Thai pilots. Vice President
                            commented Thais might be interested in this approach if men in US
                            uniform were at their side which was what President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> said US should not do. President
                                <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> agreed and said he has
                            been and still is of opinion that US policy in Asia should not be based
                            on getting US forces involved.</p>
                        <p>Vice President expressed interest in continuing conversation during and
                            after dinner that evening. President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> agreed.</p>

                                collapse on the China Mainland” within 1 or 2 years and urged

                                hasten the overthrow of the Communist regime.”
                                    <persName>Johnson</persName> stressed the importance of taking

                        <p>In the course of discussion of this subject, the Secretary handed the
                            President a talking paper for his prospective conversation with
                                <persName>Henry Luce</persName>.<note n="3" xml:id="d27fn3">Editor
                                and publisher Henry R. Luce. The paper, unsigned and undated, stated
                                that the U.S. objective was to find a proposal that would retain
                                membership for Nationalist China on terms that the Chinese
                                Communists would reject, that this objective could not be explained
                                to the American public without damaging the U.S. case with other
                                governments, and that “Whether the Nationalists can be kept in the
                                    <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> by this means, therefore,
                                depends heavily on the understanding and restraint of leaders of
                                public opinion, particularly those who agree with us that it is
                                extremely important not to damage the prospects of the Government of
                                the Republic of China by acting in such a way as to make inevitable
                                a credentials fight in which the Nationalists could be defeated.”

                            The Secretary recommended that the President discuss the matter with Mr.
                            Luce on the basis of the analysis of the problem contained on Page 1 of
                            the talking paper, and the analysis of the precarious state of the
                            moratorium formula contained in the Annex to the talking paper; but not
                            to get into detail on the “successor nation” or other specific formulas
                            for the handling of parliamentary tactics in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> next fall.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> emphasized
                            the importance of not saying for domestic consumption that the purpose
                            of the exercise is to keep the <pb n="64" xml:id="pg_64" facs="0100"/>Chinese Communists out of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, since
                            that would make any proposal of ours, providing for a procedure whereby
                            the Chinese Communists could under certain conditions take a seat in the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, seem hypocritical.</p>
                        <p>The President asked Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> what he really thought about the matter of
                            Communist China, should we want them in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>? Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> said no, he did not want them in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>; but that this subject should not be one
                            on which the U.S. sustained a major loss, on a question which we had
                            staked the whole of our prestige and leadership.</p>
                        <p>The President emphasized his view that the U.S. should not take the lead
                            in building the coalition for the kind of “two Chinas” formula proposed
                            in the State Department memorandum. He was clear that the Chinese
                            Nationalists are in real danger of being thrown out of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, and that our objective is to keep them
                            in; the Department's proposal seems the best arrangement in the
                            circumstances, but it would require a good discussion with key political
                            figures in the U.S. before the U.S. Government could take the lead in
                            putting it forward internationally.</p>
                        <p>The President said he would ask <persName>Henry Luce</persName> and
                            others whether they have any better ideas about how to keep the
                            Nationalists in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, given the
                            circumstances as described in the analysis of the voting situation on
                            the moratorium. But we could not take the major leadership in promoting
                            even the best formula through diplomatic consultations, without its
                            leaking to the press, and stirring up political controversy in the
                            United States which would adversely affect the foreign aid bill and
                            other objectives of his Administration. While, therefore, informal
                            discussions could proceed in diplomatic channels and with key figures in
                            United States opinion, including President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>, the President's reaction was that the
                            Government cannot bring this subject formally to the surface for a
                            couple of months at least.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary reported that the Australian Ambassador had been in to
                            visit him the previous day,<note n="4" xml:id="d27fn4">A memorandum of
                                the conversation, dated May 23, is in Department of State, Central
                                Files, 303/5-2361.</note> and had volunteered on behalf of his
                            government to take some initiative in this field if we thought that
                            would be helpful. The President's reaction was that it would be useful
                            to discuss the formula we have developed with the Australians and
                            perhaps the British, and see if it could be floated internationally as
                            from them.</p>
                        <p>The President also emphasized the importance of getting the Chinese
                            Nationalists to cooperate as much as possible, since their views and
                            attitudes will be influential with some segments of American opinion on
                            this kind of subject. He suggested that further conversations with the
                            Chinese Ambassadors to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and to
                            Washington might be helpful in <pb n="65" xml:id="pg_65" facs="0101"/>this regard.<note n="5" xml:id="d27fn5">

                        <p>There was some discussion of the Security Council aspects of the China
                            Representation issue; the potential delays and difficulties that might
                            stand in the way of resolving early the matter of the Chinese seat on
                            the Security Council were described by the Secretary. These included the
                            uncertainty of whether a substitution of the Communists for the
                            Nationalists in the Security Council was a vetoable proposition, and the
                            possibility that this whole question would become a part of the larger
                            question of changing the composition of the Security Council, which
                            would require revision of the Charter and ratification by member states,
                            including the United States Senate.</p>
                        <p>The President thought that it would be just as well not to get on the
                            Security Council aspects in the near future; he suggested to Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> that in discussion
                            of Chinese Representation it would be better not to have a well
                            developed position on the Security Council stage, and to discuss the
                            matter for the time being in its General Assembly context. In this
                            connection, he emphasized once again the political dynamite locked up in
                            this issue.</p>

                        <p>Informal discussions among the delegates in New York, and our own formal
                            discussions with the Government of the Republic of China, have somewhat
                            clarified the alternatives open to us on the Chinese representation
                            issue—by narrowing them.</p>
                        <p>It now seems clear that there is potentially a majority vote in the
                            Assembly for two propositions:</p>
                        <p>a. that the Government of the Republic of China should remain a member of
                            the United Nations; and</p>
                        <p>b. that the People's Republic of China should become a member of the
                            United Nations.</p>
                        <p>Our judgment is that we cannot postpone substantive voting on the China
                            question in the General Assembly beyond the 16th session of the General
                            Assembly this fall. The moratorium can no longer be relied upon.</p>
                        <p>It is, further, our judgment that if the Assembly is asked to choose
                            between the Chinese Communists and the Chinese Nationalists as occupants
                            of a single China sent in the Assembly, a majority of the General
                            Assembly would vote to seat the Chinese Communists. Such a vote would,
                            moreover, find a number of important countries, including friends and
                            allies, on the opposite side of the fence from the United States. You
                            will remember that Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_HLAFD1">Lord
                                Home</persName> said as much in the discussions with you on April 5
                            and 6, 1961.<note n="1" xml:id="d28fn1">See <ref target="#d18fn4">Document 18 and footnote 4</ref> thereto. No record has been
                                found of any discussion of China on April 6.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>It seems clear that the best way to avoid having the Chinese Nationalists
                            thrown out of the United Nations in a vote against our position, which
                            might have extremely adverse effects on American public opinion about
                            the United Nations, is to develop some form of “Two Chinas” proposal
                            which can command wide support in the United Nations. To this <pb n="67" xml:id="pg_67" facs="0103"/>end early consultation, well before the
                            opening of the General Assembly on September 19, will be required.</p>
                        <p>Chinese Position</p>
                        <p>We have discussed the problem with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YGKC1">George Yeh</persName> and Ambassador T.F.
                                <persName corresp="#p_TT1">Tsiang</persName>, who represents the
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> at the United Nations.<note n="2" xml:id="d28fn2">See <ref target="#d27fn6">footnote 6, Document
                                    27</ref>.</note> This discussion and reports from Embassy Taipei
                            have made it clear that, in connection with the problem of finding a
                            practical alternative to the moratorium, the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> will not take any action implying acceptance of a “Two
                            Chinas” concept.</p>
                        <p>The “New Member” approach was thoroughly explored with the Chinese
                            Ambassadors. In addition to the difficulties they found with the “Two
                            Chinas” implications, they said this approach was unacceptable on two
                            other grounds. First, the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> could not
                            make any public declaration foregoing its right to use the veto on
                            membership applications. Secondly, the position of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> in the Security Council would be in
                            jeopardy. The “Successor States” approach was also discussed. Although
                            the two Ambassadors made it clear that this proposal was also
                            unacceptable, they indicated that if the majority of the General
                            Assembly voted to accept a resolution based on a “Successor States”
                            approach, they “could do nothing about it.” A “Successor States”
                            approach would not require any affirmative action by the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>. They stated however, that they would
                            be “greatly surprised” if the United States were to sponsor such a
                            resolution.</p>
                        <p>Suggested Solution</p>
                        <p>The attitude of the Republic of China, in our judgment, renders the “New
                            Member” approach politically unfeasible. We have therefore prepared an
                            alternative designed to eliminate the need for any public declaration of
                            agreement or acquiescence by the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> or
                            any affirmative action by it. This is a marriage of the “Successor
                            States” approach and the “New Member” approach.</p>
                        <p>Under this alternative the General Assembly would adopt a resolution: (a)
                            noting the significant political changes which have taken place in China
                            since 1945 and the fact that governmental authority in the territory
                            which was under Chinese administration when China became a member of the
                            United Nations, is now exercised by the Government of the Republic of
                            China with its seat of government in Taipei and by the Central People's
                            Government of the People's Republic of China with its seat of government
                            in Peking, (b) affirming the continuing membership of the Republic of
                            China in the United Nations, and (c) expressing the Assembly's
                            willingness to consider credentials of a delegation of the <pb n="68" xml:id="pg_68" facs="0104"/>
                            <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>, as a member of the United Nations
                            in addition to the Republic of China, upon being informed by the <gloss target="#t_CPG1">CPG</gloss> of the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> that it has accepted the Charter of the United Nations
                            and the obligations of membership. This expression by the Assembly would
                            be based on the proposition that the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>
                            is not to be regarded as a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Member
                            unless it elects to regard itself as already a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Member (in accordance with a decision under Article 55
                            of the Chinese Communist Common Program) and informs the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> that it accepts the Charter and the
                            obligations of membership. We believe that the U.K. could support this
                            proposal, that the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> could tolerate
                            it, that it would find wide support in the General Assembly, and that
                            the Chinese Communists would reject it. This approach should result in
                            the continued exclusion of the Chinese Communists who have been strongly
                            opposed to a “Two Chinas” concept. It should also serve to shift the
                            onus for their exclusion to the Chinese Communists themselves.</p>
                        <p>Securing a reliable majority in support of the above proposal would
                            require active US consultation with many other governments during the
                            next three months. When the resolution came to a vote in the General
                            Assembly, the US could, in theory, vote against or abstain on parts of
                            the resolution or on the whole resolution. However, there are some
                            strong considerations for our voting in favor: voting in favor would
                            make a major contribution to our holding together a large coalition. It
                            would also avoid our appearing to be dissatisfied with the outcome and
                            treating the result as a defeat for the United States. Finally, US
                            strong and open support for the resolution would maximize the chances of
                            Chinese Communist refusal to come into the United Nations. The decision
                            on how we would vote on such a resolution need not be taken at this
                            time.</p>
                        <p>Security Council Problem</p>
                        <p>The foregoing approach leaves open the question of which China should sit
                            in the Security Council. There would undoubtedly be considerable
                            pressure in the General Assembly at the time the membership question was
                            raised to give the seat to the Chinese Communists, but we believe we
                            could avoid any definitive recommendation on this point in the General
                            Assembly resolution on the grounds that the issue is one which should be
                            decided by the Security Council itself if and when there are physically
                            present in the United Nations two claimants for the same permanent
                            seat.</p>
                        <p>However, if the Chinese Communists should agree at some point to take up
                            their seat in the General Assembly on the foregoing basis, it is
                            unlikely that they could be kept out of the Security Council for any
                            extended period of time. That time period could probably be prolonged
                            somewhat by getting this question involved with the question of
                            enlarging the Security Council and proposing the addition of India or
                            other states as permanent members.</p>

                        <p>Recommendations:</p>
                        <p>Taking into account the foregoing analysis and the exploratory discussion
                            held with you on May 24 (summary attached), I request authorization to
                            proceed on the following basis:</p>
                        <p>1. That you approve in principle the proposals for a solution of the
                            China problem in the United Nations along lines outlined above.</p>
                        <p>2. That you authorize consultations on a confidential basis with China,
                            the U.K. and Australia. The purpose of talking with the Chinese would be
                            to seek their acquiescence. The object of consulting with the British is
                            to get their cooperation. As to the Australians, we should seek to have
                            them take the lead at an early date in presenting the proposed course of
                            action “as their own” in private consultations with selected key
                            delegations. In this way, it might be possible for soundings to be taken
                            on the above course of action without the US directly being connected
                            with such a proposal at the outset.</p>
                        <p>Once consultations begin along the above lines, however, press leaks are
                            inevitable. Consultations with a limited number of key Congressional
                            leaders, therefore, should be undertaken at an early stage, preferably
                            in advance of the proposed consultations with the U.K., Australia and
                            China, and certainly before Australia begins its own broad
                            consultations.</p>
                        <p>It is important for us to face realistically the fact that an indefinite
                            deferral of an active US role is dangerous because weeks of hard
                            negotiations and consultations will be needed to develop the stable
                            majority required to avoid the substitution of Communist China for the
                            Republic of China in the United Nations.</p>
                        <p>3. That you authorize us to consult, informally and confidentially, with
                            various other friendly governments who would be influential in
                            determining how the General Assembly deals with this issue, such as
                            Canada, Norway and Japan. As part of the preparation for your
                            conversations with the Japanese Prime Minister, it is important for the
                            Japanese to focus on this problem and the complex procedural issues
                            involved. It is our impression that the Japanese have not yet done
                            so.</p>

                            their interpreters. A memorandum of the conversation by U.S. interpreter
                            Alexander Akalovsky reads in part as follows:</p>
                        <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> then said that he
                            wanted to say a few words about China. At the same time, he wanted to
                            emphasize that he had not been authorized or requested to speak on
                            China's behalf. He said he simply wanted to set forth his thinking on
                            the problem. He said that US relations with China were very aggravated.
                            Obviously they could not be improved until the United States ended the
                            occupation of Taiwan. The most realistic policy would be that of
                            recognizing China and having China admitted as a member of the United
                            Nations. What kind of United Nations is it when it does not have among
                            its members a nation numbering 600 million people? On the other hand, it
                            should be clear that China would never join the United Nations if
                                <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> were to be
                            still there. This would be a discrimination against China's rights.
                            There is no question that at some point China will gather its strength
                            and liberate Taiwan. If the Soviet Union were in China's place, it would
                            probably have attacked Taiwan long time ago. The Soviet Union supports
                            the policy of reunification of China's territory. As a matter of fact,
                            the United States itself signed a document recognizing Taiwan as part of
                            China. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said that
                            he did not know whether the United States was ready for a change in its
                            policy toward China. The relations between <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao
                                Tse-tung</persName> are an internal affair of China, and neither the
                            US nor the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> should interfere. This
                            would be a reasonable course and it would promote a peaceful development
                            of the situation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                            said that he was glad that there were voices in the United States asking
                            for a change in US policy toward China, but said that he did not know
                            how that policy would develop. He reiterated that he had not been
                            requested by the Chinese to speak on their behalf.”</p>
                        <p>After addressing other <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                            statements, <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> replied as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p>“The President said that even before he had assumed office China had made
                            strong attacks against the United States and himself personally, and
                            this has been going on like a drumbeat ever since. At the same time the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> was cordial and expressed the
                            hope that our relations would improve. The President said that he
                            recognized that China was a forceful nation, that its population was one
                            quarter of the world, and that it might still further increase its
                            strength. He also recognized that bad <pb n="71" xml:id="pg_71" facs="0107"/>relations between the United States and China affected
                            world relations in general. However, if the United States were to
                            withdraw from Taiwan, it would have a strategic problem. It would be
                            confined to its shores and its strategic position in Asia would be
                            greatly impaired. This is a problem of security for the United
                            States.”</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> replied that “this was
                            an interesting conception with which he could not agree” and declared
                            that although the Soviet Union sympathized with socialist countries, its
                            policy toward capitalist countries was one of non-interference, and that
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>'s argument regarding
                            Taiwan sounded “strange.”</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> interjected that “the
                            situation should be viewed in the light of Chinese hostility.” <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> replied that “the Chinese
                            cannot reconcile themselves with US bases on Taiwan.” After some remarks
                            about U.S. bases near the Soviet Union, he returned to the subject of
                            China:</p>
                        <p>“Thus, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> continued,
                            the President's argument only fortifies the views of the Chinese. The US
                            will not leave Taiwan and force will have to be used. This is a sad
                            thing indeed. Referring to Chinese statements, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said that the Chinese were
                            against US policy, but then the Soviet Union has also criticized US
                            policy. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said that
                            he had not spoken against the President personally and would not wish to
                            do so. He said he wanted to improve relations between the two countries
                            with the President in the White House, but he may turn out to be wrong.
                            In that event he would have to criticise the President too. The best
                            thing for the United States would be to recognize China because
                            diplomatic relations alone impose certain obligations. The United States
                            could continue to support <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang
                                Kai-shek</persName>, but of course only morally. The Chinese
                            position is correct and the United States should settle its differences
                            with China. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> certainly hopes
                            that this will take place. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> reiterated that if the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> had been in China's shoes, it would
                            have acted long time ago. He again referred to the fight against
                            Americans in the Far East and against the French, the British, and
                            Germans in other areas of Russia during the Civil War. He said that this
                            fight had been carried on until its victorious end and that any country
                            would do the same. Such wars are not aggressive, they are holy
                            wars.”</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> turned to other subjects,
                            but <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> soon renewed the
                            subject of China:</p>
                        <p>“Referring to Taiwan, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> recalled the President's remark that
                            withdrawal of US troops from that area would affect US strategic
                            posture. This, he said, might be true, but what about the Chinese
                            position—how should they regard the occupation of Taiwan? If the United
                            States proceeds from such an assumption, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said, he will be forced to doubt whether the
                            United States really wants peaceful co-existence or is simply seeking a
                            pretext for warlike developments. <pb n="72" xml:id="pg_72" facs="0108"/>The Soviet Union sympathizes with the Chinese and this seems to be the
                            only solution. There is no other way out. After all, the United States
                            might even occupy China and say that this would improve its strategic
                            position. This would be true. But it would be the policy of <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName>, a policy of strength. Times
                            have changed and such policy is doomed to failure. If the US wants to
                            dictate its conditions, that is inconceivable today. No improvement of
                            relations would be possible in such circumstances.” (Department of
                            State, Conference Files: Lot 66 D 110, CF 1901)</p>
                        <p>There was a brief exchange pertaining to China the next morning, when
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>, urging a nuclear
                            test ban, cited “a Chinese proverb saying that a thousand-mile journey
                            begins with one step.” According to Akalovsky's memorandum of
                            conversation,</p>
                        <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> rejoined by saying
                            that the President apparently knew the Chinese very well but that he too
                            knew them quite well. To this the President replied that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> might get to know them even
                            better. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> retorted
                            that he already knew them very well.” (Ibid.) Documentation on the

                        <p>1. We should, without prematurely giving outside indication of our aim or
                            ruling out the possibility that new <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>-Chinese Communist hostilities may sometime become in our

                        <p>The Problem</p>
                        <p>To estimate the prospects for the Government of the Republic of China
                                (<gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>) over the next two or three
                            years, with particular reference to its international position.</p>
                        <p>Conclusions</p>
                        <p>1. The <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> is likely to be faced this
                            year with abandonment or failure of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> moratorium on discussion of the question of Chinese
                            representation. It does not necessarily follow, however, that Peiping
                            would replace the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> or achieve any
                            representation in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> this year. Many
                            countries are moving towards a preference for a two-Chinas formula. Both
                            Taipei and Peiping have rejected such a formula and each has stated that
                            it will not accept dual representation. If any Chinese Communist
                            membership in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> appeared imminent to
                            the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>, the latter would threaten to
                            withdraw. If Communist China achieved membership in both the General
                            Assembly and the Security Council, we believe the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would withdraw from the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. In less drastic cases however, the
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> might not carry out the threat
                            to withdraw, if only to attempt to prevent Peiping's actually filling a
                            proffered seat. (Paras. 12-15, 27)</p>
                        <p>2. The <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>'s principal objective will
                            continue to be to regain control of the mainland. The <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> leaders believe that now is a good time
                            to agitate the question of taking probing actions against the mainland
                            in order <pb n="75" xml:id="pg_75" facs="0111"/>to capitalize on the
                            economic distress and other sources of discontent there. Although we
                            doubt that they would commit forces to such a mission in the face of
                            specific US objections, the possibility cannot be ruled out that they
                            might, without consulting us, undertake airdrops or raids at any time.
                            (Para. 25)</p>
                        <p>3. Most <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> leaders now believe that
                            their best chance of regaining the mainland would come in the wake of a
                            war between the US and Communist China. We believe, however, that there
                            is only a remote chance of their trying to provoke such a war. (Para.
                            23)</p>
                        <p>4. Politically conscious Taiwanese are generally opposed to <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> rule of Taiwan, but inadequate
                            leadership and organization minimize their threat to the regime. <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> security forces are almost certainly
                            more than adequate to cope with any domestic troubles.
                            Mainlander-Taiwanese relations will almost certainly come under
                            increasing strain. (Paras. 30-33)</p>
                        <p>5. With the help of large-scale US aid, the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> has made substantial economic progress, and economic
                            development has acquired momentum. Some negative factors such as growing
                            unemployment, an extremely rapid population growth, and a recent decline
                            in productive investment threaten this trend. Whether sufficient
                            economic growth can be maintained over the long run depends largely on
                            the course of US policy and aid and on the ability and willingness of
                            the leadership to adapt to the requirements of prolonged existence on
                            Taiwan. (Paras. 34-38)</p>
                        <p>6. Over the next few years the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> will
                            probably suffer setbacks, particularly those growing out of the enhanced
                            international position of Peiping. The ability of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> to ride out these next few years will
                            depend largely upon the manner and pace at which the setbacks come and
                            in considerable degree upon the role of the US. We believe that, as long
                            as US economic support and military protection are assured, the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> can survive these setbacks and can
                            adjust, however reluctantly, to a gradual series of changes. (Para.
                            28)</p>
                        <p>7. If the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> leaders were faced with a
                            major change in US policy such as a US decision to use the extreme
                            pressures that would be necessary to force the evacuation of the
                            offshore islands, advocacy of the acceptance of a two-Chinas formula, or
                            formal recognition of Communist China, the bitterness and psychological
                            shock would be profound, whatever guarantees or explanations the US
                            might give. Some mainlanders on Taiwan would seek accommodation with the
                            Communists, or advocate precipitating a war with Communist China, or
                            seek refuge elsewhere in the Free World; however, we believe that most
                            would resign themselves to making the best of a future on Taiwan. The
                            surviving government would probably be less disciplined and more corrupt
                            and less stable than the present one; Communist subversion would
                            probably <pb n="76" xml:id="pg_76" facs="0112"/>become a problem.
                            However, given continued US aid and protection, Taiwan would probably
                            continue as a part of the Free World. (Paras. 39-46)</p>

                            taken in utter disregard of interests of friendly ally. Admission of
                            Liao would be regarded locally as step on part of <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> to promote “two Chinas” and as effort
                            to promote Liao's scheme for an independent Taiwan at cost of <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>. US action to admit Liao was not only
                            incomprehensible but inconsistent with US defense and aid commitments to
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>. Admission of Liao would create
                            confusion and misunderstandings among Chinese people. Liao and other
                            adherents of an independent Taiwan would be encouraged to stir up
                            trouble at cost of stability of Taiwan. Burdens of <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would thus be magnified at time when it
                            imperative that US and <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> stick
                            together in face of growing Communist danger.</p>
                        <p>2. President then raised Outer Mongolian issue.<note n="3" xml:id="d32fn3">The Embassy informed the Foreign Ministry on June 1
                                that the United States was opening talks in Moscow concerning the
                                possible establishment of diplomatic relations with Outer Mongolia.
                                On June 5 Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_SC1">Shen</persName> told <persName corresp="#p_DEF1">Drumright</persName> the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                                considered this a “very unfriendly act” and gave him an aide-memoire
                                urging reversal of the decision. The text of the aide-memoire was
                                transmitted in telegram 767, and the conversation was reported in
                                telegram 768, both dated June 5. (Ibid., 303/6-561) For related
                                documentation, see <ref target="#d198">Documents 198</ref>-<ref target="#d200">200</ref>.</note> He had meant to leave this and
                            their representation issue to Foreign Minister, but introduction of Liao
                            case at this juncture impelled him to express some views on these issues
                            as well. In proposing to establish relations with Outer Mongolia, US was
                            becoming involved in what Chinese regarded as issue of high importance
                            to them. Here again US was proposing to take action portending
                            incalculable consequences to friendly ally without opportunity for
                            advance consultation; advance notification was far from adequate in such
                            an important issue. Establishment of US relations with Outer Mongolia
                            would not only be of tremendous benefit to Communist Bloc but would do
                            irreparable harm to <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> interests.
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> was handling Outer Mongolian and
                            Liao issues in a manner that would not be worthy of a master-satellite
                            relationship, let alone relationship supposed to exist between friendly
                            allies with mutual interests. Continued US ignoring of rights and
                            interests of friendly and loyal ally could produce very serious
                            consequences.</p>
                        <p>3. President raised as third point China representation issue. He said he
                            regarded US proposals advanced thus far for dealing with this issue <pb n="78" xml:id="pg_78" facs="0114"/>as not only ineffectual but as a
                            plan to bring about a “two Chinas” arrangement in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would have no part
                            of such proposals and would withdraw from <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> rather than be party to them. If US adhered to existing
                            proposals, <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would in actual fact be
                            “driven” to leave <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. In President's view
                            US would have to bear responsibility for this action.</p>
                        <p>4. President said Liao development, following in wake of Outer Mongolian
                            and China representation attitudes of US administration, led him to
                            suspect that despite protestations of support, <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> is actually embarked on a calculated change of its
                            China policy. If this should unfortunately be borne out by further
                            unfavorable development of foregoing and other important issues,
                                US-<gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> relations could be seriously
                            prejudiced with unfortunate results to security and other interests of
                            both countries. President said “honor” was most precious quality. It had
                            led him to Taiwan when all was lost on mainland. “Honor” would be his
                            main guideline if he should again be put to crucial test. To this
                            quality he linked “principle, responsibility and integrity.” He would
                            rely on these moral qualities to see him through any crisis.</p>
                        <p>5. President started conversation as if it were to be private, unofficial
                            person-to-person talk, but he ended by requesting that I pass his
                            observations to Department. I assured him I would do so.<note n="4" xml:id="d32fn4">
                                <persName corresp="#p_DEF1">Drumright</persName> reported in
                                despatch 691, June 26, that Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_SC1">Shen</persName> had conveyed “supplementary”
                                views from <persName>Chiang</persName> to him at

                                substance was similar to that transmitted in telegram 824.
                                Subsequently, <persName corresp="#p_DEF1">Drumright</persName> was
                                given Chinese records of the chief points made by
                                    <persName>Chiang</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SC1">Shen</persName>. He enclosed translations of those records with
                                despatch 691, noting that this was an unusual procedure, probably
                                done at <persName>Chiang</persName>'s direction. (Ibid.,

                        </p>
                        <p>6. I made no attempt at a point-by-point rebuttal of President's
                            observations. I did, however, deny his implication of a calculated
                            change in US China policy. I also stated I believed Liao decision had
                            been taken because of outside pressures and was not to be construed as
                            evidence of US support of an independent Taiwan. President clearly was
                            not convinced by my argumentation.</p>
                        <p>7. Comment: President's observations mirror <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> disapproval of US actions in three separate areas.
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> believes US is taking unilateral
                            decisions of great importance to <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> in
                            disregard of <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> interests. Beyond this
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> sees US handling of Laos problem
                            as weak and ineffectual and as probably portending weakening of US
                            determination to defend free Asian nations. Moreover, <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> believes US is not showing required
                            leadership to rally free nations and is in fact waging a losing battle
                            against communism.</p>
                        <pb n="79" xml:id="pg_79" facs="0115"/>
                        <p>Lack of <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> confidence in US firmness and
                            consistency of policy has been growing, although Vice President's visit
                            brought temporary relaxation. <persName>Chiang</persName> touched on
                            three points of immediate concern to <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>. In his mind all add up to “two Chinas” and seating of
                            Chinese Communists in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. Clearly,
                                <persName>Chiang</persName> will leave <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> rather than be forced into “two Chinas” arrangement. It
                            is clear too that <persName>Chiang</persName> will use veto to bar Outer
                            Mongolia from <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> no matter what eventual
                            cost may be to <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Liao case has hardened <persName>Chiang</persName>'s determination and
                            roused deep suspicion of US motivations. Although inherently least
                            important of three issues raised, <persName>Chiang</persName> regards it
                            as of highest personal importance. If Liao is admitted and allowed to
                            engage in anti-<gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> political activity in
                                <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss>, <persName>Chiang</persName>
                            will be convinced it represents <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>-supported conspiracy against him and his regime. Liao's
                            actions could conceivably lead to a virtual suspension of <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>-US relations. Here on Taiwan
                                <persName>Chiang</persName> would almost certainly impose pervasive
                            security measures that would cripple promising social programs in being
                            and probably seriously set back accelerated economic program. Our
                            relations with <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> counterparts would be
                            undermined and our influence diminished or destroyed.</p>
                        <p>If Liao is allowed liberty of political action in <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss> Chinese Communists will seize upon this as golden
                            opportunity to create division between mainlanders and Taiwanese. Liao
                            would be held up of course as US agent. Communists would no doubt
                            redouble hitherto ineffective attempts to influence and subvert
                            Taiwanese.</p>
                        <p>I can only urge from here that we reconsider our position on the points
                            raised by <persName>Chiang</persName> in hope of stopping drift toward
                            breakup of friendly relations and mutual confidence that have hitherto
                            existed. As admission of Liao can only be gained at tremendous cost, I
                            would hope a decision would yet be taken to exclude him. We are also at
                            an impasse over Outer Mongolia's admission to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> by abstention method. On China representation, I believe
                            we should conduct a careful survey of possibility of a successful
                            moratorium jointly with <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> before
                            taking any decision to rule it out. If <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> could be satisfied moratorium would fail, perhaps
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would find it advantageous to
                            adopt some passive tactic that would still keep Chinese Communist from

                            the possibility of your having a quiet discussion with <persName corresp="#p_CYCY1">Chen Yi</persName>. I certainly share your
                            feeling that we should attempt avoid unnecessarily strained personal
                            relations with ChiCom Delegation which might leave us at disadvantage in
                            dealing with ChiComs as compared with attitude of other key Western
                            delegations. Our posture should be polite and correct at all times.
                            Nevertheless, while I believe a discussion between you and <persName corresp="#p_CYCY1">Chen Yi</persName> might be useful at some point
                            in the Conference I rather doubt that it would be of particular benefit

                            be kept secret, since the Chinese Communists might consider it
                            advantageous as a means of increasing their prestige and making us
                            appear weak and anxious, to leak the fact that you had taken the
                            initiative to approach them. The repercussions of our taking the
                            initiative for such a private meeting on our Asian SEATO allies as well
                            as on the governments of the divided Asian countries would be adverse,
                            particularly if there seemed to be no tangible advantage to us from the
                            discussion. The Canadians and French who occupy far less important roles
                            in the Far East than ourselves can hold such meetings with <persName corresp="#p_CYCY1">Chen Yi</persName> without these risks.</p>
                        <p>I would be glad to receive your further thoughts on this matter
                            particularly if developments at the Conference should warrant our taking
                            this significant step.</p>
                        <p>In meanwhile I suggest you and members your delegation gradually adopt a
                            “correct” attitude in and out of Conference toward <persName corresp="#p_CYCY1">Chen Yi</persName> and other members Chinese

                            contacts but also not rebuffing any Chinese Communist initiative.
                            However, if you feel it useful there would be no objection to testing

                                <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> on June 26, 1961. A
                            memorandum of June 27 from <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>
                            enclosed brief memoranda of subjects discussed by <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> after <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s departure. The memorandum of
                            discussion of Chinese representation in the United Nations reads as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p>“The President wants a fresh count on the moratorium together with
                            explanations about Ireland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Upper Volta and
                            Laos. He instructed me to say to the Senate Committee this morning if
                            and when asked that policy of the Administration was to keep the
                            People's Republic of China out, but that we had grave misgivings about
                            whether the moratorium could prevail again.</p>
                        <p>“He instructed me to talk with Cabot Lodge and Mr. Donovan of Harry
                            Luce's office to try to enlist their understanding for a change, if
                            necessary. He has also asked me to see Roy Howard for the same purpose;
                            the approach being to get his advice because he is so friendly with
                                <persName>Chiang</persName>. He also asked me to have a similar talk
                            with Jerry Wadsworth.</p>
                        <p>“I am to let the President know the results following my meetings with
                            Lodge, Donovan and Howard.</p>
                        <p>“He is instructing <persName corresp="#p_DEF1">Drumright</persName> to
                            return at once preparatory to taking a firm position with <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName>.</p>
                        <p>“The President seemed astonished that we could possibly lose on a
                            credentials vote by a simple majority. The President requests a simple
                            memorandum explaining the ‘successor state’ approach to be used as a <pb n="82" xml:id="pg_82" facs="0118"/>talking paper. I understand
                                <gloss target="#t_IO1">IO</gloss> will prepare such a memorandum for
                            him.” (Department of State, Central Files, 304.11/6-2761)</p>
                        <p>A July 3 letter from <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> to
                            the President reported on several matters that they had discussed on
                            June 26. <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> enclosed a
                            memorandum explaining the “successor states” approach and another with
                            the latest USUN estimate of a vote on the moratorium. He reported that
                            he had talked with former Representative at the United Nations and 1960
                            Vice-Presidential candidate Henry Cabot Lodge, editorial director of
                            Time, Incorporated, Hedley W. Donovan, and former president of
                            Scripps-Howard newspapers Roy W. Howard; he stated that Howard had been
                            very cooperative and would try to use his influence on
                                <persName>Chiang</persName> not to veto the admission of
                            Mongolia.</p>
                        <p>He also enclosed a memorandum summarizing Lodge's view that the United
                            States should press for the moratorium again and, if it failed, should
                            introduce a resolution stating that the General Assembly would be
                            willing in the future to consider representation for Communist China
                            when it changed its ways. The memorandum also stated the USUN view that
                            an effort to extend the moratorium for another year would fail,
                            undermining U.S. ability to win support for other important issues, and
                            that following such a defeat, the United States would not be able to
                            obtain a two-thirds majority for a resolution such as Lodge (and,
                            according to <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName>,
                                <persName>Henry Luce</persName>) proposed. <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> concluded the memorandum with
                            an argument for the successor states approach and enclosed a draft
                            resolution. (Ibid., 320/7-361)</p>

                                1 p.m. on June 24. According to notes prepared in <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s office,
                                    <persName>Bundy</persName> told <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> the President “had taken him to task” about the
                                Chinese representation problem, thought <persName corresp="#p_DEF1">Drumright</persName> “should be recalled,” and was wondering if
                                the decision on the Liao visa was made with <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s knowledge. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> stated that the visa decision
                                was his own judgment. <persName>Bundy</persName> said the President
                                “was startled to see all that flap over one man.” <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said there had been nothing in
                                the press, and <persName>Bundy</persName> replied that <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>'s information came from a
                                cable. <persName>Bundy</persName> asked if the President should see

                                    <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> Files: Lot 72 D 192,
                                Telephone Calls)</note> I raised directly with him your question as
                            to the level at which the Liao case had been decided in the Department.
                            He at once told me that he had decided it himself, after long and
                            careful consideration. He weighed the following considerations:</p>
                        <p>(1) That to deny a visa to a political refugee is contrary to our
                            traditions, and to do this because of pressure, even from a friendly
                            government, is still worse.</p>
                        <p>(2) This matter has been pressed urgently with the Department over a long
                            period of time by Senator <persName corresp="#p_FJW1">Fulbright</persName> and others.</p>
                        <p>(3) Liao will not in fact make anything like the amount of noise in the
                            United States that the Chinese claim.</p>
                        <p>(4) The case is not in itself as important to the Chinese as they are now
                            saying, and the fuss on this particular issue will die down.</p>
                        <p>More broadly, the Secretary agrees strongly with you that <persName corresp="#p_DEF1">Drumright</persName> is not representing our point
                            of view effectively. While it has to be borne in mind that his recall at
                            this time will probably confirm the Generalissimo's worst suspicions,
                            the Secretary still agrees with you and is proceeding with plans for his
                            recall for consultation. On the result of this consultation, as I
                            understand it, would hang a decision on his return.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary is planning himself to have a prompt and serious talk with
                            the Chinese Ambassador here, and will let you know what comes of that.
                            He also thinks that we ought to arrange to get either
                                <persName>Chiang</persName>'s son, Ching-kuo, or the Foreign
                            Minister over here promptly, and on that visit he would hope to have
                            your direct and forceful participation.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, the Chinese attitude makes it harder than ever for us to put
                            our weight behind a “successor states” proposal for the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, and as <pb n="84" xml:id="pg_84" facs="0120"/>time passes, the prospect of an effective operation on
                            this line gets weaker. In other words, the Chinese are hard at work
                            creating exactly the situation they should wish to avoid, and that is
                            what the Secretary will tell the Ambassador.</p>

                        <p>1. The Joint Chiefs of Staff have had prepared a strategic analysis of
                            the impact of the acquisition by Communist China of a nuclear
                            capability. A copy of this analysis is attached.<note n="1" xml:id="d36fn1">The analysis, attached as an appendix to the
                                memorandum, is not printed. It estimated that Communist China might
                                test a nuclear device between 1962 and 1964 and, in another 2 years,
                                might have a small stockpile of weapons with aircraft that could
                                reach targets in Asia. It predicted that China would move as rapidly
                                as possible to develop ballistic missiles, but uncertainty about the
                                likelihood of Soviet assistance for such an enterprise caused
                                uncertainty in the estimate of the length of time required. It
                                estimated that without Soviet assistance, China could produce a
                                missile with a range of 200-500 miles by 1968-1970 but could not
                                produce an <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> until well after
                                1970. See the Supplement.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. The Joint Chiefs of Staff conclude that:</p>
                        <p>a. The attainment of a nuclear capability by Communist China will have a
                            marked impact on the security posture of the United States and the Free
                            World, particularly in Asia.</p>
                        <p>b. The United States should use the time that is still available to
                            counter this impact through coordinated political, psychological,
                            economic, and military actions.</p>
                        <p>3. The military impact of this capability will continue to be reflected
                            in appropriate strategic plans. Because of the scope and importance of
                            the problem, the Joint Chiefs of Staff recommend that:</p>
                        <p>a. This analysis be referred to the Department of State for consideration
                            of the nonmilitary points in the required actions.</p>

                        <p>b. A combined State-Defense-Central Intelligence Agency-United States
                            Information Agency Plan be developed to insure that appropriate, timely
                            and coordinated national action is taken with respect to this
                            problem.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> opened saying in two months
                            since last meeting US had not only not taken steps to improve relations
                            with his country but instead seemed to be trying to worsen these
                            relations. Visit of Vice President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> to Taiwan showed the US Government was set upon
                            continuing interfere in Chinese internal affairs and make Taiwan
                            stronghold for conducting anti-Communism in Asia. Furthermore, US planes
                            and ships continued intrude into China's territorial sea and air. If US
                            really wanted to live in amity with China as President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> had said in Paris US must stop
                            interfering in Chinese internal affairs and cease occupying Taiwan.</p>
                        <p>I briefly refuted his allegations and stated our position along lines

                                approach and avoid polemics. Paragraph 2 instructed him to reject
                                    <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName>'s thesis that the
                                essence of the issue between the two sides was the “withdrawal of
                                U.S. forces from Taiwan and the Taiwan Straits,” to remind <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> of the original agenda of the
                                talks, to stress the continuing U.S. concern about American
                                prisoners in China and missing and unaccounted-for servicemen, to
                                assert that the question of renunciation of force was a fundamental
                                one, and to tell <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> that
                                the United States had repeatedly put forward constructive proposals
                                on these and other topics, such as newsmen. (Ibid.,

                                <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> reiterated Taiwan was
                            central issue and since his side was injured party it was up to US to
                            take next step. They had hoped new administration would alter situation
                            but so far no such indication. Regarding newsmen they had studied US
                            proposal but found it unacceptable. Newsmen exchange must be brought
                            about in such manner as to promote solution of problem of withdrawal US
                            forces from Taiwan. He urged acceptance their September 1960

                            accept our latest proposal which differed little from their proposal of

                            efforts had proved futile and they had reached conclusion that only when

                            matters. I told him my government reserved right to make public

                        <p>He began by saying move or gesture by US required for Laos solution. He
                            put particular stress on two points. First, if US withdrew forces and

                            Secondly, he said his side not satisfied with Souvanna Phouma original
                            idea to exclude Boun Oum and Nosavan from Cabinet. Intimated his side
                            willing to have latter two in Cabinet since representation three

                            initiative in proposing informal tete-a-tete probably had its origin in

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> was at pains to adopt

                            constantly to theme that two governments should reconcile views and
                            could do so. He noted his government had often had many critical things

                            our own benefit. He contrasted this with “flattery” of <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Syngman Rhee</persName>,<note n="5" xml:id="d38fn5">Former President of the Republic of Korea.</note>

                            only the U.S. stands between them and disaster, and in which therefore
                            the faintest indication of a change in U.S. attitudes can seem like a
                            matter of life and death. Moreover, they are used to Republicans and

                        <p>They have been deeply shocked by the U.S. position on Outer Mongolia.
                            They were also disturbed by the Liao incident, and of course most of all
                            by the possibility of U.S. support for a two-China position in the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. But according to <persName corresp="#p_CRS1">Cline</persName>, what has particularly troubled
                            them in all three cases is that they did not feel consulted in the
                            process. Our earlier and successful pressure on the matter of Chinese
                            Nationalist forces in Burma bothered them less, <persName corresp="#p_CRS1">Cline</persName> says, because it was handled by
                            private communication—which <persName corresp="#p_CRS1">Cline</persName>
                            himself was our most effective persuader. The Department of State has

                                    <persName>Chiang</persName> of U.S. support but to lay out the

                                withdraw from the United Nations rather than accept a “two Chinas”
                                arrangement. (Department of State, Central Files, 611.93/6-2961 and

                        <p>The net result, according to <persName corresp="#p_CRS1">Cline</persName>
                            is that the Chinese Nationalist Government now feels deeply uneasy about
                            the U.S., and is preparing dangerous adventures of its own, up to and
                            including a suicidal landing on the mainland. Their intransigence on
                            Outer Mongolia, moreover, threatens to make any manageable solution of
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> problem unlikely. The
                            Generalissimo personally cancelled <persName corresp="#p_CC2">Chiang
                                Ching-kuo</persName>'s visit to the U.S., <persName corresp="#p_CRS1">Cline</persName> reports, and if present trends
                            cannot be reversed, he foresees a grievous split.</p>
                        <p>What makes all this so sad is that in fact we have no intention of
                            deserting <persName>Chiang</persName> and every reason to support real
                            progress in Formosa. Yet we seem headed for the same impasse

                            bad political results at home and abroad.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CRS1">Cline</persName> makes the following
                            suggestions:</p>
                        <p>1. The Chinese suspicion is currently directed more at the State
                            Department than at you, and reassurance directly from you can do more to
                            encourage the Generalissimo than any other course. At my invitation he
                            has drafted a possible letter which would move in this direction, and
                            while it would need to be checked closely with <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Dean Rusk</persName>, it seems to me a highly

                        <p>2. Our own interest in a mission in Outer Mongolia is pretty small, and
                                <persName corresp="#p_CRS1">Cline</persName> thinks we could back
                            off from this with no great loss of face. He doubts whether in any case
                            our mission would get any very attractive facilities and he does not see
                            why we need to put a mission in Outer Mongolia <pb n="91" xml:id="pg_91" facs="0127"/>when our real concern is simply not to oppose its
                            admission to the United Nations. He agrees with me, however, that we
                            must try to persuade the Chinese Nationalists not to veto Outer Mongolia
                            admission.</p>
                        <p>3. The Liao visa does not need to be withheld but we can give assurance
                            that Liao will not be treated to any official notice or support.</p>
                        <p>4. On the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> issue, we both think that
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Dean Rusk</persName>'s proposal of a move
                            from the moratorium to a straight debate on the merits has real promise.
                            Even <persName corresp="#p_CRS1">Cline</persName> believes that we could
                            lose such a debate and not bother our Chinese friends very much, because
                            it would be an honest defeat on what they would call an issue of
                            principle. The same thing would hold with respect to domestic
                            opinion—and in any case we might not lose on the merits if the case is
                            strongly made. Opposition on this one is likely to come from <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">ADLAI</persName>.</p>
                        <p>5. A great sustaining dream of the Chinese Nationalists is of course a
                            return to the mainland, and in <persName corresp="#p_CRS1">Cline</persName>'s view we could at once recapture great support
                            from <persName>Chiang</persName> if we would join with him in certain
                            reconnaissance probes on the mainland. This is, of course, a lot to ask
                            of us, although no U.S. troops would be involved, but there is at least
                            a case for a study of this possibility with more sympathy than has yet
                            been given it. I will have more on this after the weekend.</p>
                        <p>In sum, <persName corresp="#p_CRS1">Cline</persName> gives me the strong
                            impression of being a tough, flexible, wholly American observer of this
                            very difficult situation. He will be here until Tuesday<note n="3" xml:id="d39fn3">July 11.</note> if you should want to see him.</p>

                        <p>1. <gloss target="#t_COMUSTDC1">COMUSTDC</gloss> has been studying for
                            several months the problem of what will be the effect on the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> if it appears that acceptance of
                            two-China solution is imminent. He has not been able to coordinate his
                            studies with the Embassy but has discussed the essentials of his concern
                            with the Ambassador. The latter, emphasized the political nature of the
                            problem and indicated that <gloss target="#t_COMUSTDC1">COMUSTDC</gloss>
                            was perhaps out of his field. In our opinions, it is the essence of
                            prudence for <gloss target="#t_COMUSTDC1">COMUSTDC</gloss> to continue
                            to be concerned.</p>
                        <p>2. His study develops 3 possible <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            courses of action:</p>
                        <p>A. Unilateral military action by the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>,</p>
                        <p>B. <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> accommodation with Communist
                            China,</p>
                        <p>C. Negotiation with the U.S. to salvage best possible concessions for
                            mainlander element resident on Taiwan.</p>
                        <p>3. Further study is required before a recommendation can be forwarded.
                            However, it is clear that the U.S. should anticipate <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> actions in case of a two-China decision
                            and should develop our own courses of action to meet future
                            contingencies.</p>
                        <p>4. Ref. A promulgates a statement of United States China policy which
                            presents U.S. policy intentions and lines of action with respect to
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> and Red China. This paper is
                            reassuring. On the other hand, a rash <pb n="93" xml:id="pg_93" facs="0129"/>of stories has appeared in U.S. newspapers reporting
                            that the U.S. is weighing an offer to admit Peiping to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Assembly. We note the difference between
                            policy statement suggested by Senator Goldwater and Mr. Nixon's advice
                            to shoot down unofficial reports that State is considering a change in
                            U.S. policy. Senator Scott<note n="4" xml:id="d40fn4">Senator Hugh Scott
                                of Pennsylvania.</note> has called attention to the fact that some
                            advisers are favoring admission of Red China to the <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> and keeping Nationalist China on the
                            Security Council. These papers add to the Gimo's concern and
                            apprehension.</p>
                        <p>5. Ref. B reports kinds of unilateral military action which might be
                            taken by the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>. We have been observing
                            for many months the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> training
                            programs for dropping large groups of special forces. We are conversant
                            with the development of their plans for utilization of special forces.

                        <p>The Under Secretary chaired the meeting.</p>
                        <p>The paper under consideration was one of July 10, 1961, prepared
                            primarily by <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss>:<gloss target="#t_CA1">CA</gloss> and entitled “Contingency Planning for Possible Renewed

                        <pb n="94" xml:id="pg_94" facs="0130"/>
                        <p>It was brought out in preliminary discussion that the Chinese Communists
                            have the capability of taking the offshore islands, though the military
                            price would probably be high. They could also, at any time, start a
                            renewed crisis which might be intended for other purposes rather than
                            actual capture of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> positions
                            there.</p>
                        <p>There followed considerable discussion of the desirability of bringing
                            about a <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> evacuation, though the paper
                            under consideration is based on the assumption that the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> remains wholly committed to remaining
                            on the islands. The comment was made that, in issues such as this one,
                            US policy revolves around points fixed by our supposed satellites and
                            that recovery of US freedom of decision would impose costs which cannot
                            be fully weighed, but which would undoubtedly be considerable.</p>
                        <p>One participant suggested that, while the paper envisages handling
                            another crisis much like the last, the situation is now different in at
                            least three respects: (1) We have a different President who has made
                            different statements on the subject; (2) there is a different situation
                            in Europe (Berlin), with consequent greater need for solidarity with our
                                (<gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>) allies; and (3) it will not
                            be possible next time to keep the issue out of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Another pointed out in rebuttal: (1) Whatever the President may have said
                            about the offshore islands' evacuation, they are still under <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> occupation; (2) while the greater
                            solidarity needed in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> suggests we
                            press for evacuation of the offshore islands, there is also a different
                            situation in Asia which, it might be argued, operates in the opposite
                            direction; and (3) the paper does envisage our taking a new crisis
                            immediately to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>There was some disagreement on this last matter. One participant agreed
                            we would need to consider taking the issue to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> but pointed to the pitfalls we might encounter in
                            handling it there. Another believed a new offshore crisis could not be
                            kept out of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and that we had best
                            take the initiative in order to have a better chance of controlling the
                            way the issue might be handled. (Still another indicated, after the
                            meeting broke up, that the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> appeared
                            the only suitable vehicle for handling the issue in a non-belligerent
                            context. During the last crisis we agreed to resume Ambassadorial talks,

                        <p>DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: Vice President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> has brought to my attention your thoughtful
                            letter of June ninth,<note n="1" xml:id="d42fn1">In his June 9 letter to
                                    <persName>Johnson</persName>, <persName>Chiang</persName> argued
                                vigorously against the U.S. intention to seek diplomatic ties with
                                Mongolia, declaring that such a move would indicate that the United
                                States was “retreating from principles in the global struggle
                                against world Communism” and would be viewed as paving the way for a
                                “two Chinas” arrangement. (Department of State, Central Files,
                                611.93/6-991)</note> and I have decided to reply directly to you
                            myself because to my distress a number of misunderstandings seem to have
                            arisen recently between our two governments. Our countries plainly have
                            so much in common that it is quite intolerable for us to permit any
                            relationship to exist except the kind of closest cooperation and
                            confidence appropriate between old and trusted friends.</p>
                        <p>It seems to me essential for us to resolve outstanding difficulties
                            promptly and work out together suitable courses of action on the many
                            grave problems confronting us at this time. It would of course be most
                            effective if you could yourself come to see me or if I could go to
                            Taipei. The weight of responsibilities on both of us and, indeed, my
                            schedule of official visits here, make this seem impracticable.
                            Therefore, I urge that you send to Washington a fully trusted
                            representative to speak for yourself and your government in talks with
                            me and other American officials concerning the critical decisions we
                            need to take on strategy and tactics in the United Nations this fall. I
                            had looked forward to seeing your son, General <persName corresp="#p_CC2">Chiang Ching-kuo</persName>, anticipating that he
                            would be able to speak frankly and fully for you on these matters on his
                            projected visit to the United States. I would still be delighted to see
                            him if he can come in the near future, but in any case I urge you to
                            designate someone in whom you repose great confidence to come to see me
                            so that we can have the benefit of your considered views. In all these
                            conversations, of course, we would continue to rely for diplomatic
                            advice and guidance on your competent Ambassador, <persName corresp="#p_YGKC1">George Yeh</persName>, who has represented you
                            most skillfully in exchanges of views to date here in Washington.</p>
                        <pb n="96" xml:id="pg_96" facs="0132"/>
                        <p>My staff has pointed out to me that some concern was caused in Taipei by
                            the announced decision in principle to grant a visa to
                                <persName>Thomas</persName> Liao. Our view was that he could make
                            less propaganda unfavorable to the Republic of China if he visited the
                            United States without any official attention than if we continued to
                            exclude him. It is of course difficult under our political and legal
                            system to deny entry to anyone without very serious cause. In view of
                            your concern, however, we have instructed our Embassy in Tokyo to
                            withhold his visa for the time being<note n="2" xml:id="d42fn2">In
                                telegram 214 to Tokyo, July 22. (Ibid., 793.00/7-2261) A July 14
                                memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">U. Alexis
                                    Johnson</persName> to Legal Adviser <persName corresp="#p_CA1">Abram Chayes</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MCWP1">McConaughy</persName> stated that the President had decided
                                that “for reasons of national policy” Liao should not be given a
                                visa “at this time.” The memorandum stated that Liao should not be
                                told he had been denied a visa but that his application would remain
                                under active consideration; the purpose was to delay granting a visa
                                but to retain flexibility for future action. (Ibid.,
                                793.00/7-1461)</note> and we will not issue it until we have had
                            further talks with you about the best way to handle the matter. I assure
                            you that Liao will receive no official encouragement or attention from
                            the United States Government nor, of course, any sponsorship of his
                            visit.</p>
                        <p>On the issue of Outer Mongolia, I wish to inform you that the United
                            States Government is merely exploring the possibility that some
                            strategic advantage for the Free World might be gained by sending
                            Western diplomatic representatives to this region between Soviet Russia
                            and Mainland China. We are not committed to this line of action and can
                            of course defer United States recognition indefinitely if that seems
                            wise. Actually our main concern is with the United Nations, where our
                            primary need is to avoid letting the Outer Mongolia issue adversely
                            affect the vote on the much more vital matter of Chinese representation
                            in the United Nations. Our hope is that you can find some way to avoid
                            the necessity of your delegation at the United Nations vetoing the entry
                            of Outer Mongolia to the United Nations. We fear the consequences a veto
                            probably would have on the attitude of the African states which
                            unfortunately seem to have acquiesced in the Soviet linkage of the
                            admission of Mauritania and Outer Mongolia. Working out a reasonable
                            position on this complex matter is one of the main tasks that we should
                            set for ourselves if you can send someone to give us the benefit of your
                            ideas on the subject.</p>
                        <p>On the broader problem of Chinese representation, we must promptly reach
                            a meeting of the minds. We have informally explored a variety of
                            schemes, none of them too satisfactory. We are anxious to get the
                            benefit of your judgment on all of the alternatives. We are convinced
                            that, unfortunately, the moratorium will fail if presented again this
                            fall. We should compare detailed notes on this point, but I am afraid
                            this is likely to be the case. We should consider parliamentary tactics
                            to employ that would insure that the issue comes up in the right context
                            and that it <pb n="97" xml:id="pg_97" facs="0133"/>will be considered a
                            substantive rather than a procedural matter. In any case, it is of high
                            importance that your government and mine reach an understanding on the
                            positions most advantageous for us to adopt.</p>
                        <p>I need not remind you that my primary aim is to support the Republic of
                            China in every possible way and to oppose the entry of the Chinese
                            Communists into the United Nations. Vice President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> made these points clear, I
                            know, when he visited you and delivered my letter to you<note n="3" xml:id="d42fn3">Dated May 8; see <ref target="#d26fn3">footnote 3,
                                    Document 26</ref>.</note> a few weeks ago. The key points made
                            in my letter are expressions of the policy of the United States
                            Government and will not change. Our difficulties are in finding ways to
                            carry out those policies in the face of determined enemies and
                            troublemakers. You can help us there by drawing on your long experience
                            in dealing with the Chinese Communists as well as your knowledge of
                            Asian psychology and temperament generally. With a common goal and good
                            understanding we should be able to map a course that will work to the
                            advantage of our two countries.</p>
                        <p>Please let me know your reaction to these views and particularly whether
                            you can send to Washington a plenipotentiary representative or
                            representatives in the near future.<note n="4" xml:id="d42fn4">The

                                the depth of his feeling on Outer Mongolia, and the draft answer is,
                                in my view, an excellent example of how not to deal with the
                                problem.” (<persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> Library,

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>'s July 12 memorandum,
                            attached to the source text, reads in part: “I can think of no letter
                            that would have had a more disastrous effect. It almost appears to be an
                            intended rebuff as it deals with none of the questions that were raised
                            in <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName>'s letter and
                            does not have any substantive expressions of good will, which I believe
                            are rather necessary at this time.”</p>
                        <p>I am replying myself because, although I had not personally seen the text
                            of the draft, its general nature was determined with my knowledge and
                            full concurrence.</p>
                        <p>It does not seem to me appropriate for a Vice President to become deeply
                            involved in the particulars of highly controversial topics which we have
                            outstanding with other governments. These involve the most careful
                            negotiations and discussion, making full use of diplomatic channels and,
                            where necessary, direct communications between foreign ministers or
                            heads of government. In the case of President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName>'s letter to the Vice President, it was
                            my view that the subjects could better be dealt with in detail on the
                            spot by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DEF1">Drumright</persName>, and
                            I personally approved a telegram (#715 of June 30, attached)<note n="2" xml:id="d43fn2">Not attached to the source text; see <ref target="#d39fn1">footnote 1, Document 39</ref>.</note>
                            instructing the Ambassador to discuss the topics raised in the letter to
                            the Vice President prior to the Ambassador's return for consultation. It
                            was also my view that, following <persName corresp="#p_DEF1">Drumright</persName>'s return, a communication from you to
                            President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> would be
                            appropriate.</p>
                        <p>Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MCWP1">McConaughy</persName>
                            discussed the nature of the reply with the Vice President's staff, as
                            well as with the White House staff. It was our understanding that the
                            Vice President preferred to avoid a substantive reply to the
                            Generalissimo.</p>
                        <pb n="99" xml:id="pg_99" facs="0135"/>
                        <p>It was not our intent that the draft reply serve as a rebuff to President
                                <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName>. We had hoped instead
                            to assure him that the questions he raised were being given the most
                            serious attention, a point reinforced by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DEF1">Drumright</persName>'s representations.</p>
                        <p>Although judgments may vary about the precise language proposed in the
                            draft, I believe that it was an appropriate reply under all the
                            circumstances and that the Generalissimo would have considered it
                                so.<note n="3" xml:id="d43fn3">The final letter from

                                    <persName>Chiang</persName> that U.S.-<gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> relations would continue to be governed by the

                        <p>With respect to the China representation issue at the United Nations, the
                            Secretary recommended the “important question” device as <pb n="100" xml:id="pg_100" facs="0136"/>the best tactic to use since it offered
                            us a reasonable chance of getting a clear, blocking one-third. In
                            response to the President's question whether Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> thought this tactic would get
                            us more votes than the moratorium, the Secretary said that Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> thought that it
                            would. He said that any “two Chinas” proposal was unacceptable to the
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The President asked about the usefulness of the Swedish proposal for a
                            commission to study the problem and report back to the 17th United
                            Nations General Assembly.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CJH1">Cleveland</persName> said that the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> was allergic to the Swedish proposal
                            because of its fears about the composition of the commission.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary thought <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> fears were well
                            founded as the Commission would likely recommend some sort of two Chinas
                            solution.</p>
                        <p>The President asked that some variant of the Swedish proposal, acceptable
                            to the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>, be devised. He said that to
                            use only the “important question” device would be too transparent a
                            blocking measure. It was important, he declared, to formulate a more
                            attractive proposal, apparently moving towards a final solution of the
                            China representation issue. Nigeria and certain other countries would be
                            willing to support us on the China representation issue if we presented
                            a proposal offering suitable rationale.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said that, in view of
                            United States interest and the damage to the United Nations that might
                            result, the China representation issue was, on its merits, an important
                            question.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that there are governments who recognize Peiping but
                            do not want Peiping in the United Nations. They would vote against
                            United Nations membership for Peiping if they had a justification to use
                            vis-a-vis Peiping. He thought that the proposal for a commission to
                            study the China representation issue might be more attractive to such
                            countries if the commission were also to look into the problem of the
                            allocation of United Nations seats, not just the problem of the China
                            seat. No one, however, he said, would be fooled by whatever device we
                            used.</p>
                        <p>In reply to the President's question as to what Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> and his USUN colleagues
                            thought about the various proposals, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CJH1">Cleveland</persName> said that they seemed to prefer the “successor
                            state” formula. The President was concerned to have Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName>'s agreement on the proposal
                            to be used as he would have to carry the fight in the United
                            Nations.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CJH1">Cleveland</persName> said that there was
                            also the timing problem; other countries want to know what we will do
                            before they will decide their position. In response to the President's
                            query when the United States proposal should be floated, the Secretary
                            said that it should be deferred until after the talks with Premier
                            Ch'en.</p>
                        <pb n="101" xml:id="pg_101" facs="0137"/>
                        <p>The President said that, as the moratorium was impossible, to fight for
                            it would be the ultimate futility. What we must work on now is the
                            “important question” and what to add to it in order to win.</p>
                        <p>We must also convince the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> the United
                            States and <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> have a common objective:
                            to keep the Chinese Communists out of the United Nations. We want to
                            give away as little as possible of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> position in order to attain our common purpose. The
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> must recognize that there is
                            good faith on both sides and that there is no ambiguity in the United
                            States position. If we were defeated on the China representation issue,
                            it would be almost as bad for the United States as the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>. Some friendly countries like Nigeria,
                            Pakistan and Great Britain say they can't vote with us, and Japan says
                            we can't win. But we can't allow ourselves to be beaten; we must do what
                            we have to in order to win. The <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> will
                            be asked to give up as little as is essential to winning.</p>
                        <p>With respect to Outer Mongolia's United Nations membership application,
                            the President said the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> must not veto
                            the application. He also indicated that United States recognition of
                            Outer Mongolia should be put aside in the interests of victory on the
                            China representation issue.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that we did not want to organize abstentions to defeat
                            the Outer Mongolian membership application although we and the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would abstain. There was the
                            possibility that, in addition to Mauritania, Kuwait and Sierra Leone
                            might also be involved. In any case, if Mauritania was kept out of the
                            United Nations, we would infuriate the Africans and our goose would be
                            cooked.</p>

                        <p>The President said that he wanted to say something about United States
                            policy with regard to China in the United Nations. United States policy
                            is to take every means to prevent the Chinese Communists from entering
                            the United Nations. This is the basis of our policy.</p>
                        <p>If Red China were to gain admission into the United Nations these effects
                            would follow:</p>
                        <p>1. The <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would no longer be a member.
                            This would adversely affect its international position, as well as its
                            bilateral relations with a number of countries who now recognize it.</p>
                        <p>2. It would have a detrimental effect on the attitude of overseas Chinese
                            in Southeast Asia and elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>3. Such a success for the Communists—when we face them in Southeast Asia
                            and Berlin—would give impetus to their prestige at a difficult and
                            important time for us. It would be a very damaging blow to United States
                            prestige and would hurt the United States position in Southeast Asia,
                            Pakistan, Iran and Turkey. So the United States and the <pb n="103" xml:id="pg_103" facs="0139"/>
                            <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> have the same position on this
                            question: to use every means to keep the Chinese Communists out of the
                            United Nations. On this we are in whole agreement.</p>
                        <p>So the matter which concerns us is how to get a majority plus one in
                            order to carry out this policy. We do not want to lose by three or four
                            votes. This is a question that does not involve just the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>; it involves the United States
                            equally.</p>
                        <p>Vice President Ch'en said that while en route to the <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss> he was gratified to learn that the
                            United States Senate had passed a resolution opposing entry of Communist
                            China into the United Nations.<note n="1" xml:id="d45fn1">The Senate
                                adopted S. Con Res. 34 on July 25 by a vote of 76 to 0. The House of
                                Representatives concurred by a vote of 395-0 on August 31. The
                                resolution reaffirmed U.S. support for the Republic of China and
                                opposition to seating the Chinese Communist regime in the United
                                Nations, “so long as that regime persists in defying the principles
                                of the United Nations Charter”. For text, see 75 Stat. 965.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>The President said the problem is to get votes in the United Nations;
                            there is no problem to get votes on this matter in the United States
                            Congress.</p>
                        <p>Vice President Ch'en said that because the United States and the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> are defending one position of common
                            interest it is easier to find means to realize the objective.</p>
                        <p>The President emphasized that this was a matter of vital importance to
                            the United States and the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> and that,
                            given the background of this situation, it would be extremely inimical
                            to United States interests if the Chinese Communists should enter the
                            United Nations.</p>
                        <p>The President said we must be realistic in counting votes in the United
                            Nations. We must be careful not to count votes we don't have. We don't
                            want to be beaten in the United Nations by a few votes. This is a matter
                            that will be won or lost in a very close vote.</p>
                        <p>At 12:30 the conference adjourned for the President's luncheon in honor
                            of Vice President Ch'en.</p>

                        <p>Regarding China representation at the United Nations, the President said
                            that we are in agreement on strategy, that is, on our objective. We now
                            have to decide what tactics would be best to get the necessary majority
                            in the United Nations. Vice President Chen replied that at breakfast
                            with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> there had not
                            been adequate time to arrive at agreement on all points. He hoped to
                            talk further with the Secretary this afternoon.<note n="1" xml:id="d46fn1">A record of the discussion at the breakfast meeting

                        <p>The Secretary said that at the breakfast meeting we had discussed the
                            precarious situation on the moratorium and thought that we might go for
                            the important question. If we would get enough votes to carry this
                            proposal, the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would go along. Some
                            thought was also given to deferring the China seat issue until the
                            problem of reallocating seats in the United Nations and its
                            organizations had been resolved.</p>
                        <p>The President said that what we have to worry about is this year. We
                            don't know what the Chinese Communists may do in the next 12 months. The
                            coming 12 months may present us a different problem and a different
                            solution. Many things may happen—for example, as a result of the dispute
                            between India and China. He said: “Let's win this one.” Next year we may
                            fight them on another basis.</p>

                        <p>The President said that last year Pakistan had not voted against us
                            because of a special plea from President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>. The Pakistanis, however, made clear that
                            last year was the last time they would accede to our request on this
                            matter. Nigeria is friendly to the United States but, in accordance with
                            the general Commonwealth position, it will vote against us this year.
                            Brazil also has had a change of attitude.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that at the breakfast meeting he had explained that
                            the United States position with regard to Outer Mongolia was one of
                            great flexibility and that we were in no rush for bilateral relations
                            with Outer Mongolia. We were much concerned, however, about the effect
                            Outer Mongolia would have on voting in the United Nations.</p>
                        <p>The President said he had read over the 1955 correspondence between the
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> and the US concerning United

                                <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> had replied
                            that, as Outer Mongolia was not an independent state, the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> could not agree to United Nations
                            membership for Outer Mongolia. The interest of the United States now is
                            the effect the Outer Mongolian question will have on votes in the United
                            Nations with respect to China representation. How many votes can we lose
                            or gain from Africa in this regard? As the Secretary has said, we are
                            suspending talks on bilateral relations with Outer Mongolia.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YGKC1">Yeh</persName> said that the last
                            time he was in Taiwan, President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> asked him if United States plans to establish
                            relations with Outer Mongolia were based purely on improving the United
                            States position vis-a-vis the China representation issue—or did the
                            United States have other motives?</p>
                        <p>The President said that these bilateral talks had taken place in order to
                            seek a solution to the deadlock over Mauritania and Outer Mongolia. Last
                            year the United States could not decide if Outer Mongolia was
                            independent. Now we are not going ahead on the question of United
                            States-Outer Mongolia relations because of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>'s feelings regarding Outer Mongolia.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary remarked that the intelligence community felt that we
                            needed more information on remote areas but that this consideration had
                            been a relatively small part of the problem. Perhaps President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName>'s idea was that United States
                            relations with Outer Mongolia was a step toward United States
                            recognition of Peiping. However, it was nothing of the kind. The
                            dominant problem is the fact that the entire African community is
                            terribly troubled over the question of United Nations membership for
                            Mauritania. The Soviet Union's linking Mauritania and Outer Mongolia has
                            involved 10 to 15 votes on China representation.</p>
                        <pb n="106" xml:id="pg_106" facs="0142"/>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TT1">Tsiang</persName> said that the
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would prefer to rely on
                            abstentions to keep Mauritania out of the United Nations rather than to
                            use the veto. In any event, some African states would feel that we were
                            ganging up on Mauritania if the abstentions device was used.
                            Nonetheless, there is a difference in abstaining and in vetoing, but it
                            is impossible to express this difference in number of votes. He had
                            advised his government not to veto the Mauritanian United Nations
                            application but to use the abstention method.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> said the
                            question is: what will be the effect on the Africans of a group of
                            abstentions?</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TT1">Tsiang</persName> said that in May
                            1961 he was in Taipei. It was unfortunate then that the question of
                            United States recognition of Outer Mongolia had generated suspicions on
                            Taiwan and had stiffened the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            attitude against United States recognition of Outer Mongolia. The United
                            States attitude on Asia appears different from its attitude on Europe.
                            In the latter case, it says “thus far and no further,” but in Asia it
                            seems prepared to retreat still more.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> replied that
                            since 1945 we had fought in Asia but not in Europe.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TT1">Tsiang</persName> asked whether the
                            United States could adopt an attitude toward Outer Mongolia such as it
                            had adopted toward the Baltic states.</p>
                        <p>The President said that we have suspended our bilateral talks with Outer
                            Mongolia.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TT1">Tsiang</persName> asked if the
                            United States could go further than merely suspending the
                            negotiations.</p>
                        <p>The President said it would be best to let these negotiations on Outer
                            Mongolia die out during the Berlin situation.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TT1">Tsiang</persName> asked, if the
                            United States could not make a public statement about Outer Mongolia,
                            could the United States assure the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            that the United States policy is the same towards Outer Mongolia as
                            toward the Baltic states.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that the United States would have to think about
                            that.</p>
                        <p>The President said that we accepted the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> views on the non-independence of Outer Mongolia and we
                            will not continue our negotiations with it. The question is what should
                            we do about Outer Mongolia in the United Nations?</p>
                        <p>Vice President Chen said that he was fully aware of the relationship
                            between the Outer Mongolia question and China representation at the
                            United Nations. He had discussed this with President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> and the Cabinet more than once.
                            The <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> is governed by one overriding
                            consideration in its relationship with the United States. The <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> does not want <pb n="107" xml:id="pg_107" facs="0143"/>to add to United States difficulties or
                            see United States prestige suffer. The <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> has no suspicion of wicked motives on the part of the
                            United States. However, each country has its own difficulties and
                            historical background. He would like to explain the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> position on Outer Mongolia. The <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> is not dominated by emotions. It has
                            objectively considered the problem and taken considerable regard for
                            internal repercussions in the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DEF1">Drumright</persName> in Taipei
                            had been kept fully informed of the Chinese attitude and in Washington
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YGKC1">Yeh</persName> had been kept
                            fully informed so that he could convey <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> views to the United States Government.</p>
                        <p>Outer Mongolia is clearly one of the Soviet Union's creations. The Asian
                            countries recognize this and the United States at the United Nations had
                            declared Outer Mongolia did not have the attributes of a sovereign
                            state. The <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> feels United States
                            recognition of Outer Mongolia would greatly add to Soviet and Communist
                            world prestige. The <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> is concerned
                            about the effect of this on its compatriots on the China mainland and
                            other peoples behind the iron curtain. The United States, as the leader
                            of the free world, should consider whether any of its actions would add
                            to the prestige of the Soviet Union and the Communist world. Internally,
                            the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>'s people are pledged to a policy
                            of fighting Communism and countering Russia. This policy was formulated
                            by the Kuomintang, adopted by the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            government and endorsed by the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            legislative branch. The <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>'s feeling in
                            this regard is shared by a number of Asian countries.</p>
                        <p>Vice President Chen said he believes he can control his own cabinet.
                            However, just before his departure from Taipei for Washington, a meeting
                            was held of representatives of the five Yuans. At this joint conference
                            the Vice President represented the Executive Yuan and heard the
                            unanimous views on Outer Mongolia of the representatives of the other
                            four Yuans. Their united view was that the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> must use all means under the United Nations Charter to
                            block Outer Mongolia's entry into the United Nations.</p>
                        <p>The President said that Vice President Chen, as a military man, should
                            know that it is easy to send instructions to the field but at the
                            General Assembly the ambassadors of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> and the United States would have to carry the fight on
                            China representation. In the United States there had been Congressional
                            resolutions on keeping the Chinese Communists, as well as Outer
                            Mongolia, out of the United Nations. The real question was how to do
                            this.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that United States and <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> policies towards Africa are important. He had been
                            impressed by the progress the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> had
                            made in Africa. The African bloc in the United Nations is as important
                            now as the Latin American bloc. <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            relationships with the African <pb n="108" xml:id="pg_108" facs="0144"/>states can greatly strengthen its position in the United Nations. The
                            United States has a great stake in Africa.</p>
                        <p>The President said that, in seeking to keep the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> in the United Nations and Outer Mongolia out, we must
                            recognize the close relationship between the United Nations membership
                            applications of Outer Mongolia and Mauritania. In this regard he said,
                            “You can't have everything.”</p>
                        <p>Some people on Taiwan may think that United States recognition of Outer
                            Mongolia is a backhanded way of recognizing Peiping. This is not true.
                            The only concern of the United States is to win on Chinese
                            representation in the United Nations—to get the majority of votes on
                            this question. We can't let those who don't understand this situation
                            direct our strategy or we will end up beaten, the President said.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked Vice President Chen if it wouldn't be better to have
                            Outer Mongolia than Communist China in the United Nations.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YGKC1">Yeh</persName> said that we
                            wouldn't want either. He offered assurance that none of the Chinese
                            present had any sneaking suspicions of the United States. Otherwise,
                            Vice President Chen wouldn't have come to Washington.</p>
                        <p>Vice President Chen said with reference to President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>'s statement about <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> misunderstanding of United States
                            motives that, if he had ever had any suspicions, these suspicions had
                            been completely dissipated after the talks with President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>. He knows President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> is dealing with vast world
                            problems, and he doesn't want to waste President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>'s time. Therefore, he suggests
                            that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, Foreign
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_SC1">Shen</persName> and other United
                            States and <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> officials work out the
                            technical details. He prefers the Outer Mongolian problem to be handled
                            at this level.</p>
                        <p>Vice President Chen said that, in the continuing struggle between
                            Communism and freedom, the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> does not
                            want to help the Communist world. It is important for the free world to
                            achieve greater solidarity and stronger organization in facing Communist
                            bloc. What is needed is a permanent staff set-up among the free
                            countries of Asia. The <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> has drawn up
                            a plan toward this end. As soon as the document is translated into
                            English, the Secretary will be given a copy.<note n="3" xml:id="d46fn3">The text of the proposal, “An Outline Proposal for a Collective
                                Security Organization of the Anti-Communist Countries in the Western
                                Pacific Area,” codenamed Taiping, was enclosed with instruction
                                CW-1777 to <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> and five
                                Embassies, August 25. (Department of State, Central Files,
                                790.5/8-2561) A November 21 memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_MCWP1">McConaughy</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> recommended against the
                                proposal. (Ibid., 790.5/11-2161) <persName corresp="#p_SJM1">Steeves</persName> informed Minister Kiang on December 19 that
                                the United States considered that the objectives of the Chinese
                                proposal could best be gained through existing liaison machinery.
                                (Ibid., 790.5/12-1961)</note> The organization proposed would do
                            much to solidify and unify anti-Communist forces in <pb n="109" xml:id="pg_109" facs="0145"/>Asia. If this plan could be adopted as
                            soon as possible it would relieve the United States of some worries.
                            This plan will not lead to requests from the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> for more money. It is conceived in the interest of the
                            United States and the free world.</p>
                        <p>The President said that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> would look at this proposal after it had been given
                            to him in English translation.</p>
                        <p>It was an extremely difficult task to maintain understanding among all
                            United States allies such as India and Pakistan or France and Tunisia,
                            the President observed.</p>
                        <p>The President emphasized that the United States and the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> must be sure to have the best possible
                            intelligence on China mainland conditions.</p>
                        <p>Vice President Chen said he fully shared the President's anxiety about
                            having accurate information on mainland conditions. In this connection,
                            he had brought some materials concerning political, social, economic and
                            military conditions on the mainland, but these materials have yet to be
                            translated. The <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> still keeps in touch
                            with its people on the mainland and gets information from them.</p>
                        <p>The President referred to the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> concern
                            over issuance of a United States visa to <persName>Thomas</persName>
                            Liao and suggested that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> could discuss this later with the Chinese
                            representative.</p>
                        <p>Vice President Chen said that Liao was a nonentity and that he did not
                            attach much importance to the Liao case. However, in Taiwan some people
                            had the impression the Americans wanted to bring him to the United
                            States and build him up.</p>
                        <p>The President said that we don't want to make Liao important. In fact,
                            scarcely anyone in the United States had heard of him.</p>
                        <p>Vice President Chen assured the President that the Liao case was no
                            problem.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that at present possibly 500 people in the United
                            States had heard of Liao. However, if the human rights issue were raised
                            in his case, 100 million Americans might hear of him.</p>
                        <p>The President mentioned that Senator <persName corresp="#p_FJW1">Fulbright</persName> was interested in the Liao visa case.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YGKC1">Yeh</persName> said that Liao had
                            taken Senator <persName corresp="#p_FJW1">Fulbright</persName>'s reply
                            to him and had mimeographed copies made for distribution to Liao
                            sympathizers in Japan.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that we are agreed on the basic relationships between
                            the United States and the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>, notably
                            as set forth in the Mutual Defense Treaty of 1954 and the accompanying
                            exchange of notes on the use of force by agreement only.</p>
                        <pb n="110" xml:id="pg_110" facs="0146"/>
                        <p>The President said that close consultation between our two governments on
                            any actions that may bring on a military response is also most
                            important.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YGKC1">Yeh</persName> said that the
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> agreed. It was in this
                            connection that the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> had suggested
                            joint staff meetings.</p>
                        <p>The President said that we must be careful not to get involved in actions
                            on the China mainland which are based on hope and not facts. Therefore
                            we need reliable information.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YGKC1">Yeh</persName> said the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> had “never acted contrary to the Treaty
                            and never intends to.”</p>
                        <p>Vice President Chen assured the President that “China's word is gold.” He
                            said that “we don't go back on our word.” The Vice President reiterated
                            that our common struggle with Communism will be long, and so we must
                            stick together. We must look at these problems in the same spirit.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> does not intend to suggest the
                            replacement of SEATO but rather to make it more effective by including
                            anti-Communist countries who have forces to fight Communist aggression.
                            Both the United States and <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> are
                            working on parallel lines, such as in intelligence work on the China
                            mainland. They should pool their efforts with those of other Asian
                            countries. The two countries should use psychological warfare as a
                            substitute for military action. The <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            is seeking to strengthen its psychological warfare.</p>
                        <p>Vice President Chen said that, as a result of his work in Youth
                            organizations on the China mainland many years ago, there were 30,000
                            potential agents on the China mainland who were loyal to him. They were
                            lying low for the time being but would respond when the time came for
                            action.</p>
                        <p>The President asked what method of communication the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> had with the underground. The Vice
                            President said that small radio sets had been used, but this method had
                            been stopped recently. The best way now was for these agents to send
                            messages back to Taipei through Macao and Hong Kong. The Vice President
                            said that the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> cannot rely completely
                            on these agents on the mainland in the absence of an over-all
                            organization. The <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> tactic vis-a-vis
                            the Communists is to counter organization with organization.</p>
                        <p>Vice President Chen said that his faith in his mainland compatriots'
                            eventual liberation had never been shaken because of his communication
                            with them. His faith was not based on mere hope but on his continuing
                            relationships with these mainland units.</p>

                        <p>On August 2, 1961, President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> attended a dinner given by Vice President Ch'en
                            in his honor at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington. Three memoranda of
                            conversation drafted by interpreter Calvin Mehlert, all dated August 2,
                            record aspects of the conversation. According to one, <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> requested that Ch'en take the
                            following message to President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName>:</p>
                        <p>“The United States Government wishes to do its utmost to maintain the
                            position of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> at the September
                            General Assembly and to prevent the seating of Communist China. The
                            United States must not be defeated in the United Nations on this issue.
                            No matter what differences may arise between the United States
                            Government and the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> on the best means
                            to be used at the United Nations to avoid a defeat on the Chinese
                            representation issue, it should be remembered that on fundamental
                            questions the United States Government and the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> are united.”</p>
                        <p> Ch'en replied that the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> did not wish
                            to see the prestige of the United States damaged and would take no steps
                            that might result in injury to the U.S. position. (<persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> Library, National Security

                        <p>A second memorandum of conversation records conversation between
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> and Ch'en concerning
                            various topics, including a question from <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> to Ch'en whether the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> armed forces were not becoming over-age; Ch'en replied
                            that the problem had been solved by conscription and that the average
                            age was 25. A third memorandum records some discussion between <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> and Mehlert in which the
                            President inquired about the attitude of the Chinese Communists at
                            Geneva and in the Warsaw talks. (Ibid.)</p>

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> gave his
                            opinion that these propositions would not be sufficient, and that
                            something like the successor state idea should also be in the
                            picture.</p>
                        <p>The President said he realized the committee or any other means of
                            postponement might only lead in time—next year, perhaps—to a Two-China
                            proposal or even to ChiCom admission in some form. But he wanted to
                            avoid taking any major step along this road this year. He also was
                            determined that the United States was not to be defeated on this issue
                            in the United Nations. Based on discussions with Chen Cheng this past
                            week, the President fears that <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang

                            us in the process. Nevertheless, we had to keep on trying to persuade
                            him that in the interest of protecting his <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> seat (a national interest of the U.S. as well as of the

                            be required as we went along. One notable adjustment is the non-use of

                        <p>The Problem</p>
                        <p>To assess the cohesion of the Sino-Soviet Bloc and among the parties of
                            the world Communist movement, to identify trends in the degree of Soviet
                            control, and to estimate the future implication of these trends.</p>
                        <p>Summary and Conclusions</p>
                        <p>General Considerations</p>
                        <p>1. According to Communist doctrine, it would be impossible for conflicts
                            of interest to disturb in any basic way the relations between Communist
                            parties in the international movement. This is so, it is argued, because
                            the class interests which are the source of international conflict among
                            non-Communist states have been suppressed by the new social order, and
                            have been replaced by the fundamental identity of views and harmony of
                            interests of the “classless” society. In fact, however, the appearance
                            of unity in the Communist movement has been due, not so much to the
                            absence of conflicts of interest, as to the overwhelming authority
                            exercised by Moscow. This authority has rested on the great military and
                            economic power of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, on its
                            historical precedence as the first Communist state, on the long personal
                            ascendancy of Stalin over the international Communist movement, and on
                            the tradition of dictatorial centralism in that movement. (Paras.
                            13-18)</p>
                        <p>2. In the period since World War II a number of developments have
                            demonstrated the falsity of the simplistic Communist theory of natural
                            harmony among Communist parties. When the Communist parties of Eastern
                            Europe achieved state power they naturally acquired new interests and
                            attitudes different from those they had reflected as small
                            conspiratorial groups wholly dependent on the protection and support
                            provided by Moscow. Yet they were small states in Moscow's immediate
                            sphere of power; therefore, whatever pretensions to independence they
                                <pb n="115" xml:id="pg_115" facs="0151"/>may have had were bound to
                            be extremely circumscribed. The achievement of state power by the
                            Chinese Communists was a different matter, however, because it meant
                            that for the first time Communist theory on state relations had to be
                            applied to the relations between two great powers. (Paras. 14-16)</p>
                        <p>3. Beyond this, there was in the postwar period a considerable growth in
                            the number and in the size of Communist parties all over the world.
                            Among them there were wide variations in the cultural and political
                            environments in which they operated, in their tactical problems, and in
                            the degree of their Marxist-Leninist sophistication and training. Over
                            the years, moreover, there has been a tendency for a number of the more
                            important non-Bloc parties to be increasingly concerned to see that
                            their own local points of view are considered in policy deliberations of
                            the international movement. (Paras. 14, 39-40)</p>
                        <p>4. All these developments have tested not only the theory of unity, but
                            also the authority of the Soviet Party over other parties which was the
                            practical reality on which the appearance of unity was built. In the
                            best of circumstances it was bound to become increasingly difficult for
                            Moscow to maintain the unity of so large and varied a movement with so
                            wide a range of differing views and interests. In addition, these events
                            have aggravated the frequent conflicts between the requirements of the
                            foreign policy of the Soviet state and those of the international
                            Communist movement. Altogether, it is evident that Communist political
                            institutions, like all other institutions, are subject to pressures for
                            change and are in fact changing. (Paras. 13-21, 34-40, 59)</p>
                        <p>Disciplinary Problems in the Communist Movement</p>
                        <p>5. Stalin's authority over the international Communist movement was
                            tested almost as soon as the new Communist states came into existence at
                            the end of World War II. Challenged by Yugoslavia in 1948, he failed
                            either to impose discipline or to prevent Yugoslavia's subsequent
                            survival as an independent Communist state. When the Chinese Communists
                            achieved state power in 1949—like the Yugoslavs, largely by their own
                            efforts—they inevitably acquired a special status in the Bloc. After
                            Stalin died and his awesome aura of personal authority over the parties
                            disappeared, his less eminent successors attempted to overcome the
                            abuses of his brutal and open control by substituting a more flexibly
                            exercised but still decisive influence. These experiments were cut
                            short, however, by the Eastern European upheavals of 1956, which showed
                            that the balance between influence and outright control would be a
                            difficult one to strike. (Paras. 13-15, 19-21)</p>
                        <p>6. Since 1956, when Peiping helped Moscow to restore its badly shaken
                            authority in Eastern Europe, China has become an increasingly important
                            factor in the direction of the movement, and has developed pretensions
                            as an authoritative source of Communist doctrine. When the <pb n="116" xml:id="pg_116" facs="0152"/>Chinese leaders resorted in 1960 to
                            open politics in their policy disagreements with Moscow, and also
                            lobbied openly among Communists against Soviet policies, the Soviets
                            responded by, in effect, putting the Chinese on trial before the other
                            parties, first at Bucharest and later at the November conference in
                            Moscow. Nevertheless, during the Sino-Soviet dispute of 1960 the Chinese
                            were able to bring a successful challenge to Soviet authority and to
                            establish the formal principle of mandatory consultation among the
                            parties on matters of general Communist policy. (Paras. 16, 21-28)</p>
                        <p>Prospects for Soviet Authority</p>
                        <p>7. Since the 81-party conference of November 1960, the Soviets and the
                            Chinese have continued, within limits, their separate efforts to
                            preserve and expand their own authority in the movement. It seems to us
                            unlikely that the two major parties will be able for some time to come
                            to resolve their differences and achieve a stable arrangement for
                            directing the Communist movement. On the other hand, an open rupture
                            between them appears to us equally unlikely. We believe that the course
                            of their relations will be erratic, cooperative at some times and
                            places, competitive at others. (Paras. 35, 38, 59-62)</p>
                        <p>8. In this situation the Soviet Party possesses enormous advantages,
                            because of its greater military and economic power, and also because of
                            its traditional authority and prestige within the movement. The ability
                            of the Chinese Party to contend for leadership is currently limited by
                            China's serious internal difficulties. The Soviets retain some
                            opportunity to exert pressure by virtue of China's relative economic and
                            military weakness, though this apparently was not very effective in the
                            dispute of 1960. Because of the present preponderance of Soviet power,
                            Moscow will probably be able, though with increasing difficulty, to
                            maintain its primacy in the Communist movement for some time to come.
                            The Soviet leaders will endeavor to maintain the substance of their
                            former authority by exercising pressure and influence bilaterally upon
                            other parties, by confronting their rivals with strong majority
                            coalitions at international gatherings, and sometimes by shrewd
                            adjustments of Soviet policies in order to undercut Chinese criticisms.
                            Because the role of personalities has figured in some degree in the
                            Soviet-Chinese difficulties, the appearance of new leaders in either
                            country could have an important influence on the further course of their
                            relations. (Paras. 60-62)</p>
                        <p>9. In these circumstances, the other parties will almost inevitably be
                            tempted to bargain between Moscow and Peiping in order to obtain greater
                            advantages for themselves. Within certain parties which develop serious
                            prospects of achieving power, and which therefore must make important
                            tactical choices, conflicting brands of advice may tend to intensify
                            factionalism. In the long run, some of the parties in Eastern <pb n="117" xml:id="pg_117" facs="0153"/>Europe, or factions within
                            them, may attempt to develop further the autonomy conceded by Stalin's
                            successors. In the Asian satellites, where Chinese influence is already
                            strong and has a good prospect of increasing if China's power continues
                            to grow, the regimes will be better able to bargain with both Communist
                            great powers for economic and political support. (Para. 63)</p>
                        <p>Implications for Policy Toward the West</p>
                        <p>10. It is evident that the international Communist system, for decades
                            little more than an instrumentality of Soviet policy, is being changed,
                            because of the forces of nationalism and diversity within it, into a
                            movement reflecting an appreciable diffusion of power. While the altered
                            relationships within the Communist movement and the decline in Soviet
                            authority have not altered the fundamental hostility of the Communists
                            toward the non-Communist world, we believe that these developments are
                            having an important influence on Communist policy. They have already
                            diminished to some extent the flexibility of Soviet policy towards the
                            West, and the Soviet Party will probably encounter increasing
                            difficulties in its efforts to coordinate general Communist policy.
                            These difficulties may not be as serious in times when events generally
                            favor Communist interests, but they may again erupt into open polemic
                            during periods of adversity, or even at times when fundamental decisions
                            are required for the exploitation of unfolding opportunities. (Paras.
                            59, 65)</p>
                        <p>11. The development of the relationship between the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and China, and the evolution of the
                            international Communist movement generally, will obviously be of
                            profound significance for the security and interests of the West. In the
                            long run Chinese power, assertiveness, and self-interest might increase
                            so far as greatly to impair the common policy with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, and even lead the Soviets to believe
                            that they had more in common with the ideological enemy than they have
                            today. For some time to come, however, the most likely prospect is that
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and China will maintain their
                            relationship in something like its present form. It will be an alliance
                            which is from time to time troubled and inharmonious, but which
                            nevertheless preserves sufficient unity to act in concert against the
                            West, especially in times of major challenge. However, present trends as
                            described in this paper point to an increasing complexity, diversity,
                            and interplay of forces within the Communist system, and to a remarkable
                            survival of old-fashioned impulses of nationalism. (Para. 67)</p>
                        <p>12. These trends may have various effects. They may from time to time
                            result in more aggressive anti-Western policies intended to hold the
                            forces of disunity in check. They may enable certain parties, free from
                            the restrictions of a rigid, general Communist line, to pursue more
                            effective policies in local situations. But eventually, if such trends
                            persist, they may considerably diminish the effectiveness of the
                            Communist movement <pb n="118" xml:id="pg_118" facs="0154"/>as a whole.
                            This would give the West opportunities for maneuver and influence which
                            could provide important advantages in the world struggle. (Para. 68)</p>

                            state that you are returning to Washington for Selection Board duty,
                            that while here you will of course be discussing with your superiors
                            future relations with Communist China and that for your background in
                            doing so you would welcome <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName>'s views in some depth, particularly on the following
                            questions. In asking the following questions you would disclaim having
                            any instructions on these points and couch your remarks in purely
                            personal terms.</p>
                        <pb n="119" xml:id="pg_119" facs="0155"/>
                        <p>You might preface your remarks by stating that Peking of course has its
                            view of the world and the presumed historical imperatives of its
                            “revolution”, while the US also has its views on the subject. Also, we
                            of course each have our own views on the problem of Taiwan. While these
                            cannot now be reconciled, it should be perfectly clear to <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> that regardless of our domestic
                            differences with respect to Taiwan and Communist China he must take it
                            as a fact that no American administration ever could or would consider
                            turning the people of Taiwan against their will over to Communist China.
                            However you do assume that the Peking leaders have some concern for the
                            welfare and fate of the great people of China. You know the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> certainly has a strong concern and
                            sense of responsibility for the future and fate of the American people.
                            Recognizing these facts, you wonder whether there are not some common
                            points of interest between the two governments that can be identified
                            and cooperation undertaken, or is it the view of Peking that the only
                            outcome is an eventual holocaust involving our two peoples. It is the
                            view of the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> that such need not be
                            the case. You would hope that this is also ChiCom view in spite of
                            seeming meaning ChiCom public doctrine and therefore, that there is at
                            least common interest in avoiding war.</p>
                        <p>If this is case you wonder what implications ChiComs would draw
                            therefrom. It is your view that if ChiComs accept this thesis it is
                            important to look for even smallest opportunities to improve atmosphere
                            between two countries. It is for this reason you have been laboring
                            point of prisoners and newsmen. However, ChiCom response has
                            consistently been pegged to unrealistic demands on Taiwan, etc. This is
                            hardly way to make any progress. You wonder whether ChiComs see any
                            realistic steps that could be taken. If so you would like to explore and
                            discuss while in Washington.</p>
                        <p>For example, you understand that through ChiCom ConGen, Geneva, ChiComs
                            have invited Dr. Samuel Rosen of New York to demonstrate his unique
                            surgical technique for relief of common form of deafness. Under present
                            conditions <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> had no choice but to
                            discourage his travel. However, if ChiComs are still interested you
                            would be willing further explore matter on your return to Washington.
                            Does <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> think issuance of
                            passport to Dr. Rosen would be helpful and if so is there any gesture
                            ChiComs could make now or later? You are not seeking to bargain or enter
                            into agreements but rather to see whether in quiet way there are
                            reciprocal small steps that can be taken by two governments that would
                            offer some hope of relieving present complete impasse in relations.
                            Therefore, prior to your return to Washington you would welcome any
                            thoughts <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> may have in this
                            regard and if he desires would be willing again informally to meet with
                                <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> prior to your
                            departure.</p>
                        <p>If you think desirable there would be no objection to your inviting
                                <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> to your residence or
                            other secure place for informal meeting if this <pb n="120" xml:id="pg_120" facs="0156"/>could be handled in manner that would
                            avoid publicity. In this event, of course, recognize you may have to
                            accept similar return invitation from him.</p>

                            opposite direction. US Government trying worsen Sino-US relations with
                            President's invitation Chen Cheng's visit. Noted communique reiterated
                            US support <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> “usurpation” China's
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> seat. Only with US support was
                                “<persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> clique” able
                            be entrenched Taiwan and in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> seat. No
                            indication change this policy. Noted US Senate resolution also pledged
                            support Chiang-Kai-shek usurpation China's <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> seat. Stated since August 11 ChiCom spokesman had issued
                            158th through 165th series warnings indicating US trying to worsen
                            relations through intrusion Chinese territory and territorial waters.
                            Stated Berlin crisis used as pretext for increasing military
                            expenditures and some US leaders state global action may be taken.
                            Increasingly blatant hostility toward Chinese people one part of this.
                            Above in contravention my opening statement. American suggestions for
                            exchange newsmen were a mockery; such exchange could not be considered
                                <pb n="121" xml:id="pg_121" facs="0157"/>during the exchange of Vice

                            Cannot skip main issue: Seizure of Taiwan by US. This also applies
                            newsmen question. Chinese have had sincere desire for success since
                            inception these talks but no response from US. Rather US has had policy
                            of hostility even more undisguised. Chance of success depends on change
                            in US occupation of China's territory Taiwan.</p>
                        <p>I replied I could not accept his unwarranted attack on meeting between

                            communique. Communique presents assessment international situation which
                                <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> leaders should consider
                            carefully and thoughtfully if indeed they thought to contribute
                            lessening tensions in Far East. Rejected <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> accusation US warships and planes intrude ChiCom
                            waters stating we governed by international law not unilateral ChiCom

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> replied could not accept my
                            explanation meeting between President and Chen Cheng. No real peace in
                            Far East mainly because US occupying Chinese territory Taiwan which has
                            upset peace. Reiterated US must change policy.</p>
                        <p>I replied that threat and use of force against <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> is real point at issue. US and <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> have treaty relations and defense alliance. US forces
                            in Taiwan as result. Basically we have asked for renunciation of force
                            which would bring peace to area. Unfortunately <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> side rejected this and tension
                            continues. I then continued with substance paragraph 4 Department

                                the best approach to the talks was to try to reach agreement on
                                practical concrete questions; the United States did not expect
                                    <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName>'s side to give up
                                their position on fundamental issues and did not believe they

                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> and I exchanged

                            been many problems between us. In these ambassadorial talks we have a
                            very heavy responsibility to solve them. No one is willing to be
                            responsible for a mission that has failed. A famous British diplomat,
                            Neville Henderson, once wrote a book, Failure of a Mission, which
                            described a diplomat's unfortunate experience along this line. You have
                            said that you appreciate the candid statements which I had made during
                            our previous informal meeting. Then I explained that Chinese people did
                            not intentionally set themselves against American people and all of our
                            leaders, including Chairman <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>,
                            Premier <persName corresp="#p_CEZE1">Chou</persName> and Foreign
                            Minister Chen, have said many times that Chinese people are friendly to
                            American people. We hope that US policy can be built on realistic
                            foundations and that US will be able to change its former methods. (At
                            this point, <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> entered into
                            discussion of why he felt the “<persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang
                                Kai-shek</persName> regime” had fallen despite fact that US had
                            given large amounts of aid. He attributed this defeat to the “personal
                            dictatorship” of <persName>Chiang</persName> and to his policy of
                            “action against the people's interest”. Likewise <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> had been thrown out by Korean
                            people despite US aid. <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName>
                            predicted that some day he and I would be discussing the fate of Taiwan
                            just as we today were discussing the past defeat of <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> on mainland of

                        <p>I remember after <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName>
                            had evacuated to Taiwan, President Truman stated that Taiwan problem was
                            Chinese internal affair and that US had no intention to meddle
                                therein.<note n="2" xml:id="d52fn2">Reference is to a statement made

                            non-interference principle, we believe Sino-American relations would be
                            different from what they are today. We also believe that US policy
                            toward Taiwan is of no benefit to US but rather detrimental to its best
                            interest. China will never threaten US interests and will never expand
                            outwards. This is because not only does China have sufficient resources
                            and territory for its own development, but also (and this is not least
                            important) because socialist system forbids expansionist policy. China
                            and US were located on opposite sides of world. Being such a long way
                            apart, there is no reason why there should be any direct clash between
                            us.</p>

                            The big powers, including China and US, should seek to adjust their
                            differences in order that world peace be maintained. Basis of Chinese
                            foreign policy is adherence to the five principles. These should be
                            applied to Sino-American relations. Thus, we have advocated creation of

                            discord between China and US. Since the Chinese people are injured
                            party, it is normal that they manifest their feeling of being wronged.
                            Just as people of Tunisia, so Chinese people want to regain their own
                            territory and to restore their territorial integrity.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Ambassador, your return to US provides you opportunity to make a new
                            appraisal of Sino-American relations and for your government to adopt
                            more positive approach. We believe if your government takes over-all
                            view, it will be seen that wisest move by the US Government would be to
                            normalize relations with us. We hope something useful will come out of
                            your discussions in Washington and that on your return you will be able
                            to take positive steps to change present state of affairs between
                            us.</p>
                        <p>I believe many US statesmen are aware of this situation. I had an
                            opportunity to talk with Senator Humphrey at Geneva, he told me he hoped
                            someday he might visit China in order to contribute to promotion of
                            better relations between our two countries. He told me also he had
                            campaigned consistently for Chinese participation in international
                            disarmament talks.</p>
                        <p>To express a willingness to promote better relations is one thing, but to
                            adopt real measures to this end is another. One must prescribe correct
                            medicine for the treatment of a particular disease; it is not enough
                            merely to apply a panacea like tiger balm. In India I learned a saying
                            which went something like this: I want to live, but, I must also live
                            and let live. We believe reason will prevail. Thus I am happy for this
                            opportunity to exchange views with the Ambassador before he returns to
                            Washington. Despite long interval before our next meeting, I hope that
                            when you return, we shall be in a position to make progress.</p>

                        <p>282. Eyes only for the Secretary. Although <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> did not respond positively to first part my
                            informal presentation (Embtel 281)<note n="1" xml:id="d53fn1">
                                <ref target="#d52">Document 52</ref>.</note> I considered occasion
                            sufficiently favorable to proceed with expansion of remarks suggested in

                                <ref target="#d50">Document 50</ref>.</note> which I emphasized was

                            way be broken.</p>
                        <p>I concluded by informing <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName>
                            that, after short holiday, I should return to Warsaw on August 28, to
                            stay here until September 2 when I would depart for Washington. I told
                            him that, had he any response to make to my presentation, I would be
                            available to meet with him privately some time between August 28 and
                            September 2.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> replied: I also think both
                            sides should seek out common ground. It is most important both countries
                            act responsibly in field of international affairs in order that peace be
                            preserved. It is duty of both of us to resolve quarrels and strife
                            between us. Concern which you have expressed concerning war with regard
                            to Taiwan, however, is superfluous. We have said many times Taiwan is an
                            internal matter for China in which US has no right to interfere. If the
                            US were to act in conformance with President Truman's statement and not
                            interfere, then I believe greater half of Taiwan problem would be
                            solved. Once Taiwan problem is normalized then basic issues between
                            China and US can be solved. It is unwise for US Government to pay so
                            much attention to small advantages only to lose important ones. For
                            example, US persistence in its economic blockade against China has not
                            prevented our reconstruction; on contrary, this blockade only hurts US
                            economy. In similar way, US opposition to restoration to China of its
                            legal position in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> does not prevent
                            development of our friendship with peoples of the world but it does do
                            great harm to US prestige. Perhaps you do not now share my views but I
                            believe day will come when you will realize this truth.</p>
                        <p>I haven't heard about desire to have Dr. Samuel Rosen go to China. I will
                            look into this matter and if it is necessary to have another
                            conversation with you, I will let you know.</p>
                        <p>I then explained again to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> that this was apparently case in which Chinese
                            doctors hoped to have Doctor Rosen visit China in order to demonstrate
                            his new technique to them but that failing <pb n="126" xml:id="pg_126" facs="0162"/>any small gesture of concession from ChiComs side we
                            had to discourage visit. I then once again expanded on our conviction
                            that if both sides will seek resolution of small practical questions,
                            this would promote relaxation of tension and maintenance peace.</p>
                        <p>I also took up his frequent reference to January 1950 statement by
                            President Truman that US regarded resolution of Taiwan problem as
                            internal affair of Chinese. I said outbreak of Korean war had changed
                            the opinion of the American people concerning the ability of small
                            nations in Asia to withstand by themselves external aggression. Basing
                            himself on this new conviction of the American people, President Truman
                            in June of 1950 had made second statement<note n="3" xml:id="d53fn3">Reference is to a statement made by Truman on June 27, 1950; for

                            took completely altered situation into account.</p>
                        <p>The meeting broke up with both of us assuring the other that despite the
                            obvious seriousness of our differences, we must all exert every effort
                            to resolve the problems between us.</p>
                        <p>Comment: With excellent interpreters on both sides and with reiteration
                            of the theme through formal meeting and both halves of informal talk,
                                <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> could hardly have
                            failed to get the point of our approach. His fallback on classic ChiCom
                            position was to be expected as initial reaction but he was far from
                            hostile and at end he felt himself obliged to pay tribute to idea of
                            efforts toward improvement. Since ChiComs will doubtless wish weigh our
                            suggestions in light many other factors, I question if I shall hear from
                                <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> before my departure
                            September 2. Interesting he did not belabor ChiCom <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> membership issue, probably for reasons of
                            pride and desire show lack of concern. Significant also he wished avoid
                            appearance of rupture of talks by insisting on tentative date three
                            months hence for next meeting.</p>

                                is apparently to circular telegram 253, August 12. (Department of

                            statement of our current view. It has gone to all our missions and
                            responses are being collected and tabulated. So far only about a third
                            of the answers are in, but they suggest that this position is worth
                            holding for the moment.</p>
                        <p>The nut of this proposal, as you know, is that we will seek a majority
                            for the “important question” position and then expect to have a blocking
                            one-third against any resolution that would admit representation. We
                            have sweetened this proposal with the notion of a commission to study
                            the broader problems of criteria for <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            membership and the composition of the Security Council and the Economic
                            and Social Council. This commission would report a year later.</p>
                        <p>Until we have more responses to this circular, and until we see what
                            happens on the Outer Mongolian issue, I see no basis for a change in our
                            current stand. The Outer Mongolian question may come up next week, and
                            we are keeping the heat on the Chinese Nationalists. In particular, I am

                            hold. The Chinese Nationalists are trying to hint that you are their
                            friend and cannot really mean what your letter says. They are also
                            suggesting that the Congress may not agree with you, and I shall say a

                        <p>As we agreed, I talked to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YGKC1">Yeh</persName> this afternoon. I found him extraordinarily
                            understanding and clear about the issues. I began by emphasizing to him
                            the President's letter<note n="1" xml:id="d55fn1">See <ref target="#d54fn3">footnote 3, Document 54</ref>.</note>
                            represented not only the views of the Department of State, but the most
                            careful and considered judgment of the President himself. He took the
                            point.</p>
                        <p>We then turned to what we might be able to get in return if in fact his
                            government should decide not to veto, and there ensued the discussion
                            which I reported to you on the telephone. On the basis of that telephone
                            conversation, I have made it plain to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YGKC1">Yeh</persName> that if, in fact, his government
                            can give us private assurance that it will not veto Outer Mongolia, we
                            will be glad to join with the Republic of China in attempting to get
                            maximum support for our position on Chinese representation from
                            French-African states. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YGKC1">Yeh</persName> particularly emphasized his hope that in this
                            politicking we could point out that this is a case of Soviet blackmail
                            and that while we are prepared to be helpful in this case,
                            French-African states ought not to get in the habit of putting heat on
                            us on the Chinese representation issue every time the Soviets put the
                            heat on them.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YGKC1">Yeh</persName> pointed out to me
                            that it might be reassuring to his government if it could hear the same
                            noise from Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DEF1">Drumright</persName>
                            that he was hearing from me, and accordingly I suggest that it may be
                            useful for you to send a dispatch to <persName corresp="#p_DEF1">Drumright</persName>, in whatever form you think right, to back up
                            what seems to me to have been a fruitful conversation.<note n="2" xml:id="d55fn2">Telegram 129 to Taipei, August 23, instructed
                                    <persName corresp="#p_DEF1">Drumright</persName> to tell the
                                Foreign Minister that if the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                                would give private assurances that it would refrain from vetoing
                                Outer Mongolian membership, the United States would approach African
                                states and in return for this <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                                concession, solicit their support for the U.S. position on Chinese

                                303/8-2361)</note> Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YGKC1">Yeh</persName> told me that it was his private impression that
                            President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> has not yet made
                            up his mind but will do so in the next two or three days. <persName corresp="#p_YGKC1">Yeh</persName> is most anxious that his own
                            strong support for a change in his government's position should not be
                            reported in any way to Taipei, and therefore I hope your dispatch to
                                <persName corresp="#p_DEF1">Drumright</persName> may avoid reference
                            to my conversation with <persName corresp="#p_YGKC1">Yeh</persName>.</p>

                        <p>A paper entitled “The Offshore Islands: Alternative Courses and Probable
                            Consequences,” drafted by <persName corresp="#p_REE1">Edward E.

                            of State <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>. The paper discussed
                            the offshore islands problem and set forth four alternative courses of
                            action which it summarized as follows:</p>
                        <p>“Theoretically at least, the US might: (a) acquiesce in continued <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> occupation of the offshore islands
                            without extending our present commitments; (b) acquiesce, and in
                            addition extend to the offshores an unequivocal US defense commitment;
                            (c) use all suitable means now at our disposal in an effort to bring
                            about early evacuation of the offshore islands; or (d) pursue the
                            objective of bringing about a <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            evacuation over an extended period of time, using such means as are now
                            at hand or may become available in a patient campaign which we would
                            hope to keep sufficiently low-keyed to avoid a damaging crisis.”

                                <gloss target="#t_SP1">S/P</gloss> recommends the fourth

                        <p>I opened with a short statement emphasizing this was private meeting
                            between us.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> referred our last meeting
                            and stated would like give his position noting I had suggested we meet
                            again prior my return US. Said at last meeting he had put forth clearly
                            position his government and therefore had doubts necessity of such
                            meetings over such short space of time. He first noted since last
                            meeting international situation had changed significantly. US had
                            undertaken series moves and military provocations leading to dangerous
                            military-like atmosphere. This could not help but affect today's meeting
                            and would like to express several points of his own opinions about these
                            moves with hope I would take these to Washington. He wished explain his
                            point of view clearly and so had prepared text of his remarks.</p>
                        <p>He then started reading lengthy prepared Chinese text. Stated that lately
                            US and its allies with the pretext of the Berlin crisis had caused
                            situation approaching war by sending military contingent to West Berlin,
                            as well as other provocative acts of West German revanchists vis-a-vis
                            GDR. Said “I would like to ask you whether this is to lead to the
                            calling forth of military conflict in Europe.” Noted the realization in
                            South Vietnam of so-called storm plan increase of military forces and
                            training of troops in Far East for despatch to neutral Laos, and asked
                            whether this aimed at eruption of war in Indochina. Noted maneuvers of
                            US Marines in Okinawa and land maneuvers in South Korea, stating these
                            further increased tension in Northeast Asia. Accused US military
                            airplanes and warships of gradually more frequent violations Chinese
                            territory. In connection with maneuvers of <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> forces on Matsu and Quemoy asked whether
                            these actions preparatory to landing on China coast. Stated that they
                            could not help but take these very seriously and <pb n="131" xml:id="pg_131" facs="0167"/>issued very strong warning. Would like
                            to take occasion to voice his personal concern about dangerous policies
                            of my government and expressed hope I would bring his point of view to
                            attention my government. War policy present administration had improved
                            upon that of late Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> and leads to an increasingly rapid isolation of
                            the US on international scene. Observed people had hoped Democratic
                            Administration and particularly President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> could have changed US policy to one of peace.
                            This was particularly so since President had emphasized his strategy of
                            peace during campaign. But now he noted US Government does not have
                            intention of turning away from path of war but on contrary approached
                            gradually closer to it. US Government had already decided to step onto
                            path of war. These steps have significantly been accelerated, not only
                            does US prepare for atomic war but also has preparations for limited
                            war. US has set time bomb in heart of Europe and various countries in
                            Asia, Africa and South America. Occupation by US on Taiwan leads to
                            especially dangerous military threat greatly increasing threat of war
                            against China.</p>
                        <p>Desired tell me frankly this type of policy could only lead to worsening
                            international situation. This course was meeting with greatly stronger
                            opposition from people of world including people of US. Chinese value
                            peace and are fighting to create peaceful international conditions.
                            China and US are two great powers and both have responsibility for peace
                            throughout world. War will not bring any advantages whatever and he
                            convinced I would agree with his view. Both countries should make every
                            effort take advantage these contacts and extend greatest efforts to this
                            end. Talks already numbered 106 but up to now no progress achieved.
                            Facts show that reason for this is US interference in international
                            affairs China and Taiwan. Believed betterment of Chinese-US relations
                            required above all solution this basic problem.</p>
                        <p>Noted that during our discussions on August 15<note n="2" xml:id="d57fn2">See <ref target="#d51">Documents 51</ref>-<ref target="#d53">53</ref>.</note> I had said no US Government could ever turn
                            Taiwan over to China and remove US forces from Taiwan. This was evidence
                            US wished continue these talks as means to further aggressive policies
                            of the US and does not have least intention resolve basic problem by
                            means of negotiation. Indications are US Government intends to worsen
                            these basic differences by means of these negotiations. Said at previous
                            meeting I had utilized US responsibility towards <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> as pretext for US
                            occupation Taiwan and threatened ChiComs with war. Doubted if I really
                            believed that type pretext and it had no significance.</p>
                        <p> US responsible for existence <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang
                                Kai-shek</persName> and facts show he is US creature. This is
                            intervention in China internal affairs, equivalent to <pb n="132" xml:id="pg_132" facs="0168"/>situation between Japanese Tojo
                            Government and Manchukuo. This is humbug. At same time situation is
                            important responsibility for China. Again reminded me that US position
                            will never be accepted by China and that if US does not recognize this
                            it will be a great historical mistake. Problem of Taiwan is principal
                            problem between China and US. Without resolution will be difficult to
                            resolve other problems. Repeated he wished me to bring this to attention
                            of Washington and again desired state China very much wished to resolve
                            various problems between China and US peacefully and he hoped we would
                            put forth constructive propositions looking toward the removal of US
                            forces from Taiwan.</p>
                        <p>He then stated we had already agreed that the next meeting would be
                            December 5. But in view of the serious situation we should maintain
                            contact and be prepared for it (contact) at moment's notice. In response
                            our questions to clarify this point, he stated 107th meeting still on
                            agenda for December 5 and added that if important matters arise in
                            interim they would communicate.</p>
                        <p>I realized he had made an extraordinary response to my approach. I
                            categorically believed [<hi rend="italic">denied</hi>?] false
                            accusations he had made against my government. His remarks about
                            President surpassed bounds of common politeness. Recrimination not
                            helpful but was bound to point out that chief problem of today is action
                            from Communist side threatening peace all over world. This was my
                            necessary answer since <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> had
                            chosen to broaden area of discussion.</p>
                        <p>I corrected his statement about what I had said concerning Taiwan,
                            reiterating no American Government would turn Taiwan over to mainland
                            against will of its people. US forces in Taiwan area, [apparent
                            omission] this being purpose of my personal suggestions to him.
                            Reiterated necessity finding common ground on matters of mutual interest
                            and advisability making progress, even in small matters, as means
                            breaking impasse. Rejection my suggestions matter of personal regret.
                            Danger was situation would get worse but both sides still have time to
                            consider and I hoped <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> would
                            make personal effort to have my previous suggestions reviewed.</p>
                        <p>I also doubted usefulness this kind of private talks if they continued in
                            this sense and reminded him he took initiative in starting them. I had
                            hoped his initiatives here and in Geneva might be constructive and so
                            had attempted to offer constructive response. While great effort
                            required on both sides, was worthwhile to relieve tensions in order
                            avoid far greater dangers. Asked <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> if he believed statement US using these talks to
                            further aggressive policies. Would have to report this remark to my
                            government and let it draw its own conclusions.</p>
                        <p>Thereafter there followed an exchange of the type customary at formal
                            meetings regarding status <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang
                                Kai-shek</persName> government. Nothing new was said.</p>
                        <pb n="133" xml:id="pg_133" facs="0169"/>
                        <p>Comment: <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> obviously read from
                            prepared governmental statement which completely reversed more
                            conciliatory attitude he had displayed at previous private meeting
                            Sunday Geneva. He seemed slightly embarrassed and made effort to be
                            cordial on my departure.</p>

                        <p>On September 5, 1961, President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> discussed the question of Chinese representation
                            in a meeting at the White House with Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, Representative to the United
                            Nations <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName>, Assistant
                            Secretary for International Organization Affairs <persName corresp="#p_CJH1">Cleveland</persName>, Special Assistant to the

                            Special Counsel to the President Theodore C. Sorensen, and Special
                            Assistant to the President Schlesinger.</p>
                        <p>A memorandum of action taken at the meeting, drafted by <persName corresp="#p_CJH1">Cleveland</persName> and dated September 5, reads
                            in part as follows:</p>
                        <p>“a. In the Secretary of State's memorandum of September 5 to the
                            President on Chinese Representation in the United Nations, the President
                            was asked two policy questions:</p>
                        <p>“(i) Do you believe that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> should now be authorized to make it known
                            informally to other delegations that the United States does not preclude
                            the possibility that a General Assembly study committee would recommend
                            for the consideration of the General Assembly at its 1962 session an
                            essentially “two Chinas” solution based on the successor state approach?
                            and</p>
                        <p>“(ii) Are you prepared to authorize Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> to vote affirmatively in the
                            Security Council on the application for <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> membership of the Mongolian People's Republic, if in his
                            judgment such a vote will substantially assist him in developing support
                            among the French African states for the U.S. position on Chinese
                            Representation?</p>
                        <p>“The President answered ‘yes’ to both of these questions. He expressed
                            again his judgment of the importance of keeping the Chinese Communists
                            out of the United Nations this year.</p>
                        <p>“b. The President said he wants to write President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> a further letter, in
                            which he would lay stress on the United States interests in the Chinese
                            Representation question and therefore on the related matter of the
                            Mongolian and Mauritanian applications for <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> membership.</p>
                        <p>“c. Individuals in the United States who are particularly close to the
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> will be brought into the
                            discussion. The President will talk to Congressman <pb n="134" xml:id="pg_134" facs="0170"/>Walter Judd. The Secretary of State
                            will follow up Henry Cabot Lodge's call to him on the Outer Mongolia
                            issue, with a view to further discussions with Henry Luce on the matter.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> will speak
                            to Roy Howard of Scripps-Howard.” (Filed with a covering memorandum of

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s September 5 memorandum
                            cited above reported that the Department had conducted exploratory
                            discussions concerning a two-pronged approach, combining a resolution
                            declaring any change in China's representation an “important question”
                            with the establishment by the General Assembly of a study committee to
                            consider criteria for U.N. membership and related problems. The
                            consultations thus far had indicated that there was no certainty of
                            obtaining the required majority for either proposal. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> stated that the Department would
                            continue its efforts for the two-pronged approach but that a further
                            “sweetener” might have to be added. He posed the two policy questions
                            quoted in <persName corresp="#p_CJH1">Cleveland</persName>'s memorandum
                            of action, recommending in favor of the second but stating his view that
                            the first step was not yet necessary. (Ibid., 303/9-561)</p>

                        <p>“Dear Mr. President:</p>
                        <p>I have given careful thought to your letter of August 26.<note n="2" xml:id="d59fn2">Transmitted in telegram 195 from Taipei, August 27.
                                (Ibid., Presidential Correspondence: Lot 66 D 204) See the
                                Supplement.</note> I will not conceal from you my deep
                            disappointment that you would utilize the <pb n="135" xml:id="pg_135" facs="0171"/>veto in circumstances that would prevent the admission
                            not only of Outer Mongolia but also of Mauritania to the United
                            Nations.</p>
                        <p>It is clear that even though we share the common goal of preventing the
                            admission of the Chinese Communists to the United Nations you are not
                            persuaded that a veto on Outer Mongolia would inevitably have very
                            serious consequences for the Chinese representation question. Briefly,
                            the United States has concluded that a satisfactory resolution of this
                            question may prove the decisive element in determining whether we can
                            prevent the replacement of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> by
                            the Chinese Communists in the United Nations this fall. I am sure you
                            must be in possession, through your able representative in New York, of
                            the same hard facts that lead us to this conclusion.</p>
                        <p>This matter is of such vital importance to the United States that if we
                            are unable to reach agreement I am sure you will understand that we must
                            reserve our freedom to pursue whichever avenue we consider best
                            calculated to advance the objective which we both seek. (Appropriate

                        </list>
                        <p>Following is a summary of the standing instructions on the Chinese
                            representation issue, which were worked out during your two recent
                            visits to Washington. They have been approved by the President.</p>
                        <p>U.S. objectives in the 16th General Assembly are twofold: To keep
                            Communist China out and Nationalist China in the United Nations.</p>
                        <p>Your instructions are to attempt to accomplish these objectives by the
                            following steps:</p>
                        <pb n="136" xml:id="pg_136" facs="0172"/>
                        <p>1. Induce several countries broadly representative to inscribe on the
                            General Assembly an item entitled “Representation of China”. Use your
                            own judgment as to the countries and the title of the item. If you
                            cannot induce other countries to take this initiative, the United States
                            should inscribe the item promptly.</p>
                        <p>2. Attempt to get the General Assembly to declare that any change in the
                            representation of China is an “important question” within the meaning of
                            Article 18 of the Charter. My understanding is that such a decision
                            requires a simple majority vote and that an important question requires
                            a two-thirds vote.</p>
                        <p>3. Persuade the Assembly to appoint a committee to consider criteria for
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> membership (including the question
                            of Chinese representation) and the composition of the Security Council
                            and ECOSOC; and to report to the next General Assembly a year hence. We
                            strongly prefer one committee rather than a special committee on Chinese
                            representation.</p>
                        <p>4. You are authorized to say—privately, if believed essential—that the
                            United States does not exclude the possibility that the study committee
                            would recommend to the 1962 session a successor state solution if that
                            becomes necessary.</p>
                        <p>5. The U.S. objective is to head off any consideration of the
                            representation of China as a credentials question requiring a simple
                            majority vote. If the foregoing proposals are rejected by the Assembly
                            and a defeat of U.S. objectives, stated above, appears imminent you
                            should then seek instructions as to whether we should adopt the
                            successor state approach.</p>
                        <p>6. When the applications of Outer Mongolia and Mauritania come before the
                            Security Council, you are authorized to abstain or vote for the
                            admission of Outer Mongolia to thereby assist with the election of
                            Mauritania, assuming that these elections take place at a time when you
                            deem the support of the French-African States necessary in the larger
                            question of Chinese Representation.<note n="1" xml:id="d60fn1">In a

                            accurate reporting from Ambassadors on attitude host government but such
                            reporting in turn becomes point of departure for maximum effort Embassy
                            as well as Dept. to search for means for giving effect to US policy.</p>
                        <p>If <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> is determined to “go down with
                            ship” rather than compromise on Outer Mongolia this is <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> decision for which we will share no
                            responsibility and we shall make it quite clear if necessary that <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> elected to commit political suicide in
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> despite our best efforts.</p>
                        <p>If <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> dissatisfaction with US is
                            mounting reverse is equally true. If we have applied persistent pressure
                            on Outer Mongolia issue it is for no other purpose than to marshall
                            support on ChiRep issue. Of course we are consulting other governments
                            on ChiRep issue but with none so fully or in so timely a fashion as with
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>. Their complaint this score is
                            not on failure consult but our inability agree with them at every
                            point.</p>
                        <p>President personally has spent enormous effort to mobilize international
                            support for <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>. It has been a principal
                            topic of conversation with the many distinguished statesmen whom he has
                            seen since January 20. Department's effort has been equally intensive.
                            We cannot accept <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> doubts our motives
                            and must ask that you react sharply to any such implications by <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> officials.</p>
                        <p>We had not supposed we have failed to clarify what we will do in SC on
                            Outer Mongolia. Our vote on that question will be used to support <pb n="138" xml:id="pg_138" facs="0174"/>
                            <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> on over-riding question ChiRep. That
                            means we will not share responsibility losing African votes on ChiRep by
                            negative vote or by organizing abstentions. We will cast affirmative
                            vote if necessary to clarify this point. President and I made this
                            entirely clear to Chen Cheng.</p>
                        <p>It is sign of increasing isolation <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            from reality that they persist in disregarding best advice their own
                            representatives and best friends abroad. It is patent absurdity for
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> to conclude that inability
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> to persuade enlarged and changed
                            membership <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> is due to lack of US
                            effort. If we cannot persuade <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>, whose
                            primary support is US, to meet us on any of several significant matters
                            whom can we persuade?</p>
                        <p>If <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> officials are tempted to give
                            signal for expressions frustration and anger at US, they would make
                            fundamental error in supposing what <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            thinks of US is sole preoccupation both sides. Someone in Taipei would
                            be well advised to begin to worry about what US thinks about <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>. We have seen very little investment by
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> in US-Chinese relations.</p>
                        <p>We will do everything we can to help <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            in its difficult position except to join it in reckless policy which
                            insures its own defeat. If leadership <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> cannot break through its own mythology and give
                            leadership to its own people on course necessary to preserve its
                            international position, our ability to help them is severely
                            limited.</p>
                        <p>Urge you to make entirely clear to <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            gravity of their situation. We wish to give them strongest possible
                            support because of fundamental common interests but we also want support
                            from them.</p>

                            and military strengths and weaknesses.</p>
                        <pb n="139" xml:id="pg_139" facs="0175"/>
                        <p>Note</p>
                        <p>This estimate is based on what now appears to be the most probable course
                            of the important factors likely to affect Communist China's industrial,
                            scientific, and military growth over this period. Primary factors are
                            the race between food production and population growth, and the
                            Sino-Soviet dispute. Since these and many other factors could develop in
                            a number of different ways, our judgments are necessarily tentative,
                            particularly in view of the dearth of information on current conditions
                            and the degree of the recent disruption of Peiping's long-range plans.
                            However, a “contingency” section considers the effect of unanticipated
                            developments in the primary factors of agriculture and Sino-Soviet
                            relations. For both the main estimate and the contingencies it has been
                            assumed that neither general war nor major international war in the Far
                            East has occurred.</p>
                        <p>Conclusions</p>
                        <p>1. In 1971 mainland China will probably continue to be under the control
                            of a ruthless, determined, and unified Communist leadership which
                            remains basically hostile to the US. Communist China's position as one
                            of the major power centers of the world will have been greatly
                            strengthened. Communist China will probably have more than 850 million
                            people and will continue to have the world's largest standing army and
                            military reserve. It is likely to be among the top three nations in the
                            production of coal, steel, and electric power. (Paras. 5, 9, 14, 18)</p>
                        <p>2. By 1971 the Chinese Communists are likely to have a modest stockpile
                            of domestically produced nuclear weapons. They will be producing
                            short-range and probably medium-range missiles, and it may be that they
                            will have a submarine-launched missile capability. The possibility
                            cannot be excluded that they can produce an operational intercontinental
                            ballistic missile system with thermonuclear warheads by 1971.<note n="1" xml:id="d62fn1">These estimates of Communist China's missile and
                                nuclear capabilities in 1971 are preliminary and tentative, subject
                                to revision after intensive analysis in the forthcoming <gloss target="#t_SNIE1">SNIE</gloss> 13-4-61, “Chinese Communist

                                continued Soviet cooperation at somewhere near the present level.
                                The contingencies of a marked increase or decrease in Soviet
                                cooperation are discussed in paragraphs 24 and 25. [Footnote in the

                            adequate diet in good years, suffering shortages in bad years. Although
                            impressive advances will have been made in science and technology, the
                            quality, diversity, and technological level of production still will be
                            considerably below that of Japan, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, and the industrial nations of the West. (Paras. 6-11,

                        <p>4. As Communist China's strength grows, relations with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will become an increasingly difficult
                            problem. Communist China will become even less restrained in taking
                            political or military action independent of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. It is likely, however, that their common commitment
                            to the Communist cause, and, especially, their common enmity toward the
                            anti-Communist world will preserve sufficient unity to enable Moscow and
                            Peiping to act in concert against the West, especially in times of major
                            challenge. (Para. 17)</p>

                            The contingencies considered were agricultural failure and a major
                            change either for the better or for the worse in Sino-Soviet relations.

                                which reads in part as follows: “The Sec wondered about one last
                                message to Taipei—if this takes the course it appears to be on if
                                they veto OM and the African states vote with the SU and Peiping
                                will be seated and the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> will be
                                evicted. Then <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would get
                                indignant at us—if all this happens we will make it publicly clear
                                they elected to commit suicide and there will be a review of our
                                relations. This is not just Outer Mongolia but a question of having
                                anyone including us with them. The Sec will not take anything from
                                them on this issue if they get themselves unseated in the face of
                                their veto of OM. We are going to make this so clear that the
                                American people will lose their interest out there. Somebody there
                                should worry about it. M thinks <persName>Chiang</persName> is
                                irrational on this but probably we should put it forward to him. M
                                thinks he will take it as a threat though. The Sec said it is a
                                threat. The issue is lost if they pursue this line of events.”

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SC1">Shen</persName> said that following
                            Secretary's conversation with <persName corresp="#p_TT1">Tsiang</persName> yesterday matter had again been reported to
                            Taipei with as yet no comment. He reviewed for the Secretary again the
                            reasons for <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>'s obduracy on Outer
                            Mongolian issue.</p>
                        <p>Secretary said that he wanted to be absolutely sure that <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> fully appreciated the gravity of the
                            situation which we faced and its long-reaching consequences. He pointed
                            out that should <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>'s recalcitrance on
                            the Outer Mongolia veto issue result in <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>'s departure from the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>,
                            there could well be feeling in Taiwan that <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>'s humiliation due to lack of effort on part of US. In
                            order to protect our position we would have no alternative but to review
                            the facts and disassociate ourselves completely from <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> position. Secretary emphasized point
                            that choice before US was between acquiescence to entry of Outer
                            Mongolia or Peking and in this dilemma our position was clear. He
                            reviewed again for the Minister and the Ambassador the tremendous
                            investment in effort which the United States had expended in mobilizing
                            support for <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>. United States also had
                            much at stake in the outcome of this vital issue. If appreciation of
                            this fact were completely disregarded by the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> an unfavorable outcome could unfortunately affect our
                            future relations.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_SC1">Shen</persName> seemed to appreciate
                            situation now facing <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>, he followed
                            the line that bowing to Soviet blackmail on this issue would seriously
                            undermine morale and public support for <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> domestically. He seemed to take unrealistic refuge in
                            possibility that African groups, such as Brazzaville body, would not
                            vote in unison and that the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>'s
                            position may thus still be salvaged on the “important question” even
                            though they exercise their veto or abstain in the SC on Outer Mongolia.
                            In response to the query as to their exact position as of today,
                                <persName corresp="#p_SC1">Shen</persName> said it was to use the
                            veto if necessary if sufficient abstentions in the Security Council
                            would not preclude Outer Mongolia's entrance.</p>

                            correct in my impression that my conversation with T.S. <persName corresp="#p_TT1">Tsiang</persName> and Chen at New York last

                                <persName>Chiang</persName>'s being in a mood to change his mind on
                            the vote on the Outer Mongolia issue if he is provided with what he
                            would consider satisfactory answers on the specific points raised by him
                            with you. (Incidentally, you should have no hesitancy in assuring
                                <persName>Chiang</persName> that what I said to <persName corresp="#p_TT1">Tsiang</persName> and Chen accurately reflects full
                            views of the President.) We have therefore sought to provide you with
                            bona fide assurances which may have desired results. You should avoid
                            any impression that we are in any way backing away from the statements
                            which I made to <persName corresp="#p_TT1">Tsiang</persName> and
                            Chen.</p>
                        <p>We have added impression that <persName>Chiang</persName> has never fully
                            appreciated international repercussions both to US and <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> which would result from situation in
                            which Chinese might find themselves out of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. You should do everything possible emphasize that this
                            is not simply matter of seat in international organization in which
                                <persName>Chiang</persName> has only peripheral interest but
                            impinges on every phase of <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> relations
                            abroad, including ability of United States to defend them.</p>

                            believe you should make further comment, drawing on following
                            supplementary statements addressed to numbered questions:</p>

                                that if an affirmative vote was cast, it would be done to satisfy

                        <p>2. Question of “White Paper” has not been considered here. However, as
                            already noted we would certainly be obliged inform American public of
                            our reasons for divergence with <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> in
                            event of veto but this would not be for purpose of censuring or
                            criticizing. Also in our minds is near certainty that American inability
                            to follow <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would lead to seriously
                            critical stories from Taipei which we would be compelled to answer. It
                            is well to emphasize that one basis of our concern is a deterioration in

                            was made in light of existing world situation. This means we had reached
                            conclusion that further approaches toward Outer Mongolia at this time
                            would be detrimental to United States and free world interests. <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> veto of Outer Mongolia would not in
                            itself change our conclusion. While we could not make long-term
                            commitment affecting other times and circumstances we have no present

                            to prevent such development is directly related to preservation <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> position in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. You might also add in order to make important
                            distinction between official attitude of <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> and inevitable deterioration of public opinion in US
                            and other countries that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> considers

                                to preserve the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> position in the

                            veto Outer Mongolia. This does not mean that they consider <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> our satellite but they cannot
                            understand how <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> could throw such

                                by Chinese Embassy Political Counselor C.C. Lai, who was present.
                                (Department of State, Central Files, 303/10-461)</note> His account
                            is as follows:</p>
                        <p>Vice President Chen went back from Washington with a conviction that you
                            personally were committed to strong support of
                                <persName>Chiang</persName> and maintenance of this U.S. policy. He
                            found Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> “cagey.” This
                            account was persuasive to the Generalissimo, and it still colors his
                            whole approach to U.S. policy. Your first effort, after the Vice
                            President's visit, to shift <persName>Chiang</persName> on Outer
                            Mongolia was not effective, but it did not change his regard for you.
                            Indeed, he was getting the same arguments from all the professionals in
                            his own government, except the Foreign Minister. Then the Chinese
                            Government undertook a campaign of persuasion with the Brazzaville
                            group, and was discouraged to find no responsiveness whatsoever. As
                                <persName corresp="#p_YGKC1">Yeh</persName> put it, “The Africans
                            were interested in Mauritania and not at all in our problem.”</p>
                        <p>As the moment of choice came closer, and estimates of the voting became
                            more and more narrow, the Chinese professionals continued their pressure
                            on their own government, but without avail. Then last week the Secretary
                            of State had his stern conversations with <persName corresp="#p_TT1">Tsiang</persName> and the Foreign Minister in New York. <persName corresp="#p_YGKC1">Yeh</persName> reports that these conversations
                            deeply shook the Generalissimo. I think myself that the Secretary is
                            probably right in his belief that this shaking is what has moved
                                <persName>Chiang</persName> to his present apparent willingness to
                            reconsider the veto. The Secretary said that if the division persisted,
                            it might affect the “basic relationships” of the two countries. This
                            phrase above all others is what led <persName>Chiang</persName> to his
                            series of anguished questions to <persName corresp="#p_DEF1">Drumright</persName>.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_YGKC1">Yeh</persName> said to me in the strongest
                            terms that a message of friendliness and encouragement from you might
                            well be decisive, and I told him that you had asked me to get in touch
                            with him precisely to deliver such a message. I made it clear that there
                            was no difference in policy between you and the Secretary, and that you
                            associated yourself with his estimate of the seriousness of the
                            situation. But I also said that neither you nor Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>
                            <pb n="146" xml:id="pg_146" facs="0182"/>had any intention of shifting
                            away from the basic treaty relation between our two countries, and I
                            went further by emphasizing your own great respect and regard for the
                            Generalissimo as a heroic figure, and your sense of close personal
                            partnership in purpose with him. I said that he could be assured that
                            our whole object in this affair was to prevent the admission of
                            Communist China for as long as possible, and that this seemed to us to
                            be in the common interest of our two countries. I said that you would
                            deeply regret any misunderstanding that might have occurred
                            inadvertently in any of our conversations, and I indicated that we would
                            hope to be able to work together more closely and without
                            misunderstandings if we could reconcile this particular difference over
                            Outer Mongolia.<note n="2" xml:id="d65fn2">According to Rosen's
                                memorandum cited in <ref target="#d65fn1">footnote 1 above</ref>,
                                    <persName>Bundy</persName> stated that the President “now feels
                                that our initial, rather casual move toward recognition talks with
                                Outer Mongolia was ill-advised” and that the President had
                                instructed <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> “to use all possible
                                means to block admission of the Chinese Communists and protect the
                                    <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> in the United
                                Nations.”</note> All of this <persName corresp="#p_YGKC1">Yeh</persName> undertook to report to his government, and indeed I
                            said some of it at his suggestion in order to take advantage of his
                            obvious agreement with us that the thing to do is to use every
                            reasonable instrument to insure that the Generalissimo does, in fact,
                            change his mind.</p>
                        <p>I believe that this conversation serves the purpose which <persName corresp="#p_DEF1">Drumright</persName> has in mind in the attached
                            message, just received from Taipei.<note n="3" xml:id="d65fn3">

                                    <persName>Chiang</persName>, and that in return for a <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> commitment not to veto Outer

                            perhaps we could also send the special personal message as he suggests

                        <p>“In particular I want to make it clear that while Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> spoke for me in outlining the
                            difficulties we might face if we met defeat on the issue of Communist
                            China in the United Nations after a veto of Outer Mongolia, neither he
                            nor I would ever intend to state such a concern to a trusted ally in
                            tones of threat; we have meant rather to indicate clearly how forces
                            beyond our control might bring trouble to both our countries in such an
                            event. I believe that we can bridge our honorable differences on this
                            matter of Outer Mongolia—you by avoiding a veto, and we by avoiding any
                            new diplomatic initiative toward that country in the existing
                            circumstances—and if we can do these things in the light of the common
                            needs of the free people, we shall be fairly on the way to increased <pb n="148" xml:id="pg_148" facs="0184"/>effectiveness together, an

                            means to bar Mongolia, will be obliged by constitution to submit

                            explaining reversal to officialdom, armed forces and public. If not
                            handled adequately and properly, he said government will be endangered,
                            morale sapped and will and purpose of government and people dissipated.
                            He said it is particularly important to preserve idea government is not
                            retreating from fundamental policy (mainland recovery) or weakening in
                            its determination to oppose communism to end.</p>
                        <p>He added that his task is painful and onerous. Only two men can put it
                            across—President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> and
                            himself. It was this conviction which was behind instruction he

                            Armed with such a statement, <persName>Chiang</persName> said he
                            believed he could carry it with Legislative Yuan and public opinion;
                            without it, he would face serious trouble. <persName>Chiang</persName>
                            indicated that if President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> would issue such a supporting statement he would
                            be prepared to forego veto. Left unsaid but plainly implied was
                            impression he could not go ahead without supporting statement.</p>

                                inform Hsu that a public statement on the Chinese representation
                                issue did not appear necessary or desirable at that time; statements
                                of U.S. support had been made as recently as the joint statement

                            Acting Foreign Minister Hsu. However, President insisted that only a
                            fresh statement from President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> would suffice for his purposes. I then said
                            perhaps Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName>
                            could make some such statement in SC when Mongolian issue considered,
                            but he said this would not be sufficient.</p>
                        <p>In face of <persName>Chiang</persName>'s adamant position, I then told
                            him I would report to Washington. He asked that his views be passed
                            President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Comment: There is no doubt that <persName>Chiang</persName> is faced with
                            a troublesome predicament even if he does embroider on it to a certain
                            extent. He desperately wants statement from President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> on which he can pin his defense
                            of volte-face. He also wants JFK's assurances as reassurance to Chinese
                            people that admission of OM this year will not be followed by that of
                            Red China next year. I concede that this argument has substance and I
                            agree that a carefully worded statement from JFK could be helpful in
                            solving his dilemma.</p>
                        <p>If requested statement is not forthcoming, possibility exists that
                                <persName>Chiang</persName> will refuse to go ahead on Mongolia.
                            Consequently, it is my judgment that we should in this case stretch a
                            point and try to meet his request.</p>

                            opposed to the entry of Communist China into the United Nations and

                                substance of telegram 237 to Hsu, the latter expressed the view that
                                it would not satisfy President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName>, who had sent new instructions to <persName corresp="#p_SC1">Shen</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_YGKC1">Yeh</persName> directing them to press for

                                neither appropriate nor necessary for the President to go beyond the
                                terms used in telegram 237, and telegram 240 to Taipei informed
                                    <persName corresp="#p_DEF1">Drumright</persName>, “High quarters

                            are collecting support on the issue of the “important question,” and
                            mention of the Security Council or of the veto would both weaken that
                            support and suggest some fear that we might lose in our current
                            effort.</p>
                        <p>The President wishes, however, to extend once more to President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> and through him to all

                            Communist China and to sustain the position of the Republic of China
                            both in the United Nations and in the international community.</p>

                        <p>As you know, the Chinese delegation at the United Nations has already
                            begun to seek assurances from the Brazzaville group of support in the
                            event that the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> withdraws its veto of
                            Outer Mongolia. These soundings have produced wide African support for
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> on ChiRep issue but if after
                            such conversations the veto of Outer Mongolia were to be reasserted, the
                            effect would be most damaging. Thus it may be useful to suggest that
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>, having begun to change its
                            course, can now reassert veto only at a still higher price to itself and
                            to us. This last point should perhaps be made indirectly to others,
                            rather than to President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName>
                            himself. It should in no way be presented as a threat from <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>.</p>

                        <p>The Chinese representation issue was discussed at White House daily staff
                            meetings on October 9, 10, and 11, 1961, each of which was recorded in a
                            memorandum for the record by Colonel Julian J. Ewell of the White House
                            staff. His October 9 memorandum records the discussion of the subject as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p>“Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> mentioned the divergency of approach
                            between <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> and the
                            Administration (I think here he means the State Department) on the

                            year. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> seems to be
                            working to smooth the way for the ChiCom to become members with the U.S.
                            gaining as much political advantage as possible, whereas the
                            Administration policy seems to be to keep them out. The President,
                            regardless of any personal views he may have, probably cannot afford to
                            be officially associated with a two China idea. This was followed by a
                            long discussion of how the Berlin and Chinese Communist situations are
                            somewhat the same, i.e., how far do you go in recognizing an existing
                            fact? It was also noted that the Chinese Nationalists seem to have
                            exposed to public scrutiny their more flexible position on the Outer
                            Mongolia situation.” (National Defense University, <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> Papers, Box 24, Daily Staff

                        <p>The relevant portion of Ewell's October 10 memorandum reads as

                            decided on a flexible attitude. Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> remarked
                            that the Nationalists evidently want us to agree to veto ChiCom entry

                            the Nationalists in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. Mr.
                                <persName>Bundy</persName>, possibly acting as the devil's advocate,
                            advanced the thought that a U.S. veto might not be a bad idea, that we
                            are gradually getting into a situation where we will have to veto some
                            matters and we might as well do it on an issue where the President could
                            make a move which would be popular with a large element of public
                            opinion. I really didn't follow this discussion in all its turns and
                            twists.” (Ibid.)</p>

                            who has been called back for consultation.” (Ibid.)</p>

                            President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> would best save
                            the Chinese Government's situation by including in his reply to a

                            by the United States in the Security Council if necessary to prevent the
                            admission of Communist China; (2) if the Chinese position on Outer

                            statement a reference to the United States veto of Communist China, the
                            Chinese Government will not change its original instructions to its
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Delegation on the Outer Mongolia
                            issue—that is, the Chinese Delegation would veto Outer Mongolia if there
                            was no other way to prevent Outer Mongolia's admission to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>; and (4) the Chinese Government would not
                            want to place the US Government or President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> in any difficulty but hopes that President
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> can consider the need
                            for the requested reference in his press conference statement in order
                            to save the face of President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> and the Chinese Government.</p>
                        <p>A subsequent telegram received by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YGKC1">Yeh</persName> from Vice President Chen this afternoon instructs
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YGKC1">Yeh</persName> to assure the
                            State Department and, if possible, the White House that the position
                            taken by the Chinese Government on Outer Mongolia has nothing to do with
                            its attitude toward President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>, which remains one of friendliness and respect.
                            The Chinese Government's position, this message states, has been taken
                            entirely for internal reasons. This message also expressed the hope that
                            President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> can suspend
                            what he is prepared to say at the press conference on October 11 because
                            what he has prepared would not improve the position of the Government in
                            Taipei.</p>
                        <p>We have considered carefully once again the Chinese request in light of
                            the foregoing. We have concluded that it would not be desirable for the
                            United States to make a press statement of the kind requested by the
                            Chinese. There are two principal reasons supporting this conclusion.</p>
                        <p>First, such a statement would tend to establish the premise that the
                            United States had already suffered two defeats: (1) our proposals in the
                            General Assembly had not received the required support and (2) the
                            United States does not have seven affirmative votes for a proposal which
                            it favors in the Security Council. The fact that the new Administration
                            would have found it necessary to make such a statement would be regarded
                            as defeatist and help to generate this kind of an atmosphere in the
                            General Assembly.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, an indication by the United States of its intention to use the
                            veto to oppose the admission of Red China to the United Nations would
                            seriously undermine our present tactical plan at the General Assembly
                            designed to establish the precedent that any change in the Chinese
                            representation question is an “important one” under the Charter and
                            providing for the establishment of a committee to make recommendations
                            on this and related questions. A United States statement of intention to
                            use the veto in this way would tend to preclude in the eyes of a number
                            of delegations a possible recommendation by the study committee in favor
                            of a two China solution. Our study committee would then be conceived of
                            not as a serious study proposal designed to make constructive
                            recommendations, <pb n="154" xml:id="pg_154" facs="0190"/>but rather as
                            an empty one-year moratorium gimmick. It would not be viewed as a
                            serious proposal, and therefore our statement would tend to diminish
                            considerably the voting support we can hopefully expect.<note n="2" xml:id="d70fn2">
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> met with <persName corresp="#p_YGKC1">Yeh</persName> on October 11 and stated that
                                there were two objections to a public reference to a possible U.S.
                                veto on Chinese representation. First, it would be an empty gesture,
                                if the issue arose in a framework in which the veto could be used,
                                the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would also have the veto;
                                second, and more important, it would imply that “the jig is up in
                                the General Assembly.” (Memorandum of conversation, October 11;

                        <p>The President is prepared to give private reassurance to the
                            Generalissimo that if at any time a U.S. veto is what will be effective
                            in preventing Chinese Communist entry into the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, the United States will use that veto. This assurance,
                            however, must be kept wholly private for the powerful reason that public
                            disclosure of such a U.S. pledge at this time would be deeply damaging
                            to the common cause at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. There we
                            are debating on the important question issue and we will lose many
                            votes—and also indicate fear of defeat—if there is any public discussion
                            of a veto.</p>
                        <p>The President wants this assurance conveyed to
                                <persName>Chiang</persName> in the most effective way and by the
                            best possible person. On the evidence of recent days I am inclined to
                            yourself or to <persName corresp="#p_YGKC1">George Yeh</persName> who
                            has been extraordinarily <pb n="155" xml:id="pg_155" facs="0191"/>helpful and is now returning for consultation. Suggest urgently you
                            consult with him and then decide how to communicate the President's
                            assurance.</p>
                        <p>We recognize that what President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> now faces is a domestic political problem, in
                            which private assurances may not be useful. But we are completely
                            persuaded that any public statement mentioning the veto would be
                            intolerably destructive of his purposes and ours alike.</p>
                        <p>We leave it to you to decide after discussion with <persName corresp="#p_YGKC1">Yeh</persName> whether the President's assurance
                            could be conveyed in such a way as to allow President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> to use it privately with reliable
                            key figures. But there should be no leak, and this Government would have
                            to deny any rumors about reassurance on the veto, in order to protect
                            its position at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>You will note that the President does not promise a veto in all
                            circumstances. This is because our best experts report that in some
                            circumstances, such as a straight credentials vote; a veto would not be
                            possible. Thus, in fact, the veto is not the cure-all that
                                <persName>Chiang</persName> appears to think it is. The point of our
                            assurance is that the President will use whatever weapons seem likely to
                            work, including the veto, and you may put the matter in this way if it
                            seems more persuasive.</p>
                        <p>The President has great trust in you and wishes to leave you free to
                            convey these assurances.</p>
                        <p>The State Department is informed, but Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DEF1">Drumright</persName> is not, and at this stage we
                            prefer that he not be included unless you find it urgent for reasons not
                            apparent here.</p>

                                private assurances would persuade <persName>Chiang</persName> to

                        </p>
                        <p>After consultations with <persName corresp="#p_YGKC1">George
                                Yeh</persName> and many hours talk 14 October with <persName corresp="#p_CC2">Chiang Ching-kuo</persName> who was constantly
                            referring substance to Gimo we hammered out a draft of proposed
                            confidential understanding between President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> and President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> which Gimo has seen and will agree to if advised
                            it is acceptable to President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>.</p>
                        <p>2. Draft understanding is verbatim as follows:</p>
                        <p>A. US will not vote for admission of Outer Mongolia to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>B. President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> will at early
                            opportune time to be agreed issue public statement as follows:</p>
                        <p>“The United States has always considered the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> the only rightful government representing China and has
                            always given full support to the position and to all the rights of that
                            government in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. Therefore the
                            United States firmly opposes the entry of the ChiComs into the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> or into any of the components of the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.”</p>
                        <p>C. President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> will give
                            President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> the following
                            private assurance through diplomatic channels:</p>
                        <p>“I wish to assure you that if at any time a US veto is necessary and will
                            be effective in preventing Chinese Communist entry into the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, the US will use that veto.”</p>
                        <p>This assurance will be given with the explicit understanding that it must
                            be kept wholly private since public disclosure of such a pledge at this
                            time would adversely affect the common US-<gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> interest in preserving the free world position in the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and keeping the ChiComs out of
                            that organization.</p>
                        <pb n="157" xml:id="pg_157" facs="0193"/>
                        <p>D. The <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> will not use the veto against
                            Outer Mongolia's admission to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>3. If you advise me these four points are acceptable to President
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> then Gimo will invite
                            me for private conference where he will definitely commit himself to
                            this reversal of position on Outer Mongolia. Strongly urge approval of
                            wording on public statement as this is by far most innocuous of many
                            formulations discussed. It seems to me reiteration of technical
                            juridical position of US on ChiRep issue.</p>
                        <p>4. Gimo says he expects great local political difficulties including
                            necessity Prime Minister to resign. Gimo will have big convincing job to
                            do. Therefore requests one week's time for this job between US public
                            statement and resumption <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Security
                            Council consideration Outer Mongolia. If draft proposal approved by two
                            Presidents public statement should be made soon thereafter providing
                            only Gimo is informed of timing in advance via this channel.</p>
                        <p>5. Gimo says private assurance should not be in form of letter because in
                            China this would imply lack of trust between two correspondents. In fact
                            Gimo says he is willing approve this difficult change in <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> policy only because he has great
                            confidence in friendship of President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> and wishes build close personal understanding
                            between two men. Suggest private assurance be delivered orally by
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DEF1">Drumright</persName> as
                            diplomatic message from President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>.</p>
                        <p>6. Since now have Gimo's concurrence in principle will brief Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_DEF1">Drumright</persName> at earliest
                            opportunity in accordance your authorization received today.<note n="2" xml:id="d72fn2">

                                the Supplement.</note> for the record verbatim text my
                            presentation.</p>
                        <p>2. President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> responded as
                            anticipated that his policy views on the points covered are identical
                            with those of President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>.
                            Said he appreciated <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>'s
                            personal intervention in matter and had full confidence these policy
                            undertakings are in common interest. Noted he expects gravest political
                            difficulties in carrying out this policy reversal but will personally
                            see that it is done properly.</p>
                        <p>3. My presentation included as footnote the following: “President
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> observes that the
                            U.S. will not vote for admission unless circumstances make it clear that
                            it somehow would be essential to the success of this whole maneuver in
                            support of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>.” Gimo said he hoped
                            U.S. would not find it necessary to vote for admission Outer Mongolia
                            and in any case trusts President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> would give him prior warning if this is
                            proposed.</p>
                        <p>4. The Gimo asked me to tell President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> that he desperately needed one week to ten days
                            to reverse <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> political stand on Outer
                            Mongolia after President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>'s public statement and before vote in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Security Council. Suggested delegations
                            at <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> work out this timing.</p>
                        <pb n="159" xml:id="pg_159" facs="0195"/>
                        <p>5. Gimo requested advance notice exact time of President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>'s public statement</p>
                        <p>6. Following background gives insight into <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> policy process. In my marathon talks with <persName corresp="#p_YGKC1">George Yeh</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CC2">Chiang Ching-kuo</persName> on 15 October it
                            emerged that Gimo had committed himself to me through his son but still
                            had not disclosed this fact to <persName corresp="#p_YGKC1">George
                                Yeh</persName> who still late on 15 Oct was discussing with me how
                            to persuade Gimo of points we had worked up and which already had been
                            sent to Washington. <persName corresp="#p_CC2">Chiang
                                Ching-kuo</persName> asked me not to give game away before final
                            approval from Washington. Obviously Gimo was hoping <persName corresp="#p_YGKC1">George Yeh</persName>'s protracted arguments
                            would serve to persuade other top officials that what Gimo had already
                            decided was right. Interestingly <persName corresp="#p_YGKC1">George
                                Yeh</persName> said by late 15 October he was convinced big majority
                            responsible leaders already persuaded Gimo should not use veto on Outer
                            Mongolia.</p>
                        <p>7. Gimo requested me not to tell any Chinese that this understanding was
                            worked out through me and <persName corresp="#p_CC2">Chiang
                                Ching-kuo</persName>. Evidently he felt this politically undesirable
                            for variety reasons but his stated reason was he highly valued this

                            President:</p>
                        <p>At earliest opportunity you should seek meeting with President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> and inform him orally of this
                            private assurance from me. “I wish to assure you that if at any time a
                            US veto is necessary and will be effective in preventing Chinese
                            Communist entry into the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, the US will
                            use that veto.” You should tell him that this assurance is given
                            privately because of the unfavorable impact that public disclosure would
                            have on our common position at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.
                            This is my policy, and President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> is entitled to know it, but any public use of
                            this assurance would force a diplomatic denial here.</p>
                        <p>You should also inform President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> that I now plan to make a strong public statement
                            of support for <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> in following terms Wednesday, Oct. 18.
                            “The US has always considered the Government of the Republic of China
                            the only rightful government representing China and has always given
                            full support to the position and to all the rights of that government in
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. Therefore, the US firmly opposes
                            the entry of the Chinese Communists into the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> or into any of the components of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.”<note n="1" xml:id="d74fn1">Telegram 276

                        <p>A memorandum of October 18 from Representative to the United Nations
                                <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> to Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> objected to the proposed
                            public statement on Chinese representation. The first paragraph reads as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p>“The timing of this statement could not be worse. It could cause us acute
                            trouble in sustaining our good faith in asking for a study committee and
                            prejudice our chances of winning approval. It will be interpreted by
                            many as excluding the chance of a compromise policy next year, such as
                            the successor state approach. Others will interpret it, coming at this
                            time, as confirmation that our proposal for a study committee is
                            insincere and only a device to postpone. I will not comment here on
                            other possible effects on confidence in our leadership in the United
                            Nations.”</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> suggested a revision of
                            the language of the second sentence of the statement and suggested a
                            supplementary statement which could be used to explain and enlarge upon
                            the President's statement. (Ibid.)</p>
                        <p>Handwritten notes prepared by <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> for a meeting with the President criticize the
                            “deal with <persName>Chiang</persName>” on the veto as unnecessary,
                            against <persName>Chiang</persName>'s own interests, and “grossly
                            dishonest”. One point reads, “Diminishes chances of a compromise pol.
                            next year—2 China policy.” A handwritten notation indicates that
                                <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> discussed the
                            subject with <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> at Newport,
                            Rhode Island, on October 22. No record of the meeting has been found.

                        <p><persName>Bundy</persName>'s memorandum to <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> cited above also stated that he thought there
                            was one “loose end” in the communications through <persName corresp="#p_CRS1">Cline</persName>. He attached a draft cable to
                                <persName corresp="#p_CRS1">Cline</persName>, which he intended to
                            check with <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>. The draft message
                            pointed out that the Chinese representation question might not present
                            itself in a form subject to the veto, that the veto of one proposal
                            might result in another proposal that was still less desirable but not
                            clearly subject to the veto, and that the use of the veto <pb n="162" xml:id="pg_162" facs="0198"/>might therefore not be effective in all
                            cases. It stated that President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> wanted to be sure that President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> did not mistake his assurance for
                            an unconditional guarantee, and it suggested that <persName corresp="#p_CRS1">Cline</persName> consult with Ambassadors
                                <persName corresp="#p_YGKC1">Yeh</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DEF1">Drumright</persName> as to whether this was
                            sufficiently clear to President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> or whether “the danger of misunderstanding and
                            consequent breakdown of partnership next year” was grave enough to make
                            further action necessary. The memorandum bears a handwritten note
                            stating that at <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s request the
                            draft message was not sent.</p>
                        <p>On October 25 the United Nations Security Council recommended the
                            admission of the Mongolian People's Republic to the United Nations by a
                            vote of 9-0 with 1 abstention (United States). The Republic of China did
                            not participate in the voting. (U.N. doc. S/4968) Mongolia was admitted
                            to the United Nations by General Assembly Resolution 1630 (XVI), adopted
                            by acclamation on October 27. The Republic of China did not participate
                            in the voting.</p>
                        <p>On December 1 Australia, Colombia, Italy, Japan, and the United States
                            introduced a draft resolution deciding that any proposal to change the
                            representation of China was an important question. The resolution was
                            adopted on December 15 as Resolution 1668 (XVI) by a vote of 61 to 34

                        <p>U.S. POLICY TOWARD CHINA</p>
                        <p>[Here follow a table of contents and 111 pages of text.]</p>
                        <p>V. Recommendations</p>
                        <p>Although a variety of considerations converge in some of the following
                            recommendations, they have been arranged, for purposes of convenience,
                            in related groups.</p>
                        <pb n="163" xml:id="pg_163" facs="0199"/>
                        <p>A. Basic Strategy</p>
                        <p>(1) We should pursue toward mainland China the general policy of seeking:
                            (a) to hold ajar the door to a more satisfactory relationship with the
                            US, (b) to mute our shared hostility, (c) to transfer to Communist China
                            the onus for it, and (d) at the same time to build more effective
                            barriers to the expansion in Asia of the Sino-Soviet bloc.</p>
                        <p>B. Manifestations of a Humanitarian Concern for the Chinese People</p>
                        <p>(2) We should proceed to lift the embargo on exports to Communist China
                            of foodgrains (including flour) and medicines, and consider, in the
                            light of other recommendations contained herein, whether trade with
                            Communist China should not be put on a comparable basis with trade with
                            the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>(3) If recommendation (2) is accepted in whole or part, we should adopt a
                            policy of giving bunkering facilities at least to all ships coming to
                            our ports with cargo for Communist China which is restricted to
                            foodstuffs (or other items from which we lift the embargo).</p>
                        <p>(4) We should explain changes in the embargo, and the modification of
                            bunkering restrictions, in terms of putting concern for the welfare of
                            the Chinese people above our differences with the regime which rules
                            them.</p>
                        <p>(5) When that may appear warranted by a situation of more acute privation
                            on the mainland than now exists there, and provided Communist China has
                            been abstaining from new commitments to export foodstuffs from its own
                            stocks, we should extend an offer of foodstuffs to Communist China on a
                            grant basis. Any supply of US grain to Communist China should be
                            accompanied, in the unlikely event that it is accepted, by safeguards
                            against subsequent Chinese Communist charges about its suitability for
                            human consumption.</p>
                        <p>(6) We should actively seek to share with Communist China information
                            about medical advances likely to be helpful to the Chinese people.</p>
                        <p>(7) We should supply consistently, by radio or otherwise, weather
                            information including typhoon warnings derived from our weather
                            satellites.</p>
                        <p>C. Removal of Unnecessary Provocations</p>
                        <p>(8) We should review US and <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> special
                            operations against the Chinese mainland and thereafter desist ourselves,
                            and try to keep the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> from carrying
                            out, ones which we conclude are likely to be more provocative than is
                            justified by the anticipated return.</p>
                        <p>(9) We should review and revise US practices to ensure that our planes
                            and ships do not without sufficient reasons, based on intelligence needs
                            and operational requirements, penetrate Chinese Communist territorial
                            waters and airspace.</p>
                        <pb n="164" xml:id="pg_164" facs="0200"/>
                        <p>D. Negotiation and Communication with Communist China</p>
                        <p>(10) We should continue the Ambassadorial talks.</p>
                        <p>(11) We should continue the policy of non-recognition of Communist
                            China.</p>
                        <p>(12) We should determine what conditions we would set for recognition of
                            Communist China and be prepared to restudy the question of recognition
                            whenever altered circumstances, such as ones involving changes in the
                            actions and apparent objectives of the Chinese Communist regime, and its
                            own attitude toward diplomatic relations with us, may appear to justify
                            such reconsideration.</p>
                        <p>(13) We should continue the present policy of attempting to keep
                            Communist China out of the United Nations.</p>
                        <p>(14) We should initiate a study having as its aims the formulation of
                            alternate objectives to be sought when and if it may become apparent
                            that our aim of keeping Communist China out of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> is no longer realistic, the tactics
                            required to achieve those objectives, and the best timing for the
                            initiation of the relevant efforts.</p>
                        <p>(15) We should consider the inclusion of Communist China in disarmament
                            negotiations importantly involving its military capabilities if and when
                            it may appear that substantive progress with the Soviet Union is
                            likely.</p>
                        <p>(16) We should explore the feasibility of including Communist China in
                            case of renewed negotiations for a nuclear test ban despite the
                            likelihood that its response would be negative.</p>
                        <p>(17) We should endeavor to assure that any invitation to Communist China
                            to participate in negotiations for disarmament or a nuclear test ban be
                            portrayed in terms such that the onus for any refusal to participate
                            would rest on the Chinese Communists.</p>
                        <p>(18) We should avoid hasty responses to Communist Chinese statements, no
                            matter how provocative, as well as a shrill tone and any unnecessary
                            vituperation in our own statements.</p>
                        <p>(19) Without exerting undue pressure, we should continue to seek access
                            to Communist China by US correspondents and, within the limits set by
                            concern for the safety of Americans in a country where we cannot afford
                            them diplomatic protection, pursue the objective of gaining access to
                            Communist China for other qualified American observers, scientists,
                            scholars and, if trade is resumed, businessmen.</p>
                        <p>(20) We should utilize potentially useful Chinese Communist declarations,
                            such as the self-imposed restrictions inherent in the five principles
                            enunciated at Bandung, in contexts which may permit us to mobilize
                            support for holding the Chinese Communists to them.</p>
                        <pb n="165" xml:id="pg_165" facs="0201"/>
                        <p>E. Military and Nuclear</p>
                        <p>(21) We should increase the non-nuclear military capabilities we maintain
                            in the western Pacific area, including capabilities related to
                            counter-guerrilla operations.</p>
                        <p>(22) We should develop and covertly disseminate in Asia such propaganda
                            as may tend to reduce the impact which will be made there by the first
                            Chinese Communist nuclear explosion, and to lessen its contribution to
                            the belief that Communism provides a superior blueprint for national
                            development.</p>
                        <p>(23) We should avoid statements or actions which unnecessarily contribute
                            to the view that Communist China's military strength and expected
                            acquisition of nuclear weapons make it too powerful for its neighbors to
                            resist.</p>
                        <p>(24) We should promote and support Japanese and Indian leadership of and
                            assistance to other Asian states in the field of peaceful uses of atomic
                            energy and materiels, and widest possible recognition of that
                            leadership.</p>
                        <p>(25) We should ascertain what bilateral measures, such as training
                            indigenous forces in the use of US nuclear weapons and stationing
                            nuclear missiles in the respective countries, or in the case of Japan
                            perhaps eventually on ships at sea, seem feasible and best adapted to
                            reducing Communist China's opportunities to use nuclear blackmail
                            against its Asian neighbors.</p>
                        <p>(26) We should endeavor to turn the prospective Chinese Communist
                            acquisition of a nuclear capability to positive account as the rationale
                            for rapprochements between Japan and the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>, and of India with Pakistan, and their closer mutual
                            involvement in such contexts as integrated air-defenses of the
                            Korea-Japan area and of the Indian sub-continent.</p>
                        <p>(27) We should investigate the alternatives to stationing nuclear weapons
                            on US-held bases close to the Chinese mainland, such as their transfer
                            to US-held territories farther to the east.</p>
                        <p>(28) We should endeavor to convert pressures which may develop against
                            our retention of bases in countries such as Japan to pressures for the
                            development of independent indigenous military capabilities, and
                            assumption of corresponding responsibility in respect of regional
                            defense arrangements, as necessary prerequisites for any phasing
                            downward of the military presence of the US.</p>
                        <p>F. Protecting the States on Communist China's Periphery</p>
                        <p>(29) We should take steps designed to ensure that the requirements for
                            preventing Thailand and other threatened Asian states from being
                            successfully subjected to the Maoist cycle of infiltration and
                            insurrection are analyzed, that the results are embodied in
                            country-plans, and that <pb n="166" xml:id="pg_166" facs="0202"/>they
                            are met through the efforts of the threatened states, the US, and other
                            cooperating countries.</p>
                        <p>(30) We should, as a matter of urgency, determine what change we should
                            promote in the international relationships of the mainland states of
                            southeast Asia, including relationships toward each other, in the
                            interests of their survival in the face of Communist China's growing
                            power and the threat to them of ambiguous forms of Communist
                            aggression.</p>
                        <p>(31) We should promote widest possible international recognition that
                            bloc instigation and support of internal violence of the type now
                            underway in Southeast Asia constitutes aggression directed at the
                            national independence of the states involved, and endeavor to translate
                            this recognition into appropriate inhibitory international action both
                            within and outside the United Nations.</p>
                        <p>(32) We should, starting in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1963,
                            program for the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> economic aid of
                            kinds and in amounts which appear required to put and keep it on the
                            road to economic viability, and be prepared to accept the risks inherent
                            in phasing down the size of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces
                            to levels which can be <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            supported.</p>
                        <p>(33) We should use our influence on and aid to Taiwan as means not only
                            of protecting that island through our alliance with the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>, but also of progressively promoting
                            the timely emergence there of government based on popular consent and
                            minimizing our over-identification with the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> as it is now constituted and motivated.</p>
                        <p>(34) We should work, within the limits which the need for a continued
                            useful relationship with the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> will
                            allow, for the damping-down of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>-Chinese Communist civil war and the evacuation of the
                            offshore islands, considering as a first step seeking a major reduction
                            in the garrisons on purely military grounds.</p>
                        <p>(35) We should, in dealing with <persName>Chiang</persName>, accept the
                            risks inherent in pressing for change, in place of those which are
                            implicit in letting the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> pursue
                            present courses, make appropriate elements of our aid conditional so it
                            can be used as a lever in pressing for change, and time pressures for
                            major specific changes so they occur in the context of maximum assurance
                            of continued over-all US support.</p>
                        <p>(36) We should prepare for the contingency that Communist China may
                            embark on a more aggressive but still sub-belligerent course, which
                            might both require and make internationally acceptable the application
                            to it of maximum pressure short of war, by a study exploring what forms
                            of pressure might be applied, evaluating how much each element might
                            contribute, and estimating how effective the totality might be if all
                            acceptable components were combined.</p>

                        <p>G. The Sino-Soviet Split</p>
                        <p>(37) We should continue study of the measures we might best take in order
                            to take advantage of the present Sino-Soviet split in the interests of
                            widening it further or of otherwise exploiting it.</p>

                        <p>At the 493d meeting of the National Security Council on November 15,
                            1961, Director of Central Intelligence <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen
                                W. Dulles</persName> and Deputy Director for Intelligence <persName corresp="#p_AR1">Robert Amory</persName> briefed the Council on
                            Sino-Soviet relations and the situation in China, and there was some
                            related discussion. A record of the meeting, probably drafted by the
                            Vice President's military aide Howard L. Burris, describes this portion
                            of the meeting as follows:</p>
                        <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> opened the meeting
                            with the reading and discussion of a prepared report on the
                            Soviet-Chinese rift. Following the presentation the President asked for
                            the basis of the current impasse between Russia and Albania. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> replied that it was
                            obviously ideological since Albania was one of the smallest countries in
                            Europe with the lowest per <pb n="168" xml:id="pg_168" facs="0204"/>capita income and possibilities and potential in general. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_AR1">Amory</persName> then discussed the
                            current food and agricultural shortages in Communist China and brought
                            out the fact that Chinese advances have been generally retarded across
                            the board because of crop shortages. The deficient diet has tended to
                            diminish efficiency in other fields of endeavor. Production generally is
                            on the decline. A brief outline of the size and disposition of Chinese
                            armed forces was given. The President then asked what routes of movement
                            are available for these troops from China to North Viet Nam. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_AR1">Amory</persName> pointed out and
                            described the condition of railway and roads of access and cited the
                            generally inadequate aspects of these avenues. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> cautioned that it should not be
                            assumed that the Chinese setbacks as well as the ideological rift were
                            such that the Soviets and Chinese would not be able nor willing to
                            engage jointly any nation which threatened Communist interests.”

                        <p>I am addressing the three of you on a matter which requires your
                            immediate and urgent attention. The issue, which is one on which my
                            ideas are conclusively formed, involves the continuation of a series of
                            adventures launched under the past Administration [<hi rend="italic">1-1/2 lines of source text not declassified</hi>]. It keeps going
                            an activity started by the last Administration but about which that
                            Administration had manifested sufficient uneasiness to halt. The reasons
                            for the operation, which in my view were never sufficient, have
                            diminished in value and now depend in part, as in the case of Cuba, on
                            the fact that men have been trained, action is under way and now must be
                            continued and in part on intelligence yield.</p>
                        <p>History</p>
                        <p>The history of the operation extends back over several years. At the time
                            of the ChiCom takeover in Tibet, refugees came out which included quite
                            a few able-bodied men. A group of these were taken to a special
                            establishment [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>] where they were trained in guerrilla tactics.
                                [<hi rend="italic">5-1/2 lines of source text not declassified</hi>]
                            The stated purpose was to prevent the consolidation of the hold of the
                            Chinese on Tibet, draw off Chinese resources into the insurrection there
                            and keep in the public eye the image of Chinese aggression in the
                            area.</p>
                        <p>At the time of the U-2 attempt in the summer of 1960 President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> became aware or conscious of

                            hope has of course disappeared. It was once thought that the operations
                            would keep the Chinese from consolidating their hold on Tibet. Of this
                            there is no chance. The operations cover a few square miles of an
                            incredibly vast area. Finally, it is argued that by keeping alive the
                            resistance, the Chinese aggression in Tibet is kept before world
                            opinion. Again, the fact that this is confined to a few acres destroys
                            this case. And it is further destroyed because little news leaks out
                            even of these operations. Finally, it must be urged that there is

                            affected by the contingency of an open break in relations between the
                            Chinese and Soviet Communist Parties.</p>
                        <pb n="173" xml:id="pg_173" facs="0209"/>
                        <p>Conclusions</p>
                        <p>1. Communist China almost certainly does not intend to attempt the open
                            military conquest of any other Far Eastern country during the period of
                            this estimate. Communist China's leaders believe that they can
                            eventually achieve their objectives in the area at far less cost and
                            risk through the techniques of Communist political warfare. When Peiping
                            believes the circumstances are right, it will endeavor to supplement the
                            more conventional forms of political warfare with guerrilla and
                            terrorist action by indigenous forces, supported and guided by Peiping.
                            (Paras. 23, 25)</p>
                        <p>2. In any case, the Communist Chinese will seize every opportunity to
                            undermine US standing and to generate anti-American feeling in the Far
                            East. They will strive to promote discontent and instability in the
                            pro-Western countries of the area. (Para. 24)</p>
                        <p>3. Peiping has no compunctions about openly using its military forces to
                            extend its control when it can do so with little or no risk. It will
                            continue its refusal to renounce the use of force for the seizure of
                            Taiwan and the offshore islands, but we believe that concern over
                            retaliation by the US will deter it from attempting a military conquest
                            of Taiwan or the offshore islands during at least the period of this
                            estimate. However, the Chinese might undertake limited military action
                            in the strait area to test Nationalist Chinese defenses and to probe US
                            determination or to call world attention to what it terms “the danger to
                            peace caused by the US occupation of a part of China's territory.”
                            (Paras. 26-27)</p>
                        <p>4. Peiping's reluctance to launch a military invasion in the Far East
                            will almost certainly not prevent it from reacting vigorously to any US
                            or SEATO action which Peiping believed threatened its security. For
                            example, if SEATO (or US armed forces alone) came to the defense of Laos
                            or South Vietnam, Peiping's reaction would probably be to increase its
                            aid to the Pathet Lao and the North Vietnamese while deploying
                            substantial Chinese regular forces along its own southern border. In the
                            more extreme situation where a SEATO or US action constituted a threat
                            to North Vietnam which the North Vietnamese forces could not counter,
                            the Chinese Communists would almost certainly intervene overtly with
                            their own forces;<note n="1" xml:id="d80fn1">Peiping's probable
                                reactions to a number of intermediate courses of US action in South

                            action appear to threaten the Communist position in northern Laos, the
                            Chinese Communists would probably intervene overtly with their own
                            forces. (Para. 28)</p>
                        <p>5. If Sino-Soviet relations were to deteriorate, for example to the
                            present level of Albanian-Soviet relations, Communist China's military
                                <pb n="174" xml:id="pg_174" facs="0210"/>capabilities would be
                            somewhat reduced and Peiping would have much less confidence that it
                            could count on the Soviet nuclear umbrella. Perhaps most important, such
                            an open Sino-Soviet break would also reduce Communist China's
                            capabilities for political warfare, at least in the short run. The very
                            foundations of communism would be shaken and Sino-Soviet rivalry for
                            dominant influence in the other Communist parties of Asia would have a
                            disruptive effect on these parties and would substantially weaken them
                            as instruments of subversion for the time being. (Paras. 30-31)</p>

                        <p>DEAR <persName>GEORGE</persName>: Your memorandum of November 3 to
                                <persName corresp="#p_BCA1">Chester Bowles</persName>
                            <note n="1" xml:id="d81fn1">This memorandum requested a statement of
                                policy concerning “overtures of food assistance to Red China.”
                                (Ibid., 893.03/11-361)</note> came at a time when we were actively
                            considering the question of foodstuffs for the people of mainland China.
                            The Chinese Communists have admitted to <persName corresp="#p_HVS1">Viscount</persName> Montgomery<note n="2" xml:id="d81fn2">British

                            1961 harvest will be disappointing for the third successive year. Thus
                            it would seem likely that Peiping's prospects for feeding its expanding
                            and already undernourished population may become very grim in the early
                            months of next year.</p>
                        <p>At Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BCA1">Bowles</persName>' request, a
                            statement of the recommended United States position was prepared in the
                            Department's Bureau of Far Eastern Affairs. A copy of that statement is
                                enclosed.<note n="3" xml:id="d81fn3">Not found attached; presumably
                                it was the statement of policy set forth in a November 21 memorandum
                                from <persName corresp="#p_MCWP1">McConaughy</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>, which <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> approved on December 6.</note>
                            As you will see, our salient conclusions are these: first, that there is
                            no change in the presumption <pb n="175" xml:id="pg_175" facs="0211"/>that the Chinese Communists will not ask for United States help and
                            would refuse it if offered; second, that the United States should not
                            take the initiative in offering such relief; third, that the United
                            States Government should not now prejudge its reaction in the unlikely
                            event that a Chinese Communist request is received, but that certain
                            important criteria as to whether to offer relief and the manner of doing
                            so can now be set forth.<note n="4" xml:id="d81fn4">The memorandum
                                stated that consideration should be given only to a firm, although
                                not necessarily public, Chinese request for food, only to the direct
                                supply of food as a humanitarian gesture rather than to a sale or
                                quasi-commercial arrangement, and only to an arrangement in which
                                relief foodstuffs would actually reach those in need.</note>

                        <p>I enclose also a copy of a telegram which we sent to Ambassador Everton
                            in Rangoon, in response to a suggestion which he relayed from U Nu to

                                proposal would “be bound to create an extremely sensitive political
                                problem for this country” and that “This consideration has added
                                force in a period when Peiping seems to be splitting even from
                                Moscow in pursuance of a more aggressive policy, and when our own
                                contacts with the Chinese Communist authorities show no inclination
                                or desire on their part to lessen the threat or reduce tensions in
                                the area. Southeast Asia is now exposed to a particularly vigorous

                        <p>In your meeting with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BCA1">Bowles</persName>
                            earlier this week you requested that I pass on my recollections of the
                            discussion that took place at the Secretary's Policy Planning Meeting on
                            January 2. The paper under discussion was “The Sino-Soviet Conflict and
                            U.S. Policy.”<note n="2" xml:id="d82fn2">Reference is to a December 19
                                draft prepared in the Policy Planning Council. It declared that the
                                Sino-Soviet conflict had reached a “critical stage,” that the basic
                                issue was one of supremacy within the Communist camp, that its
                                ultimate source lay in a clash of national interests, and that it
                                was likely to continue, perhaps until there was a “decisive break”
                                in the world Communist movement. (<persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> Library, <persName corresp="#p_TJCJ1">Thomson</persName> Papers, Box 15, Far East, Communist China,

                            are the major comments, gathered from my notes on the meeting:</p>
                        <p>1. The Secretary termed the paper a highly important document and asked
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> to make some
                            introductory comments.</p>
                        <p>2. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> said that the
                            Moscow-Peking split is clearly an historic and unprecedented
                            development; however, (a) no one knows what to do about it, and (b)
                            there is urgent need for a hard intelligence effort on the subject as we
                            have little knowledge of the Chinese agricultural situation, of
                            differences within the Chinese leadership, or of the impact of the split
                            on other Communist parties.</p>
                        <p>3. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> proposed (a) that the
                            Department arrange for the Council on Foreign Relations to put together
                            at once a study group on the 22nd Party Congress whose major aim would
                            be to examine, under this cover, the Sino-Soviet split; (b) that the
                            Department establish a study group within <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> on the same subject for the same purpose; and (c) that
                            we submit a sanitized version of the paper under discussion to Capitol
                            Hill for use by the Foreign Relations and Foreign Affairs Committee
                            chairmen. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> commented
                            that such studies were already under way, to some extent, at Harvard,
                            Columbia, and Brookings.</p>
                        <p>4. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> asked to what extent
                            the split involved a move toward the type of diversity we face within
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName> commented that <pb n="177" xml:id="pg_177" facs="0213"/>the evolving situation was not in fact
                            a parallel to the divisions that exist within <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>5. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> stressed the complex
                            implications of the split for U.S. policy. He stated that it was
                            essentially a favorable event for us, but in concrete situations it
                            posed a variety of new and difficult problems (e.g., Southeast
                            Asia).</p>
                        <p>6. There was a general discussion as to what constitutes a “complete
                            break,” and whether a complete break is what we want to bring about. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> said that we must be
                            careful not to build our intelligence effort around the concept of a
                            “break”; there are too many varieties of breaks possible; we need a
                            graduated system of analysis.</p>
                        <p>7. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TP1">Talbot</persName> noted the effects of
                            the deepening rift on bilateral conflicts in his region and elsewhere.
                            For instance, we see India moving somewhat closer to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> while Pakistan shows some signs of
                            accommodation with Communist China. The result, he said, will be
                            intensification of bilateral conflicts in many parts of the world. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_REE1">Rice</persName> agreed that global
                            competition between China and Russia would be an inevitable outgrowth of
                            the break.</p>
                        <p>8. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName> said the essence of
                            the quarrel is that the Russians have become the Mensheviks, while the
                            Chinese are Bolsheviks. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName> added that the serious implications of the
                            conflict are well understood by such orthodox leaders as Molotov: If you
                            start changing the ideology you inevitably end up by changing the
                            structure. Such a realization accounts for the opposition <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is encountering within the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>9. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CA1">Chayes</persName> said that,
                            historically, the break must be in our favor, as are all breaks in
                            monoliths. He raised the question of the rift's effect on Outer Mongolia
                            and the off-shore isles.</p>
                        <p>10. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> asserted that this
                            paper could be taken as a strong argument for establishing diplomatic
                            relations with Outer Mongolia.</p>
                        <p>11. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> discussed Yugoslav
                            interest in polycentrism within the bloc. The Sino-Soviet conflict
                            provides a temptation to Yugoslavia to “play the game” within the bloc;
                            but such activities tend to destroy the position the Yugoslavs have
                            built as a Communist neutral. In this regard, he pointed out that the
                            Yugoslavs are reestablishing relations with the Indian Communist
                            Party.</p>
                        <p>12. Assuming that we favor polycentrism, Mr. <persName>Martin</persName>
                            asked why we should consider providing any assistance at all to the
                            Chinese Communists. Economic adversity would tend to increase tensions
                            between Peiping and Moscow and therefore operates in our favor. Perhaps
                            we should aim to support right-wing deviationists (Tito) but not
                            left-wing deviationists (the Chinese).</p>
                        <pb n="178" xml:id="pg_178" facs="0214"/>
                        <p>13. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> agreed. He pointed out
                            that Peiping combines old-fashioned Chinese imperialism as well as
                            left-wing Communist deviationism.</p>
                        <p>14. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TRW1">Tubby</persName> suggested that, in
                            view of the break, we place more emphasis on our struggle against
                            Chinese nationalism and Russian nationalism rather than our struggle
                            against communism.</p>
                        <p>15. Mr. Harvey commented that there had been two types of Soviet attempts
                            to force their decisions on the Chinese: first, by making <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> party decisions binding on other
                            parties (rejected by the Chinese), and second by making Communist World
                            Congress decisions binding on other parties (the Chinese say such
                            decisions must be unanimous to be binding). As a result of these two
                            failures, Mr. Harvey said, the monolith no longer exists.</p>
                        <p>16. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said that this might
                            be true, but what if their objectives remain the same? Mr. Harvey
                            replied that their objectives are no longer the same.</p>
                        <p>17. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MGGC1">McGhee</persName> said that the West
                            is moving from diversity towards unity while the Communists are
                            disintegrating from a monolith into diversity. He added that the
                            resulting internal competition within the Communist system now acts as
                            an escape valve for energies that were originally focused entirely on
                            us.</p>
                        <p>18. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> said that there are
                            three elements of such competition within communism: (a) competition in
                            third countries through local Communist parties; (b) competition over
                            the central issue of who gets nuclear weapons and what type of control
                            is to be exercised over them (a national fight on degrees of sovereignty
                            similar to conflicts within <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>); and
                            (c) probable competition within the Chinese Communist hierarchy, which
                            is not likely to retain its present monolithic form as the old leaders
                            are replaced.</p>
                        <p>19. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> added that <gloss target="#t_INR1">INR</gloss> is preparing two relevant studies, one
                            on Chinese Communist leadership, and one on Chinese nuclear
                                capability.<note n="3" xml:id="d82fn3">Neither found.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>20. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MGGC1">McGhee</persName> said that the new
                            era of diversity affords us possibilities for leverage within Communist
                            parties outside of the bloc.</p>
                        <p>21. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> said that the paper
                            implies one major decision which may be forced on us any day now: what
                            do we do if <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> dies and there
                            is a crisis within the Chinese leadership? Do we give them a vision of
                            the possibility of better relations with us if they calm down? Or do we
                            buckle them in even more tightly with the Russians?<note n="4" xml:id="d82fn4">A marginal notation in <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>'s handwriting reads: “Stalin—'We can't
                                supply' capital needs”.</note>

                        <p>22. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said that we face two
                            immediate needs: (a) a review of possible <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> divergencies on specific issues that have arisen since
                            1950 (for instance, the Korean war negotiations); and (b) a study of the
                            rift's effect on post-Goa bilateral situations (such as the conflict
                            between Guatemala and Great Britain over British Honduras). He added
                            that we must be careful not to overemphasize Chinese Communist military
                            and economic power. The key question is “power where”? Relative Chinese
                            power on the North India border, for instance, is considerably less than
                            Chinese power elsewhere. Also, we must relate our evaluation to the
                            resources available and the jobs to be done. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> added that we should give some
                            attention to the tradition of the turnover of governments in China
                            throughout the centuries: for instance, what constitutes the Mandate of
                            Heaven, and when does a government lose it?<note n="5" xml:id="d82fn5">A

                                any more exactly [illegible] context”. Another reads: “Never before

                        <p>23. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_REE1">Rice</persName> responded that the
                            Mandate of Heaven will be lost when the party,<note n="6" xml:id="d82fn6">A marginal notation in <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>'s handwriting reads: “Party selects

                            to orders from the top. There is no evidence as yet of such a

                        <p>24. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> raised additional
                            questions regarding the possible recrudescence of Chinese warlordism and
                            regionalism. He felt that such factors should be studied in the

                        <p>It has been heartening to have new proof, in the adoption by the United
                            Nations General Assembly of the resolution concerning Tibet,<note n="2" xml:id="d83fn2">Resolution 1723 (XVI) was adopted by the General
                                Assembly on December 20 by a vote of 56 (including the United

                                    1961,</hi> pp. 1641-1642.</note> that most of the countries of
                            the world join in the condemnation of the brutality and oppression which
                            the Chinese Communists impose on the Tibetan people, and in the
                            conviction that the principle of self-determination should apply to the
                            people of Tibet.</p>
                        <p>The Chinese Communist authorities have publicly denounced the General
                            Assembly's adoption of the resolution concerning Tibet. They have taken
                            the position that “no foreign countries or international organizations,
                            the United Nations included, have any right to meddle” in any aspect of
                            the situation in Tibet. Their belligerence even toward countries which
                            they had previously described as friendly has been evident in recent
                            months. In these circumstances it will clearly not be easy to find
                            effective means of halting the Chinese Communists' actions against the
                            Tibetan people.</p>
                        <p>We are nevertheless determined to continue our efforts to help achieve a
                            just and peaceful solution of this tragic problem. We are also hopeful
                            that provisions may be expanded and improved for the assistance of those
                            Tibetans who have had to take refuge outside their homeland. Your

                        <p>This one is going to be quite a problem in 1962. Peiping's still acute
                            economic crisis, the deepening Sino-Soviet schism, the aging
                                <persName>Chiang</persName>'s own feel that the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>'s own position is eroding, and finally
                                <persName>Chiang</persName>'s continuing apprehensions over US
                            policy are all leading him to consider more and more a final gamble.

                        <p>Before fobbing <persName>Chiang</persName> off, let's at least consider
                            his case. Certainly Peiping is feebler than at any time since it
                            consolidated the 1947-49 revolution. It is obviously on its own, with
                            the Soviets using a slow-down if not cessation of economic and military
                            aid as a means to bring <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> back
                            into line. Food shortage continues into third year, and we recently had
                            good indications [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not

                            concluded that it could only be successful if there were a major
                            revolution in Red <pb n="182" xml:id="pg_182" facs="0218"/>China (even
                            though one initially regional in character), which
                                <persName>Chiang</persName> could support. The consensus to date has
                            been that this is unlikely, even in Red China's present desperate state.
                            But we must now ask ourselves whether <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> action might not precipitate such a revolution.</p>
                        <p>There are two broad options. One would be a major landing in South China
                            designed to put several divisions ashore with adequate air cover and
                            seize a bridgehead. Into it we would pour more divisions and air
                            support. One bonus effect might be the impact on Communist operations in
                            SEA. But many objections loom. First, <persName>Chiang</persName> simply
                            lacks the resources (except for an unopposed landing in an area already
                            in revolt). Thus he would need substantial US air cover, air and sea
                            lift, and logistic support. I can't see this in the cards for us without
                            some tremendous provocation by the ChiComs, such as their overt
                            intervention in SEA.</p>
                        <p>In any case, if we made a major attempt to retake South China, the
                            Chinese would almost certainly appeal for Soviet aid and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would grant it in good measure. The
                            Soviets would recognize that so long as they confined themselves to
                            defending the ChiCom regime, most of world opinion would be with them;
                            they would not in a period of nuclear stand-off be running unacceptable
                            risk of US retaliation against the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                            itself. So why should they accept the major reverse involved in a
                            successful western counter-attack in China, particularly since they
                            would see an opportunity to re-establish their influence over Peiping.
                            For all these reasons I cannot see us getting involved in even a local
                            war with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> over China.</p>
                        <p>This leaves the option of local probing operations, initially small but
                            if these prove out then on a gradually increasing scale, designed to see
                            whether the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> couldn't gin up a local
                            revolution. Although <persName>Chiang</persName> might ask us to back
                            the first option above, I suspect he would settle for our support or
                            even tacit acquiescence in such probes. The <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> apparently has enough well-trained forces for small
                            scale operations, although they are deficient in lift. There is some
                            appeal in a probing operation designed to find out whether the ChiCom
                            position is as brittle as some think. Moreover, the Soviets might not
                            regard such probes as justifying their counter-intervention, but would
                            prefer to let Peiping stew in its own juice, counting on a Peiping
                            appeal to Moscow if the situation got out of hand.</p>
                        <p>But let's look further at this proposition. Assuming that it were
                            successful and that a revolt of some size could be ginned up, we would
                            then be faced with the circumstances described under first option above.
                            The <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would argue for a major
                            campaign, with substantial US support. So our very success would lead to
                            a situation in which Peiping, humbling itself, would have to turn to the
                            Soviets for aid. Then we'd have a major US/<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> war in China which, even if it did not spread, we'd be
                            unlikely to win. Also, what if the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            failed, even after an initial success? Assuming <pb n="183" xml:id="pg_183" facs="0219"/>that the failure were visible enough,
                            it might mean the end of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>'s
                            pretensions as “the only legitimate government” of China. In fact, the
                            backlash of an unsuccessful attempt would only undermine further the
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>'s international position and
                            make it even more difficult for us to preserve it as an independent
                            government on Taiwan. <persName>Chiang</persName> might be willing to
                            take this gamble, but should we?</p>
                        <p>There is, of course, a third possible outcome between failure and
                            complete success. In effect the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            could stir up enough unrest in South China to deplete further ChiCom
                            resources and energies and to make even more difficult Peiping's
                            economic recovery. However, even this could lead the ChiComs to make
                            their peace with Moscow (at least temporarily—most of us feel that,
                            whatever happens, Sino-Soviet tie will never be the same again).</p>
                        <p>Note that my argument against unleashing <persName>Chiang</persName> is
                            not based on any value judgment as to whether the ChiComs are now weak
                            enough to make the odds favorable—it is based on my contention that, no
                            matter how weak the ChiComs are, the Soviets won't let us succeed.
                            Before discarding the possibility on these grounds, however, let's ask
                            ourselves what happens once Peiping recovers from its current
                            predicament (as is likely, short of some further pressure on it). Since
                            this recovery will probably coincide with ChiCom acquisition of their
                            first home-grown nuclear weapons, it is a gloomy prospect indeed.
                            Therefore, we should at least consider any option which might prolong
                            Peiping's time of troubles so as to allow Japanese and Indian strength
                            to grow and to buy time to strengthen such peripheral areas as SEA,
                            Korea, etc.</p>
                        <p>The above becomes doubly relevant when we might go in the opposite
                            direction and sell food to the ChiComs. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> is looking into bona fides of Seattle firm's

                            go ahead, largely because ChiCom dollars spent for food leave that much
                            less for industrial buildup. But let's think thrice before we start down
                            this road: (a) ChiCom needs are so much greater than piddling 400,000
                            tons that this feeler, if valid, is just to see whether we'll play; (b)
                            Gimo will surely blow his top if we start feeding ChiComs when he wants
                            to push them over; (c) what about effect on new trade bill passage if we
                            start trading with ChiComs at this point?</p>
                        <pb n="184" xml:id="pg_184" facs="0220"/>
                        <p>After considering all these factors, I still come down on the side of
                            keeping the Gimo on a tight leash. Prospects for success in a major
                            spoiling operation directed at Red China are highly problematical,
                            particularly since the Soviets have the counter-option of checkmating us
                            at any time they choose. They might let Peiping stew awhile to teach it
                            a lesson, but if things got bad enough they wouldn't hesitate to step
                            in. If they did so, we would have succeeded in pushing Peiping and
                            Moscow together again, in effect postponing the day when the two giants
                            of the Communist world may be at each other's throats instead of ours.
                            Moreover, bad as things are on the mainland, there is no evidence of any
                            feeling that the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> could make them
                            better (even if we could get across that it would bring with it huge

                        <p>If backing <persName>Chiang</persName> in a last dramatic gamble is
                            against our interests, let's start thinking now about the painful task

                        <p>A memorandum of February 6, 1962, to President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> from <persName corresp="#p_BCA1">Chester Bowles</persName> argued that the Chinese
                            food crisis might offer an opportunity to lessen “the danger of Chinese
                            expansionism” and offered the non-Communist world an opportunity “to
                            gain some important leverage in its economic relations with the Peiping
                            regime.” He suggested beginning with “a highly confidential effort to
                            explore Chinese Communist attitudes.” He was about to leave on a trip to
                            the Middle East and Asia, and he suggested that he stop in Rangoon to
                            discuss the subject with Burmese Prime Minister U Nu. (<persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> Library, President's Office

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BCA1">Bowles</persName> states in a memoir that he
                            met with <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> before his
                            departure and asked him if the United States would be prepared “to sell
                            a limited amount of wheat to the Chinese on an emergency basis for hard
                            currency and without political conditions” and “if China would agree not
                            to attempt to change its existing borders by force (without necessarily
                            forfeiting its claims to territories outside its present borders),”
                            whether it would be prepared “to offer much larger quantities of wheat
                            on a continuing, low interest, long-term basis?”</p>
                        <p>According to <persName corresp="#p_BCA1">Bowles</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> “readily agreed” to the first
                            proposal, suggesting as much as 3 to 5 million tons. Concerning the
                            second proposal, <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> said
                            that “if some reliable means of communication could be opened up,” he
                            would consider an agreement to sell 10 to 12 million tons of American
                            wheat annually on a long-term, easy-credit basis, “provided China agreed
                            to abandon its present military-political pressures on its neighbors.”
                                <persName corresp="#p_BCA1">Bowles</persName> states that <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> agreed that <persName corresp="#p_BCA1">Bowles</persName> could advance these proposals
                            with U Nu, describing them as proposals that he had discussed in general
                            terms with the President but which had not been formally approved.

                            a further, more concrete approach to <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                            and as indicating <persName>Chiang</persName>'s desire for consultations
                            at high level and his hopes for US assent to plan he is suggesting or
                            some feasible modification thereof. <persName>Chiang</persName>'s latest
                            approach also suggests quickening of his resolve to “do something about
                            mainland” in months ahead. I have reviewed <persName>Chiang</persName>'s
                            latest approach together with [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of

                                <persName>Chiang</persName>'s latest suggested plans. It was agreed
                            that best choice of action as of now would be [<hi rend="italic">less

                            consideration by US authorities. Once specific plans were obtained, [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>]
                            US military authorities here would study them for feasibility and pass
                            their views to higher US authorities for consideration. Consensus was
                            that in discussing problem with <persName>Chiang</persName> and his son
                            a sympathetic attitude on our part would be desirable as to keep <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> side engaged and thus permit US side to
                            study proposals and submit observations and counter proposals. There was

                                <persName>Chiang</persName>'s proposals was least desirable course
                            of action and could lead to undesirable actions and consequences. It was
                            also consensus that in discussing problem further <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> side should be pressed to present
                            concrete intelligence to support its estimates of mainland conditions
                            and possibilities of sparking uprising among people. (In this respect it

                                (Department of State, Central Files, 793.00/2-2862)</note> I urged
                            need on both sides for utter frankness, full exchange of views,
                            development of maximum possible intelligence resources re mainland and
                            attitudes of people. I urged need above all for joint agreement
                            respecting use of force against mainland.</p>
                        <p>I said as evidence of our desiring exchange views a <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> estimate of mainland situation<note n="3" xml:id="d88fn3">Not further identified.</note> had been handed
                            his son yesterday. <persName>Chiang</persName> said he had not yet seen
                            our estimate but would read it with interest. I said we would welcome
                            up-to-date <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> estimate, and in this
                            regard stressed need for concrete mainland intelligence.</p>
                        <p>I told <persName>Chiang</persName> Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> would be prepared to discuss mainland problem
                            in general, and urged him to bare his views frankly to <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>.</p>
                        <p><persName>Chiang</persName> expressed view small-scale operations would
                            fail and thus upset his plans, whereas I said <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> skeptical that larger-scale operations could succeed at
                            this juncture. I said there seemed to be a difference of aims. We wanted
                            small-scale operations to test reactions and gather intelligence whereas
                                <persName>Chiang</persName> wanted large-scale operation to touch
                            off explosion. <persName>Chiang</persName> did not dissent from this
                            analysis, but asserted he is confident now is time to act and any delay
                            may allow Communists to retrieve situation. I responded it seemed most
                            important to choose right time and method, adding it my belief mainland
                            deterioration would continue and perhaps open up better opportunities. I
                            also urged <persName>Chiang</persName> to have regard for whole world
                            situation, US responsibilities, et cetera. With so many problems, US
                            naturally cautious about opening new major front. I also said Communist
                            adventures in Southeast Asia or elsewhere might develop in such ways as
                            to open opportunities toward mainland.</p>

                            participant, took place friendly atmosphere, nevertheless, it was
                            utterly clear that <persName>Chiang</persName> is bent on taking some
                            kind of action this year against mainland and that it will take
                            skillful, adept responses on our part to channel his actions in
                            directions we deem appropriate to situation.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CRS1">Cline</persName> replied in a March 7
                            telegram that <persName>Bundy</persName>'s message had been “most
                            helpful.” <persName corresp="#p_CRS1">Cline</persName> had conveyed the

                            without attribution to anyone in Washington and had conveyed
                                <persName>Bundy</persName>'s comments in paragraph 5. <persName corresp="#p_CRS1">Cline</persName> noted that while President

                                <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>'s visit, the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> was “somewhat apprehensive” over what
                            the press was treating as the “strangely abrupt resignation and
                            departure” of <persName corresp="#p_DEF1">Drumright</persName>.
                            (Ibid.)</p>
                        <p>We have received the reports of your conversations and those of my
                            brother with high authorities in Taipei. The President is instructing
                                <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Averell Harriman</persName> to review
                            those matters at the highest possible level during his visit to you
                            March 14-15. Meanwhile, we think it important that an interim response
                            be made along following lines, and you should make this response in such
                            a way as to indicate, without flatly saying so, that it represents the
                            views of the highest authorities here:</p>
                        <p>1. The United States is most appreciative of this full information on the
                            political assessments of the Generalissimo. Such information is
                            obviously the more important and valuable when the matter is one of such
                            significance as a projected mainland effort.</p>
                        <p>2. We continue to base our policy in this matter on the understanding
                            embodied in the exchange of notes of December 10, 1954, between the U.S.
                            Secretary of State and the Chinese Minister of Foreign Affairs. In
                            accordance with the terms of this understanding, the United States
                            remains wholly confident that any “use of force will be a matter of
                            joint agreement.” The responsibilities and interests of both governments
                            make it imperative that this agreement be the basis of all discussion.
                            The interest of the highest authorities here in restating this matter
                            derives simply from an earnest desire for clear understanding that all
                            discussions of our common hopes for the future freedom of the mainland
                            must rest upon this premise.</p>
                        <p>3. The intelligence available to us, and separately reported to you,
                            creates a grave question in our minds as to the timeliness of the
                            particular proposals discussed in the recent conversations. We believe
                            that a first step in further consultation should be a careful joint
                            study of the information available to our two governments.</p>
                        <pb n="192" xml:id="pg_192" facs="0228"/>
                        <p>4. Finally, you should emphasize that <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> is not merely the Assistant Secretary of State
                            with responsibilities for this area. He is also a statesman of long
                            experience and proven friendship for the Government of China. He has the
                            President's full personal confidence, and will be empowered to speak in
                            the most direct and authoritative way for the President himself.</p>
                        <p>5. If you think it appropriate, I should be glad if you would express my
                            personal respects to the appropriate Chinese authorities and say that,
                            at the President's direction, his staff continues to take a most active
                            and sympathetic interest in relations with the Government of China.</p>

                        <p>In your conversations with Generalissimo, I hope you will make it clear
                            that you come with my full authority and that you and I have discussed
                            together the question of ChiNat return to the mainland. You may want to
                            begin by indicating that you and I have repeatedly shown our own support
                            for <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> and therefore count on full
                            understanding by Generalissimo of our position, as follows:</p>
                        <p>1. We continue to assume that all discussions of return to the mainland
                            are governed by the understanding in the exchange of notes between U.S.
                            Secretary of State and Chinese Minister of Foreign Affairs dated
                            December 10, 1954. We know that understanding on this point has been
                            excellent so far, but we should never omit straight-forward repetition
                            of it.</p>
                        <p>2. We believe that most careful study is necessary of both intelligence
                            and operational planning for proposed new venture. You may draw, if you
                            wish, on the Cuban misadventure as proof of the dangers of <pb n="193" xml:id="pg_193" facs="0229"/>bad intelligence, and of decisions
                            based more on hope than reality. You should emphasize our insistence on
                            continued detailed study and exchange of views.</p>
                        <p>3. Our earlier approval of 20-man drops<note n="1" xml:id="d90fn1">An
                                unsigned paper, evidently a draft of a March 30 memorandum from

                                developed by the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>], providing for six
                                20-man teams to be airdropped into South China, was approved in the
                                third week of July 1961 by “a U.S. intragovernmental committee”
                                (presumably the Special Group) and by the President. (Department of
                                State, <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_EA1">EA</gloss> Files: Lot 65 D 235, <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> Mainland Recovery, January 1962) <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName>'s March 30 memorandum omits
                                this point but states that the United States had suggested 20-man
                                probes in mid-1961 in response to <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> plans for 200-300 man airdrops; a few months later,
                                when preparations were complete, the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> declined to carry out the probes on the ground that
                                they would be too small to be useful. (Library of Congress

                            was heavily connected with the fact that we were not involved. 200-man
                            teams with U.S. air support are a wholly different matter, and while we
                            too will await results of further study, you should indicate that
                            support for such drops would be a major shift in policy for us and would
                            have to be supported by compelling evidence.</p>
                        <p>If you concur, you should indicate that it still seems best to us to
                            think in terms of smaller actions which might in themselves increase our
                            knowledge of the possibilities. The smaller the action, and the more
                            completely it is handled by the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>, the
                            more likely our agreement.</p>
                        <p>You should of course make it clear that we would like nothing better than
                            the downfall of the mainland regime, and we are fully aware of the
                            advantages such a change would bring in the whole world situation. But
                            it is one thing to desire a result and quite another to make sound
                            judgment on proposed measures to bring that result about.</p>
                        <p>The more you can learn from the Generalissimo about his precise estimate
                            of the situation, the better, but you should make it clear to him that
                            solid evidence is more interesting to us than eloquently expressed
                            hopes.</p>

                            Minister. The Ambassador seemed to want only to pay a formal call,
                            probably arising from my relations with <persName corresp="#p_YGKC1">George Yeh</persName> last summer. I took the occasion to raise
                            with him the matter of <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> plans to
                            return to the mainland. I told him that we were most appreciative of the
                            Chinese Government's willingness to keep us informed, and I indicated
                            that our own intelligence did not give us much hope that the time was
                            ripe for any such operations. I also reiterated our belief that our
                            discussions and relations on this question should be governed by the
                            exchange of notes of December 1954 between <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_YGKC1">Yeh</persName>.
                            I said that it seemed to me that our interests were so deeply joined
                            together in this issue that we must be sure to agree together before any
                            action is taken. Finally, I indicated that we of course would like
                            nothing better than the end of Communist domination on the mainland, and
                            would always be alert to any real opportunity. But I referred to the
                            Cuban episode, indicating that both our governments must be careful not
                            to mistake hopes for realities.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador indicated that his government would be glad to receive our
                            analysis of the matter, and he said he could add that, on the premises
                            of the basic attitude I have described, he thought we could count on
                            serious attention to our views. He nevertheless asked us to understand
                            how deeply the return to the mainland is the purpose of life of his
                            people.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, I mentioned to him the letter of Pearl Buck on food for
                            the mainland, and asked him what the position of his government would be
                            if there were such a request. He said his government was caught in a
                            dilemma. If it opposed the sale of food, it would be attacked on
                            humanitarian grounds and might also lose popular support on the
                            mainland. But if it approved of them, it might be encouraging the
                            political and military reinforcement of the mainland regime. In this
                            situation his government had so far refrained from expressing an opinion
                            on Australian and Canadian sales. He obviously was much interested in
                            what we might or might not do, but I confined my own remarks to saying
                            that this question had not yet arisen. The Ambassador did indicate that
                            he believed the conditions laid down by Mrs. Buck would prove
                            unacceptable to Peking.</p>

                            at length his strategy for return to mainland. After exchange of rather
                            warm reminiscences about Cairo, President Roosevelt, Chung-king, etc.,
                            in which I underlined President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>'s friendly attitude, he led off by saying mutual
                            defense pact called for consultation on action to be taken, and
                            expressed confidence President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> was sympathetic with his objectives and would do
                            nothing to deter or prevent him from acting. He asked me to assure
                            President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> he would not do
                            anything behind back of US Government nor anything detrimental or
                            harmful to US. I reminded him twice need not only for consultation, but
                            also agreement. He responded the second time that he hoped our
                            conversation would deal with political problem of how to achieve our
                            common objectives, rather than discuss legal position.</p>
                        <p><persName>Chiang</persName> said he had heard US intelligence sources
                            had reported <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> about to take action in
                            month's time. He said, laughing, not to worry that he had no such
                            intent.</p>
                        <p>I replied that I had heard rumor to that effect, but did not take
                            seriously since I knew he was aware his forces could not be prepared for
                            such rapid action.</p>
                        <p><persName>Chiang</persName> said help must be given first to people on
                            mainland so they could rise against Communist regime only then would
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> move in to support them. He now
                            concerned with first stage, for which he needed transport from US to
                            carry out drops over mainland. He said he did not wish to go into
                            technical details, which could be studied by US and <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> military [<hi rend="italic">less than 1

                            want to risk turn down of request for planes through me direct to
                            President.</p>
                        <p>He then presented strong plea for US understanding and cooperation.
                            People on mainland ripe for revolt. Although outer fabric of ChiCom
                            regime might look solid, once pierced there would be massive uprisings
                            and defections. He did not desire intervention by US troops.</p>
                        <pb n="196" xml:id="pg_196" facs="0232"/>
                        <p><persName>Chiang</persName> repeated several times that he would not act
                            lightly, but only on definite assurance of success. If he had no such
                            assurance he would not act. Present opportunity was heaven-sent and must
                            be taken or it would be lost forever. Things could not get much worse on
                            mainland and by next autumn would have reached decisive stage. When
                            eruption occurred <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would have to
                            act.</p>
                        <p>I told <persName>Chiang</persName> I knew President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> would be glad to learn of the
                            caution with which he approaching matter. One mistake could be
                            disastrous.</p>
                        <p><persName>Chiang</persName> said he realized a reverse would have
                            serious consequences, said he had high sense responsibility and
                            situation called for greater caution. He was not impatient, but people
                            and armed forces were and unless action taken soon he might lose control
                            and things might begin to happen not according to plan. This would be
                            matter of great regret.</p>
                        <p>I told him I had no fear his control. I congratulated him on Taiwan's
                            progress and urged expansion of Taiwan's technical assistance program to
                            other Asian and African countries. <persName>Chiang</persName> said he
                            would be glad to do so.</p>
                        <p>We had some discussion regarding Moscow-Peiping rift.
                                <persName>Chiang</persName> expressed view it was largely personal
                            clash between <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. I explained in my opinion
                            differences dated back to Stalin's time and were fundamental.
                                <persName>Chiang</persName> felt Soviets would not intervene in
                            China. I stated firmly that I was sure Soviets would if US forces
                            involved. At that point he agreed and said that was why he planned on
                            use only of Chinese forces.</p>
                        <p><persName>Chiang</persName> asked for frequent consultation on mainland
                            problem. I said President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>
                            wished to keep in closest touch and exchanges of views could be held as
                            often as <persName>Chiang</persName> thought necessary.</p>
                        <p>I said that I found it odd for an American to be advising a Chinese to be
                            patient. He seemed to take this in good part.<note n="3" xml:id="d92fn3">
                                <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> sent an additional
                                message to the President in telegram 1471 from Bangkok, which
                                commented that <persName>Chiang</persName> “obviously wanted me to
                                accept his concept that return to mainland was Chinese affair and
                                his only obligation was consultation, not prior agreement, with us.
                                When he failed in that, he undertook to impress me with the care and
                                caution with which he was approaching the undertaking. He avoided
                                making any specific request for aircraft, I felt, because he did not
                                want to get a turn-down direct from the President. He called Admiral
                                    <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName> back to see him the
                                next morning and repeated the request already mentioned by his son
                                to [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not

                                granted, he will consider that the operation he has in mind will be
                                approved although he has no direct evidence that it will succeed.
                                The most optimistic estimate I have heard from any American is ten
                                to one against achievement its objective.” (Ibid.,

                        </list>
                        <p>You will recall that Thomas W.I. Liao, self-styled “President of the
                            Republic of Formosa in Exile,” was denied a United States visa prior to
                            1961 because it was believed that his anticipated activities in the
                            United States would be prejudicial to the national interest under
                            Section 212(a)(27) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. It is clear
                            that Liao's main purpose in seeking admission to the United States is to
                            press his cause on Americans and to build up support for it among
                            Taiwanese groups here. The Government of the Republic of China (<gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>) is well aware of Liao's activities and
                            plans and would take strong exception to his entry into the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>For several years the Department has been under continuing pressure from
                            Senator <persName corresp="#p_FJW1">Fulbright</persName> to admit Liao
                            on the grounds that his continued exclusion is incompatible with our
                            traditional attitude regarding the right of dissenters to be heard in
                            the United States. In May 1961 the Department concluded that Liao should
                            no longer be excluded on the grounds cited above, and decided to admit
                            him. In response to a subsequent <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            protest the Department replied that we would defer issuing a visa until
                            we had discussed with the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> the best
                            way of handling his admission.</p>
                        <p>You ordered this deferral to minimize difficulties we then faced with the
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>, particularly in connection with
                            the Chinese representation issue in the United Nations. At no time was
                            the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> given reason to believe that
                            Liao would be barred permanently. During your discussions with Vice
                            President Chen Cheng on August 1, 1961, the point was made to him that
                            Liao's presence in the United States would go virtually unnoticed, but
                            that his continued exclusion might make him a figure of national
                            prominence. Recent publicity in the <hi rend="italic">New York
                                Times</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Look</hi> magazine have borne out
                            this contention.</p>
                        <p>Liao's entry would under any circumstances cause at least a temporary
                            worsening in our relations with the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>,
                            and in particular would anger President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName>. We believe, however, that the anticipated
                            adverse <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> reaction could be reduced if
                            Liao's admission were to come when our relations with the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> are otherwise reasonably tranquil. <pb n="198" xml:id="pg_198" facs="0234"/>Since the Chinese
                            representation issue is not active in the United Nations, it appears
                            that the next few weeks may afford us an opportunity to admit Liao with
                            a minimum adverse impact. The Department has accordingly decided to
                            admit Liao to the United States under the conditions set forth below,
                            subject to your approval.</p>
                        <p>In order to lessen the effect on <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            sensitivities of Liao's activities in the United States, the Department
                            proposes to require that he comply with the provisions of the Foreign

                            “government's” headquarters here, we would inform him that the United
                            States Government does not tolerate the existence of such regimes in
                            this country, and that he must either desist or face deportation. With
                            such leverage over Liao, the Department believes we could safely admit
                            him at an early date and so control his activities as to minimize the
                            impact on our relations with the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>We would, of course, want Liao out of the country prior to the opening of
                            the next General Assembly, when his presence might be damaging to our
                            effort to sustain the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>'s position in
                            the United Nations, and possibly seriously affect our relations with the
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>. The Department would therefore
                            propose to request the Immigration and Naturalization Service to limit
                            Liao's stay to a three month period. We would also inform the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> of our decision, and of the actions we
                            would take to minimize the effect of his activities here.<note n="1" xml:id="d93fn1">A memorandum of March 27 from

                        <p>As you may know, the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> Station Chief in
                            Taipei, <persName corresp="#p_CRS1">Ray Cline</persName>, was called
                            back to Washington for consultation shortly after your visit to Taipei.
                            At my request, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CRS1">Cline</persName> called
                            on me March 27 to brief me on his recent discussions with Generalissimo
                                <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> concerning
                                <persName>Chiang</persName>'s plans for mainland operations, and to
                            give me his own impressions of the alternatives for United States policy
                            which these plans entail. In essence, <persName corresp="#p_CRS1">Cline</persName> expressed the view that the situation leaves us
                            with but two courses of action, as follows:</p>
                        <p>1) To give <persName>Chiang</persName> a flat “no” in his request for
                            United States support of several clandestine operations against the
                            China mainland involving airdrops of 200 to 300-man teams. According to
                                <persName corresp="#p_CRS1">Cline</persName>, this alternative would
                            unquestionably evoke a bitter reaction from <persName>Chiang</persName>
                            which might lead to anti-American demonstrations, disruption of American
                                [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>] and other programs on Taiwan, and, conceivably,
                            “desperation” attacks by the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> against
                            the mainland in hopes of involving the United States. <persName corresp="#p_CRS1">Cline</persName> also reported that in such
                            circumstances the Generalissimo might ultimately resign as President of
                            the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>, thus causing political chaos on
                            Taiwan and in US-<gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> relations.</p>
                        <p>2) To temporize by agreeing to furnish suitable aircraft and other
                            support for one <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> operation of
                            approximately 50-100 men against the mainland. <persName corresp="#p_CRS1">Cline</persName> anticipated that it might require
                            from six to twelve months before the operation could actually take
                            place, thanks to the delay needed to add proper electronic
                            counter-measure equipment to the aircraft (either C-130's or C-123's)
                            and to complete adequate planning and training for the operation. During
                            this time we would, of course, be in constant touch with the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> on the feasibility of the project. We
                            would also be able [<hi rend="italic">1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>] and, if deemed necessary, to make plans for
                            dealing with successors to <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang
                                Kai-shek</persName> if we subsequently were to decide that we should
                            discontinue our support of his plans and the consequences noted in 1,
                            above, should develop. On the other hand, if we should wish to avoid a
                            showdown with <persName>Chiang</persName> at the end of the period of
                            grace, we could possibly find ways to bring about further delays in
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> moves against the mainland.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CRS1">Cline</persName> indicated that he greatly
                            wishes to discuss these considerations in person with you prior to his
                            return to Taipei, both to have the opportunity for a fuller exploration
                            of the implications and to be able to assure <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> that the detailed information he brought
                            about their plans and views have been passed to high officials of the
                            United States Government, including yourself. His departure for Taipei
                            is presently set for the evening of March 29, but he is prepared to put
                            off his return until the evening of March 31 if he could meet you
                            briefly in the interval. I strongly recommend that you see him at your

                        <p>Conclusions</p>
                        <p>1. Public dissatisfaction and demoralization are widespread in Communist
                            China and there has been some weakening of discipline among local
                            officials and low-level party cadres. Nevertheless the regime's control
                            apparatus is still intact and effective. Present indications are that
                            the regime will continue to be able to isolate and repress any likely
                            internal challenge to its authority. (Paras. 5-7)</p>
                        <p>2. Even if <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> special forces teams could
                            be successfully established on the mainland, they would almost certainly
                            be destroyed in a short time. Very few people, and no significant
                            military units, would be likely to join the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> forces in the absence of clear military success—which
                            we believe would be impossible without large-scale US support. (Para.
                            17)</p>
                        <p>3. US refusal to support or sanction the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> proposals for special forces operations would place
                            additional strains on US-<gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> relations.
                            We believe that the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> leaders, despite
                            their limited capabilities, might undertake some kind of special force
                            operations against the mainland in 1962 even without US approval. (Para.
                            9)</p>
                        <p>4. If the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> were or undertake military
                            operations on the mainland, with or without US support, Communist China
                            and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would launch major
                            propaganda and political campaigns against the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> and the US. Peiping might undertake some retaliatory
                            action in the Taiwan Strait area. Moscow would be most unlikely to alter
                            its policies toward Communist China or the US so long as the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> operations met with no notable success.
                            In the unlikely event that Communist control of the mainland were
                            threatened, the Soviet leaders would almost certainly support the regime
                            to the extent necessary to put down the rebellion, while exploiting the
                            opportunity to attempt to bring Peiping's policy and outlook in line
                            with that of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. (Paras.

                                Yang. It reads in part as follows: “Both these officials spoke quite
                                frankly of the economic consequences of plans underway for some kind
                                of operations against the mainland. Minister Yang also indicated
                                that loss of confidence by mainlanders in U.S. policy toward China,

                                expense of Taiwan's economy. Feeling that U.S. economic aid and

                        <p>There is no clear indication as to timing of possible action against
                            mainland. Current evidence of <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            thinking points to early fall as most likely target date, but we doubt
                                <persName>Chiang</persName> has reached any decision. US attitude
                            likely have important influence on decision. On one hand we should avoid
                            encouraging <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> in preparations for
                            early overt military action against mainland. On other hand, we should
                            avoid such flat opposition to <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            proposals and objectives which create serious risk of unilateral
                            desperate lunge to take advantage of conjunction of circumstances which
                                <persName>Chiang</persName> almost certainly regards as unique and
                            most unlikely to recur. This likely prove extraordinarily difficult
                            balancing act, for we believe <persName>Chiang</persName> to be deadly
                            serious in his determination to take action and he can be expected to
                            try to edge us steadily in direction of agreeing to larger operations,
                            threatening unilateral action if we do not go along. Nevertheless, he is
                            not reckless man and recognizes only too clearly how dependent he is on
                            US support. So long as he is satisfied US <pb n="203" xml:id="pg_203" facs="0239"/>Government is fundamentally in sympathy with his
                            objectives, has no intention of changing its China policy and shows
                            willingness to at least study plans for action against mainland, I think
                            it unlikely, for the next few months at least, that he would resort to
                            unilateral assault. Of course, substantial uprising on mainland would
                            change situation entirely and create enormous pressure on him to act
                            immediately.</p>
                        <p>Believe following courses of action would be appropriate US response to
                            present situation:</p>
                        <p>1. Take steps to discourage excessive press publicity on mainland attack
                            theme. <persName corresp="#p_YJA1">Yager</persName> has already spoken
                            to Vice Premier, <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> to <persName corresp="#p_CC2">Chiang Ching-kuo</persName> and political counselor
                            Deputy Secretary General of Kuomintang on this. Recommend I be
                            instructed take up with Foreign Minister, pointing out dangers of
                            building up premature expectations in Taiwan, of tipping hand to
                            ChiComs, and unnecessarily alarming other countries to detriment of
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> international position.</p>
                        <p>2. Have <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> examine in detail and discuss
                            with <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> proposal for 200-300 man drops
                            or alternative smaller clandestine operations against mainland.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CRS1">Cline</persName> will have discussed
                            this thoroughly on current visit to Washington.</p>
                        <p>3. Request opportunity for US military to make detailed examination
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> planning going beyond
                            clandestine operations. <persName>Chiang</persName>'s offer in
                            conversation with you to make details his planning available could be
                            used as basis for request. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SVARN1">Smoot</persName> much concerned at extensive <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> planning and preparations now going on
                            which his officers have no access, but which might have profound effect
                            on combined planning for defense of Taiwan and Penghus for which he
                            bears responsibility. We believe US scrutiny <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> offensive planning would inject greater realism into
                            thinking on this subject and ultimately would affect
                                <persName>Chiang</persName>'s own thinking. Admittedly, US-<gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> study and discussion of <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> offensive planning might be taken to
                            imply degree of US commitment to offensive concept. There would have to
                            be clear and unmistakable disclaimers of any such US commitment. If time
                            should come, as it well may, when we have to express flat opposition to
                            a proposed <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> offensive action, we
                            would be in far better position to do so on basis of unrealistic nature
                            their plans, which we had studied in detail, rather than solely on basis
                            of our differing judgments of likely mainland response.</p>
                        <p>4. Make demarche on economic situation, aimed in first instance at
                            seeking more information on military spending, but expressing concern at
                            threat to stability of economy if it continues. We will send separate
                            cable shortly containing more detailed recommendation.</p>
                        <p>5. Consider urgently in Washington proposing to <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> a program of substantially increased [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] probing
                            activity against mainland to produce better intelligence on state of
                            Chinese Communist controls and to increase chances for perfection.
                            Program <pb n="204" xml:id="pg_204" facs="0240"/>should cover as broad
                            of a spectrum as possible, [<hi rend="italic">5 lines of source text not
                                declassified</hi>].</p>
                        <p>Believe foregoing series of actions, while it would exert only limited
                            initial restraining influence on <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            preparations for mainland attack, would serve at least to postpone any
                            decision for unilateral action and would place us in better position to
                            oppose such action later.</p>

                            nonsense, and the idea that we could keep it covert was also nonsense.
                            The <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> hand would show and so would the

                            Chinese Nationalists could get back into the Mainland. They couldn't.
                            The issue was whether we reject the plan outright or whether we
                            temporize. My fear was that if there were an outright rejection, the
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would immediately start a public
                            campaign to arouse the China lobby. There was also a great danger in
                            temporizing, i.e., that we get ourselves more and more committed to the
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> in the familiar pattern of the
                            covert operations in Indonesia and Cuba.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>, by the way, beforehand
                            was very worried that the Secretary would recommend outright rejection.

                            temporizing.</p>
                        <p>The President proposed preparing two C-123's in the United States.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CRS1">Ray Cline</persName> said that he had to
                            take back something tangible. The President then suggested that we also
                            train Chinese crews here in the United States in the operation of these
                            planes.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CRS1">Cline</persName> said that this would be
                            satisfactory.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary agreed providing that the planes were prepared in this
                            country and not sent to Taiwan before a further decision was made.</p>
                        <p>The President said that <persName corresp="#p_CRS1">Cline</persName>
                            should make it clear to the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> that no
                            commitment was being made other than to prepare the planes and be
                            willing to consider their use in the light of the intelligence available
                            in October. The President also instructed Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CRS1">Cline</persName> to get a commitment from the
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> that there would be no further
                            public discussion of a return to the Mainland.</p>
                        <p>I suggested that another commitment be obtained to permit American
                            participation in the other planning that the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> was doing.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName> made the point
                            very strongly that <persName corresp="#p_CRS1">Ray Cline</persName> was

                            on the Mainland of China in which freedom might be restored to the
                            Chinese people.</p>

                            on detailed planning for the future.</p>
                        <p>4. In order to achieve the above objectives, the United States favors
                            probing operations and specifically the joint training, equipping, and
                            supervising of the formation of probing teams of the type previously

                                understanding and stated that his impression was that subsequent
                                operations might be studied in accordance with paragraph 3, but that
                                their detailed planning and preparation for execution would require
                                further authorization. (Both ibid.)</note> The United States will,
                            concurrently with such planning, prepare two C-123 aircraft in the

                            preparation and training will take about six months and the planes will
                            be made available to the GOC when and if there is agreement between us
                            that an operation is feasible and timely. It must be understood that we
                            are preparing the capability for this operation—but have made no
                            decision at this time to proceed with it.<note n="6" xml:id="d98fn6">On

                        <p>At the January 26, 1962, meeting of the National Security Council
                            Standing Group it was agreed that the Department of State should submit
                                <pb n="209" xml:id="pg_209" facs="0245"/>to you recommendations
                            regarding possible sale of food grains to Communist China.<note n="1" xml:id="d100fn1">See <ref target="#d84fn4">footnote 4, Document
                                    84</ref>. The application that prompted the Standing Group
                                discussion was rejected on March 23. A March 26 memorandum from
                                    <persName corresp="#p_REE1">Rice</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> quotes the text of a
                                Department of Commerce announcement that day stating there was no
                                evidence that the order was based on a request from the governments
                                concerned. <persName corresp="#p_REE1">Rice</persName>'s memorandum

                        </p>
                        <p>In formulating such recommendations we have sought to take into account
                            the background facts of China's international crises and its dispute
                            with the U.S.S.R.; the Cuba precedent in the context of exports of both
                            food and medicines; humanitarian concern of Americans for the plight of
                            suffering people, whatever the character of the regime under which they
                            live; the clearly demonstrated determination of the Chinese Communist
                            leadership not to accept American charity; restrictions imposed by U.S.
                            legislation; the desirability of having Communist China's foreign
                            exchange used for food purchases rather than industrial development;
                            availability of non-U.S. sources of supply; the undesirability of our
                            seeming to be motivated unduly by commercial considerations; Communist
                            China's international behavior; the known unwillingness of China's
                            present principal suppliers to attach political conditions to sales of
                            foodstuffs to Communist China, together with the near certainty that
                            Communist China would reject efforts explicitly to establish such a
                            connection; the probable domestic and foreign repercussions of now
                            changing present policy; the needs to retain flexibility and to bring
                            about a more fruitful dialogue between Communist China and the U.S.; the
                            long-term possibility of a different relationship between the U.S. and
                            Communist China; and the related undesirability of establishing a record
                            of unwillingness to supply food to the Chinese people when they badly
                            need it and if it cannot be obtained elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>Against this background we have formulated four recommendations. In
                            considering them we would point out that adopting the second
                            recommendation may serve useful purposes vis-a-vis the American people
                            and world opinion, but would probably be regarded by the leaders of
                            Communist China as principally designed to call attention to their and
                            their country's failures of policy and performance. Especially if it
                            were accompanied by propaganda fanfare, it would inhibit the dialogue
                            intended to be promoted by the third recommendation.</p>
                        <p>The following are our recommendations:</p>
                        <p>1. The Department of Commerce should forthwith place shipments of
                            medicines to all destinations under general license (on the <pb n="210" xml:id="pg_210" facs="0246"/>grounds that the U.S. Government should
                            not place obstacles between such medicines and the human beings who may
                            need them).</p>
                        <p>2. The U.S. Government should make known, but without accompanying
                            propaganda exploitation, that it has not been our policy to deny
                            licenses for the export of food parcels to Communist China, and that the
                            Department of Commerce henceforth also will license bona fide private
                            gift shipments of food, or food grains, to that country.</p>
                        <p>3. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CJM1">Cabot</persName>, in his talks
                            with <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang Ping-nan</persName> in Warsaw,
                            should state:</p>
                        <p>a. The U.S. Government has been told that the Chinese Communist regime is
                            interested in the purchase of U.S. grains. We have reason to doubt
                            whether such interest does exist. However, if there is such interest, we
                            are curious to know why, since the Chinese Communist regime has not
                            exhausted possibilities of meeting its needs from other free world
                            suppliers;</p>
                        <p>b. United States legislation now precludes our Government's selling grain
                            to Communist China on credit terms as favorable as those offered by
                            other suppliers;</p>
                        <p>c. If the Chinese Communists were able to finance United States grain
                            purchases, given the foregoing legal restrictions, they should also be
                            able to finance the equivalent purchases from other suppliers;</p>
                        <p>d. The U.S. Government is not now interested in modifying the relevant
                            policies from commercial or financial motives, and could not justify
                            revision of trade control policies for humanitarian motives so long as
                            Chinese needs can be met by other principal suppliers;</p>
                        <p>e. It could reconsider the matter at such times as it may become evident
                            that mainland China's needs cannot be met elsewhere; and</p>
                        <p>f. The U.S. Government would not propose to make propaganda capital out
                            of the fact of an approach to us for food grains.</p>
                        <p>4. The Department of State should inform the Governments of Australia,
                            Canada and France that the U.S. Government has considered but has not
                            adopted proposals which would have put the United States in competition
                            with those countries as suppliers of grain to mainland China; that we do
                            not expect or ask them in present circumstances to attach extraneous
                            conditions to their supply of food grains to Communist China; that it
                            might, however, be possible to deter deeper Chinese Communist external
                            involvement at the expense of the free world if the Peiping regime were
                            to recognize that there would be a relationship between the direction of
                            any important change in its external behavior and continued availability
                            to it of non-bloc food grains, and that we <pb n="211" xml:id="pg_211" facs="0247"/>would hope those Governments would at an appropriate
                            time find suitable means of conveying this fact to the Chinese
                                Communists.<note n="2" xml:id="d100fn2">In a meeting with the
                                Canadian and Australian Ambassadors on January 16, <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> conveyed U.S. interest in “any
                                potential lever which might be useful as a possible restraint on any
                                aggressive intentions of Communist China.” He emphasized that he was
                                not suggesting that Canadian and Australian wheat sales should be
                                stopped and that “it might even develop that increased sales would
                                be found useful.” (Ibid., Central Files, 493.009/1-1662)</note>

                        <p>1. In opening <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> attacked US
                            Far East policies as predicted, with emphasis on alleged US occupation
                            Taiwan as basic to our strained relations. After rebutting as
                            instructed, I spoke of the problem of dogma at bottom of much of our
                            misunderstandings, along lines paragraphs 2 and 3 reference

                                the United States as an enemy because of dogma rather than facts.
                                Paragraph 3 declared that it would be in the interests of both sides
                                if they were to take an objective look at the situation.</note>

                            <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> did not respond to this
                            point.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> said no one doubts
                            American people want peace but world cannot believe US Government
                            following policy of peace. It did <pb n="212" xml:id="pg_212" facs="0248"/>during Roosevelt era but not since. Said US had
                            organized military blocs taking China, Soviet Union and all socialist
                            countries as targets; had hundreds of military bases around world; sent
                            troops into Lebanon, Cuba, Laos and South Vietnam; and now, against
                            world opinion promises resume nuclear tests. I rebutted these points.
                                <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> further claimed Chinese
                            Communist policy not simply determined by theory and dogma, but
                            primarily on basis actual relations between countries and on facts.
                            Spoke with feeling of century of humiliation China had suffered and said
                            Chinese people capable of judging from history which nations treated
                            China equally and which otherwise. China will no longer be subjected to
                            insults from foreigners or intimidated by foreign power. No one would
                            prevent China from exercising its legitimate rights under name of
                            so-called defensive measures.</p>
                        <p>3. I said not only Roosevelt but succeeding Presidents had all been
                            freely elected by American people and all have striven to represent
                            peace-loving policies of American people. After World War II US largely
                            disarmed but unfortunately [garble] many others had not. Outlined
                            Communist hostility which forced us to join with other free nations in
                            defense. Spoke of our constant efforts in interest disarmament.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> returned again to
                            difference between desires American people and policy of government. I
                            said representatives of people in Congress had repeatedly and in
                            overwhelming majority showed intention of American people resist
                            aggression by Chinese Communists, stressed importance studying sequence
                            of events in Far East which show US defensive moves always in response
                            Communist provocation.</p>
                        <p>5. In speaking of seven serious warnings of sea and air intrusions since
                            last meeting, <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> complained
                            specifically of US ships in territorial waters Yung Hsing Island which
                            did not withdraw after warning flashed. I said I would be glad to
                            inquire as to the circumstances of this alleged invasion. Request
                            guidance in answering for next meeting.</p>
                        <p>Nothing new introduced in long, futile meeting.</p>

                            of April 3<note n="1" xml:id="d102fn1">See the source note, <ref target="#d100">Document 100</ref>.</note> to you on the
                            foregoing subject notes, I am not able to concur in the third
                            recommendation in the draft Memorandum for the President, that is, the
                            proposal that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CJM1">Cabot</persName>,
                            in his talks with <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang Ping-nan</persName>
                            in Warsaw should take the initiative in indicating a willingness to
                            reconsider our policy on the sale of grain to Communist China at such
                            time as it may become evident that Mainland China's needs cannot be met
                            elsewhere. Among my reasons are the following:</p>
                        <p>1. Basically, I feel that our posture toward Communist China should be
                            one of receptivity toward any initiatives they may take for improvement
                            of relations with us, but, at least for the time being, not to make
                            further overtures of our own. Our previous and most recent overtures
                            have been most rudely rejected.</p>
                        <p>2. Chinese Communist hostility toward us is based on our policy with
                            respect to Taiwan. All other issues, including trade, are very
                            peripheral. There is little hope of any useful dialogue between
                            ourselves and the Chinese Communists until there is some change in their
                            attitudes in this regard. There is as yet no sign of any such
                            change.</p>
                        <p>3. The Chinese Communists have consistently taken the position that they
                            could afford to wait and that, without their making any concessions, the
                            pressure of events would require unilateral adjustments of U.S. policy,
                            viz. outside pressures with respect to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and Taiwan, and our own commercial pressures with
                            respect to trade. Now to make such an even tentative approach to them
                            with respect to grain will tend to convince them that their policy is
                            paying off and that we are being forced to react to the pressures of our
                            commercial grain interests. All they have to do is to continue to wait
                            and we will continue to move in their direction.</p>
                        <pb n="214" xml:id="pg_214" facs="0250"/>
                        <p>4. Our expressed willingness to permit gift shipments of food, as
                            suggested in the second recommendation, and which will in all
                            probability again be blocked by Chinese Communist unwillingness to
                            permit such shipments, will do all that is necessary at this time to
                            remove any onus on the United States for hunger in China and place the
                            onus where it properly belongs, on the Chinese Communist Government.</p>
                        <p>5. I am satisfied that, if and when the Chinese Communists have a genuine
                            interest in the purchase of American grain, we will unmistakably know
                            it—not directly, for they will never mention it in Warsaw, but rather
                            indirectly.</p>

                            press had played up counterattack too sensationally. He assured me
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> had not instigated press to do
                            this, <pb n="215" xml:id="pg_215" facs="0251"/>as was demonstrated by
                            fact that Government papers treated subject in a much more sober and
                            calm manner than independent press. He had personally made effort to
                            restrain press. At secret meeting for Foreign Affairs Committee of
                            Legislative Yuan he had tried to dampen speculation about political
                            significance of <persName corresp="#p_DEF1">Drumright</persName>'s
                            resignation, publication of 1943 papers,<note n="4" xml:id="d103fn4">Reference is to <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations,</hi> 1943,

                                March 8, suggested that in case <persName>Chiang</persName> raised

                                out that the volume had been printed for release in 1957 and had
                                been withheld from publication since that time, but pressure for its
                                release had been intensifying, and the Department considered that
                                further withholding would be more damaging to U.S. and <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> interests than its release.

                                    <persName>Chiang</persName> did not raise the subject with

                            also held background briefing March 27 for publishers and editors of
                            newspapers at which he not only argued vigorously that there was no
                            basis for speculation regarding possible change in US policy, but also
                            urged pressmen not to agitate unduly counterattack question,
                            particularly US relationship to it. He pointed out to publishers that no
                            possible good could come from causing questions to be put to US
                            spokesmen regarding US attitude toward counterattack, for those
                            spokesmen could not possibly under present circumstances respond in any
                            way helpful to <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> objectives. <persName corresp="#p_SC1">Shen</persName> expressed appreciation at my having
                            raised subject with him and added he thought our two governments had
                            common interest in avoiding excessive press attention to counterattack
                            theme. He said of course subject could not be totally ignored by press
                            in Taiwan, but it should not be sensationalized.</p>

                            to dangers and will do what it can to influence press as well as other

                            expect from local newsmen on arrival and believe this has helped to keep

                        <p>I would like to respond to the arguments contained in Mr.
                                <persName>Johnson</persName>'s memo to you of April 6,<note n="1" xml:id="d104fn1">

                                <persName>Johnson</persName> objected to the proposal, advanced in
                            the memo on the foregoing subject which I sent you through Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MGGC1">McGhee</persName> on April 3,<note n="2" xml:id="d104fn2">See the source note, <ref target="#d100">Document
                                    100</ref>.</note> that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CJM1">Cabot</persName> let the Chinese Communists know we could
                            reconsider our present policy against selling food grains to mainland
                            China if and when it became evident that its needs could not be met by
                            purchases elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>Whether such reconsideration resulted in a decision to sell, or not to do
                            so, would of course have to depend on the whole set of surrounding
                            circumstances. I think we should not indicate actual willingness to sell
                            foodstuffs to Communist China unless the Peiping regime takes the
                            initiative—lest we seem to be anxious for commercial profits. I also
                            believe that we should not exploit any such initiative by them for
                            purposes of political propaganda. This accords very closely with what
                            the President said in his January 25, 1961, news conference<note n="3" xml:id="d104fn3">See <ref target="#d10fn3">footnote 3, Document
                                    10</ref>.</note> in the context, however, of sending food
                            through the United Nations, CARE, or a similar organization. He alluded
                            to some circumstances which militated against our supplying food to
                            Communist China, but he also expressed concern for hunger anywhere, a
                            willingness to give careful consideration to any indication of a desire
                            for food from the United States and disinterest in offering it as a mere
                            propaganda gesture.</p>
                        <p>Since then, the Chinese Communists have come considerably closer to
                            exhausting other sources of grain. Nevertheless, a statement of the sort
                            proposed, in the Warsaw talks, might well be brushed aside, perhaps
                            rudely. The Chinese Communist leadership has made a part of its stock in
                            trade the portrayal of the US as an enemy of the Chinese people. I am
                            against giving them ammunition by our acts or failures to act: We should
                            not live up to their picture of us. Moreover, we do not know what inner
                            battles may be going on now and may occur in the future within the
                            Chinese <pb n="217" xml:id="pg_217" facs="0253"/>Communist leadership:
                            Internal and external difficulties must surely be breeding differences
                            within that leadership. Evidence that the US would be willing to play a
                            part in moving our relationship away from one of implacable mutual
                            hostility might strengthen the hand of any elements which might favor
                            doing so, now or later. Whether it did or not, I think we should not
                            have our historical record be one of having refused to sell food to a
                            people in a period when food was greatly needed. That would be a record
                            which might one day rise to haunt us.</p>
                        <p>Against this perspective, I am not impressed by the argument that we
                            should, “at least for the time being, not make any overtures of our
                            own”. If we are ever to make them, we can do so more gracefully now
                            than, say, after the Chinese Communists have exploded a nuclear
                            device—when overtures might be interpreted as motivated by
                            apprehension.</p>
                        <p>The move we suggest is a small one, but our choice seems to be between
                            immobility and steps which are few and small. I cannot believe that a
                            policy of immobility can serve us well in a world where change is the
                                rule.<note n="4" xml:id="d104fn4">The grain sales issue was

                            is well understood here and your efforts to convey our position to the
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> are greatly appreciated.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> position must be that it stands
                            on what is outlined in the President's seven-point statement. We cannot
                            safely get ourselves in the position of negotiating on this.</p>
                        <p>In the light of the above our comments on the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> ABC formulation are as follows:</p>
                        <p>Point A goes further than the seven-point statement in that it commits
                            the United States to a drop of a 200 man unit with only the date subject
                            to discussion and joint agreement. The statement only contemplated
                            studying the feasibility of such a drop, preparing two aircraft for
                            possible <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> use and making them
                            available only if hard evidence is obtained to support the conclusion
                            that such an operation would succeed.</p>
                        <p>In connection with the lack of hard evidence no mention is made of point
                            four of the seven-point statement.</p>
                        <p>The statements in Points B and C that the United States Government and
                            the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> will “study” subsequent
                            clandestine and open military actions and “jointly decide” their
                            “execution and timing” could be interpreted to commit the United States
                            to approve such actions in advance and by implication to support them.
                            The seven-point statement made no mention of subsequent actions.</p>
                        <p>We recognize your problem is conveying this position effectively and we
                            suggest that you hang your report on the difficulty which we have in the
                            United States Government in asking the President in matters of this kind
                            to approve two different formulations of policy. After all, in <pb n="219" xml:id="pg_219" facs="0255"/>logic, if in fact the
                            three-point formulation is the same as the seven-point formulation, it
                            is not necessary, and if there is a difference, there would be danger of
                            misunderstanding not only with our good friends in Taiwan but within the

                            should make following points to Vice President:</p>
                        <pb n="220" xml:id="pg_220" facs="0256"/>
                        <p>(1) United States Government deeply concerned over threat to economic
                            stability of Taiwan posed by alarming increase in military expenditures
                            now taking place and proposed. Such spending cannot in our view be
                            justified on ground of military necessity. While we appreciate <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> desire to be prepared for eventual
                            return to mainland, our best intelligence convinces us that Chinese
                            Communist security controls have not yet deteriorated to point where
                            attacks at present time or in immediate future could have any hope of
                            success. Current and projected military spending could in fact seriously
                            damage <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> base on Taiwan and impair
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> efforts achieve ultimate goal.
                            (Might recall Chen's theme that efforts Taiwan's economic development
                            justified by importance as base for mainland recovery.) Emphasize loss
                            of confidence in currency that can result from inflation threat,
                            possible undoing of fiscal and exchange reforms of last several years,
                            impact of diversion of resources from development purposes, undermining
                            of program induce foreign investment, and adverse effect Four Year Plan
                            and Accelerated Development Program. (We believe Vice President much
                            concerned all these points.) He undoubtedly mindful that all Chinese
                            bear scars disastrous war and post-war inflation on mainland, and that
                            resumption sharp inflation could have grave repercussions public
                            confidence in government.</p>
                        <p>(2) United States Government deeply disappointed over failure of <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> to keep it adequately informed
                            concerning recent increased military expenditures despite repeated
                            requests by United States officials for such information. United States
                            Government also disturbed over apparent intention of <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> to confront United States Government
                            with plan of military preparedness as fait accompli in disregard of

                        <p>The Problem</p>
                        <p>To estimate the prospects for Communist China over the next several years
                            with emphasis on the viability of the regime and trends in its foreign
                            policy.</p>
                        <pb n="222" xml:id="pg_222" facs="0258"/>
                        <p>Conclusions</p>
                        <p>1. The future course of events in Communist China will be shaped largely
                            by three highly unpredictable variables: the wisdom and realism of the
                            leadership, the level of agricultural output, and the nature and extent
                            of foreign economic relations. During the past few years all three
                            variables have worked against China. In 1958 the leadership adopted a
                            series of ill-conceived and extremist economic and social programs; in
                            1959 there occurred the first of three years of bad crop weather; and in
                            1960 Soviet economic and technical cooperation was largely suspended.
                            The combination of these three factors has brought economic chaos to the
                            country. Malnutrition is widespread, foreign trade is down, and
                            industrial production and development have dropped sharply. No quick
                            recovery from the regime's economic troubles is in sight. (Paras.
                            5-14)</p>
                        <p>2. Economic disasters have brought widespread disillusionment and
                            disaffection in their wake, but we believe that widespread organized
                            resistance to the regime is unlikely to develop. In any case, the
                            regime's monopoly on arms, organization, and communications is probably
                            sufficient to crush any incipient uprising. Communist China's armed
                            forces have experienced setbacks in their modernization program and
                            logistical capabilities, but, although there has been some decline in
                            morale, they will probably remain loyal to the regime. We believe that
                            by the end of the decade the Chinese Communists will have a limited
                            nuclear weapons and missile capability.<note n="1" xml:id="d107fn1">See

                        <p>3. We believe that over the next few years Communist China will follow
                            relatively conservative and rational policies of the kind recently
                            instituted, that the odds favor improved crop weather, and that
                            increased trade with Western Europe and Japan will partially compensate
                            for the severe reduction in Soviet economic and technical cooperation.
                            We therefore believe that the most likely prospect is for slow recovery
                            and a gradual resumption of economic growth. However, there is also a
                            possibility that the economic depression will continue, bringing
                            increasing problems for the regime, and there is a slimmer possibility
                            of fairly rapid recovery and economic expansion. In any case, over the
                            longer run, given communism's demonstrated inefficiency in agriculture,
                            it is possible that the regime will founder on a failure to solve
                            China's chronic food problem. (Paras. 15-20)</p>

                        <p>4. We believe that the US will continue to face a hostile Communist China
                            which will be constantly probing for weaknesses, trying to push the US
                            out of the Western Pacific, and causing trouble wherever else it can.
                            Meanwhile China will probably continue to promote the image of being a
                            strong but peaceful nation, while covertly providing tactical guidance
                            and material aid, to the extent of its capabilities, to leftist
                            revolutionary movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Outside the
                            Far East these capabilities are limited by China's poverty, relative
                            international isolation, and difficulties with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Communist China almost certainly
                            does not intend to attempt the open military conquest of any Far Eastern
                            country during the period of this estimate, although it would almost
                            certainly be willing to take military action to defend Communist
                            interests in North Vietnam and North Korea and, probably in Laos.

                                to increase tension, the De Haven had stayed outside even the

                            reminded <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> of aggressions his
                            side, notably Korea. Said while we seek disarmament, we would not disarm
                            unilaterally. Said to best my knowledge and belief President had not
                            spoken of and never intended speak of preventive war.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> then launched into

                            <item>The President, Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CRS1">Cline</persName>

                        </list>
                        <p>1. The President opened the discussion by inquiring about news reports
                            from Taipei of <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> support for the
                            Phoumi Government. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CRS1">Cline</persName>
                            reported that the news accounts were indicative of general moral and
                            political support and did not reflect any material support of any
                            consequence since the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> fully
                            understood U.S. wishes with respect to Laos and did not want to
                            encourage Phoumi to resist U.S. policy. In fact, the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> said they were advising Phoumi to
                            accommodate to U.S. policy, whether it was right or wrong. They wished
                            US to understand, however, that they felt a coalition in Laos would lead
                            to a communist takeover even as it had in China years ago.</p>
                        <p>2. With respect to the China Mainland situation, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CRS1">Cline</persName> said, the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> felt that the ChiCom system of public security controls
                            was beginning to crumble, as evidenced recently in the astonishing
                            throng of hungry refugees arriving by the thousands on the Hong Kong
                            border. This tended to confirm the Gimo in his belief that the time was
                            ripe or soon would be for establishing a beach-head in South China and
                            encouraging popular resistance against the ChiComs and winning back
                            sizable parts of the Mainland through defections from the armed forces,
                            whose morale is certainly being lowered by the food situation and
                            popular disillusionment with the ChiCom regime. The Gimo asked that
                            President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> be advised of
                            his views on this situation, which is of great strategic importance to
                            the U.S. as well as to the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>. The
                            President said that he recognized that if the ChiCom regime could be
                            destroyed, it would tremendously alter the situation in Asia to the
                            advantage of the Free World and that he did not want to dismiss this
                            possibility altogether even though it seemed unlikely at this time.</p>
                        <p>3. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CRS1">Cline</persName> explained that the
                            Gimo's main concepts, which he wished to be conveyed to the President,
                            were as follows: </p>
                        <p>a. A strategic agreement between President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> and President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> on policy and courses of action in Asia was
                            essential to the welfare and interest of both the U.S. and the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>.</p>
                        <pb n="228" xml:id="pg_228" facs="0264"/>
                        <p>b. The <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> feels it is essential for it
                            to plan and prepare for both clandestine and military actions to support
                            anti-Communist resistance forces on the Mainland, but it recognizes that
                            any action of this kind should be purely a <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> responsibility with no direct U.S. participation or
                            sponsorship.</p>
                        <p>c. Any sizable operations against the Mainland, whether clandestine or
                            open military in character, must be jointly decided upon by the U.S.
                            Government and the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> in the light of
                            the circumstances and conditions obtaining at the time of proposed
                            execution of the operation; all preparations in the meantime are purely
                            contingent in character.</p>
                        <p>d. In the light of the situation on the Mainland, the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> is obliged to take certain prudent
                            military preparedness measures to be ready to intervene in case the
                            situation deteriorates to the point where the U.S. agrees that action is
                            in Free World interest.</p>
                        <p>e. The psychological pressure in the top ranks of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>, particularly among the military, to do
                            something positive to take advantage of the lowering of morale on the
                            Mainland is intense, and the Gimo will increasingly encounter
                            dissatisfaction and even internal opposition that will be hard to
                            contain if he continues to postpone taking action against the Mainland;
                            he has promised to take no action until 1 October, but it will be very
                            difficult to postpone beyond this date even though the U.S. insists.</p>
                        <p>f. In the event further delays are necessary, it would help a great deal
                            to explain this to his own military leaders if the Gimo could point to
                            increased military strength being supplied by the U.S. even though its
                            use was contingent on U.S. agreement; thus enough C-123's to carry the
                            200-man team we have agreed to prepare for clandestine launch (5
                            aircraft—i.e. <gloss target="#t_ECM1">ECM</gloss> configured
                            C-123's—rather than the 2 set aside for this purpose) ought to be given
                            to the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>, as well as about 16 B-57's,
                            which would be needed to neutralize IL-28 bombers if hostilities broke
                            out, and a considerable number of <gloss target="#t_LST1">LST</gloss>'s
                            (75-100,000 tons, which would be 20-25 vessels) for amphibious forces.
                            The provision of any of these items would convince people actual
                            preparations were being made and would permit further delays to be
                            weathered more gracefully.</p>
                        <p>g. The Gimo considers good U.S.-<gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            relations are vital, and he regrets the recrimination over recent budget
                            and tax provisions the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> has made to
                            cover the military expenditures the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            has felt it essential to make ($62 million for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 62 and <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 63) to be
                            prepared for the contingency of an open invasion of South China by
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> armed forces in the next 18
                            months. These fiscal measures will be coordinated with the U.S. Embassy
                            and U.S. military aid officials, but the Gimo feels that the discussion
                            should be in terms recognizing the right of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> to make prudent preparations in its own national
                            security interest.</p>
                        <pb n="229" xml:id="pg_229" facs="0265"/>
                        <p>h. The Gimo said he was reluctant to get into detailed coordination of
                            these matters because he felt many U.S. officials were totally
                            unsympathetic with what the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            considered its national interest in assisting the Chinese people throw
                            off the yoke of the ChiCom regime if they were able and willing to do
                            so. He said he was willing to discuss and explain anything and to accept
                            U.S. advice if it was sympathetically given, preferably privately and
                            off the record. He said that he particularly hoped President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> would understand that threats
                            of reprisals and pressures in the form of restricting U.S. aid to the
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would be counter-productive and
                            would in fact only destroy the prestige of the Gimo's Government and
                            might cause instability and anti-Americanism in Taiwan. He wished the
                            President to know that he thought it was a mistake for the U.S. to use
                            open threats delivered through diplomatic channels against any Asian
                            leaders, as it caused them to lose face and either resist U.S. advice or
                            to become discredited with their own people. He thought the U.S. State
                            Department was increasingly inclined to threaten economic pressures
                            against any friendly government which disagreed with the U.S. It might
                            be necessary to use this kind of diplomatic and economic pressure on
                            some small and ineffective nations, although he doubted its wisdom, but
                            in any case the Gimo wished earnestly and with the friendliest of
                            purposes to advise the President that such pressures on the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would only serve to weaken
                            Sino-American cooperation and injure our common interests. If this
                            heavy-handed pressure could be avoided, the Gimo felt sure that a
                            reasonable accommodation could be worked out on any issues in
                            dispute.</p>

                        <p>For information concerning <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> 11-5-62,
                            see <ref target="#d99">Document 99</ref>. Kennan's comments in despatch
                            636 read in part as follows:</p>
                        <p>“In summary, it seems to me that Chinese-Soviet relations bid fair to
                            receive, in the coming period, a certain easement through the combined
                            effect of two separate sets of frustrations: those suffered by the
                            Chinese in the effort to realize their ambitious internal programs, and
                            those suffered by <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> in
                            his effort to establish ‘peaceful coexistence’ with the West as a real
                            and effective alternative of policy which would give him greater
                            flexibility in his relations with other bloc parties. The greater
                            modesty of aspiration which will be inflicted on both parties by these
                            failures should make it easier rather than harder for them to get on
                            together. Particularly is this true so long as the world is divided into
                            opposing military camps with the tendency running to increased
                            bipolarity. It is flexibility in the international situation, more than
                            anything else, that will bring out the latent divisions within the bloc.
                            An environment of continued sharp, military bipolarity will leave the
                            two partners little choice but to repress their differences and carry
                            on.” (Department of State, Central Files, 101.21-NIS/4-1162)</p>
                        <p>In his memorandum to <persName>Bundy</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName> stated that he had requested
                                <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName>'s comments on the
                            two papers and proceeded to state his own views, which he summarized as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p>“In the first place, the <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> paper on
                            which Kennan comments, dates from February of this year, when the
                            situation in regard to the Sino-Soviet dispute was somewhat different. I
                            am inclined to agree with <persName>George</persName> that it is
                            somewhat too optimistic in speaking of the odds on the avoidance of an
                            open split ‘during 1962’ are not better than even. Since that time, as
                            you know, there have been certain indications in Sino-Soviet relations
                            pointing towards a desire to agree to disagree and avoid the
                            consequences of a further exacerbation of these differences and the
                            dangers of a split, with all that that would entail. However, there is
                            not the slightest sign that any adjustment of the basic elements of that
                            dispute have been or are in process of adjustment. I, therefore, tend in
                            general to agree with <persName>George</persName>'s questioning of the
                            validity of so absolute a statement as contained in the <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> in question.”</p>
                        <p>After more detailed comments on Kennan's views, he concluded as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p>“In regard to this whole matter, there should be one word of caution
                            added; namely, that there is very little that the United States can do
                            profitably to its interests in regard to this dispute. It is, of course,
                            true that some agreement with the Soviet Union in any important area,
                            and I have particularly in mind Berlin and Germany, would be useful, but
                            in view of the insufficiency of our knowledge of the real factors in
                            operation between these countries, we certainly should not predicate any
                            policy on the fact of the Chinese-Soviet dispute. There is little
                            question but that we are observing a deep process of evolution inside
                            the Soviet camp, the outcome <pb n="231" xml:id="pg_231" facs="0267"/>of
                            which cannot possibly be accurately determined at this time, but at the
                            present moment, I see very little basis for any shift in our current
                            policy because of these developments.” (<persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> Library, National Security Files, Countries

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> replied in telegram 3070
                            from Moscow, May 26, that he had not yet received Kennan's comments. He
                            commented on <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> 11-5-62 in part as
                            follows: “Though I agree with basic line of <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> 11-5-62 I believe it somewhat exaggerates likelihood
                            Sino-Soviet break and consider this borne out by events since this paper
                            written. Similarly believe it underestimates possibilities of at least
                            temporary accommodations between the two parties. For example should
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> find his
                            leadership of Soviet Party threatened and have possibility maintain his
                            position by temporary accommodations to Chinese policy he would not
                            hesitate adopt it; even if accord were reached believe it would be
                            temporary in view of fundamental nature of issues.” (Department of

                        </list>
                        <p>The Problem:</p>
                        <p>To determine what action the US should take in view of the current
                            chronic food shortage on mainland China.</p>
                        <p>Discussion:</p>
                        <p>1. It is not in the US interest to bail Peiping's present leaders out of
                            their current difficulties. Making large quantities of grain available
                            to them on longer-term easy credit terms would tend to do so.</p>
                        <pb n="232" xml:id="pg_232" facs="0268"/>
                        <p>2. It is, however, against our interests to establish an historical
                            record of having stood between hungry people and foodstuffs which we
                            have in abundant surplus: This is not our traditional attitude and might
                            well be held against us in future relations with China.</p>
                        <p>3. There are bound to be among Chinese Communist leaders some who are
                            basically more, and others who are less, antagonistic towards the US, or
                            some who may believe in a tough policy towards the US and others who may
                            see advantages to China in a more conciliatory policy. By inaction we
                            would strengthen the hand of those advocating a line of maximum
                            antagonism; by suitable action we might encourage those who are at the
                            less hostile end of the spectrum—however narrow the spectrum.</p>
                        <p>4. It is not possible to identify individual leaders among the Chinese
                            Communists as being dissident elements to whom a separate channel of
                            communication should be sought.</p>
                        <p>5. The Chinese Communist regime would find it repugnant to accept gift
                            shipments of Free World grain. Repugnance would be greatest if the gift
                            were from the US Government.</p>
                        <p>6. Preliminary information from the Department of Agriculture suggests
                            Communist China probably will within the months immediately ahead
                            exhaust all substantial non-US sources of Free World grain. The
                            principal Free World grain suppliers are states which would welcome a
                            less rigid US policy towards China. While they might have mixed feelings
                            about our supplying grain to Communist China, regret at such development
                            would be tempered if their own stocks were low.</p>
                        <p>7. <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> objections might give us
                            difficulties, but the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> should not be
                            permitted to veto action on our part taken in our own interest.</p>
                        <p>8. The refugee influx into Hong Kong which has occurred this month has
                            dramatized hunger on the mainland.<note n="1" xml:id="d112fn1">In early
                                May the number of mainland Chinese apprehended crossing the land

                                100-200 per month to more than 2,000 in one 24-hour period.

                        <p>(1) Reports of widespread hunger on the Chinese mainland have led to
                            concern among Americans, who retain feelings of human friendliness

                        <p>(2) We are aware that food grains appear to be entering a period of tight

                            grains, we would be prepared to reconsider present US policies and

                                would probably be instructed to raise a new item of business at his

                                stated that the item should be raised as soon as it was possible to
                                do so in a normal and low-key manner and asked whether a U.S.
                                request for a meeting about the middle of June rather than on July
                                12 as scheduled would seem unusual. (Ibid., 611.93/5-3062) The
                                Embassy replied that since the meeting had been scheduled after July
                                1 at U.S. request, changing the date would indicate something
                                unusual. (Telegrams 1947 and 1962 from Warsaw, May 31 and June 2;
                                ibid., 611.93/5-3162 and 611.93/6-262, respectively) Telegram 1680
                                to Warsaw, June 4, agreed that the date should not be changed.

                        <p>This paper is in response to a request from Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> for a review of the situation
                            with examination of various US policy alternatives and their probable
                            consequences.</p>
                        <p>I. The Problem</p>
                        <p>Present <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> policy consists of closely
                            interrelated political and military objectives focusing on recovery of
                            the Chinese mainland. The political goals are continued assurance of US
                            support for the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> as it is now
                            constituted and guarantees that the US will not drift toward a
                            “two-China” policy. Militarily the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            seeks increased US material support and eventual US involvement in an
                            attempt to regain control of China.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> believes that an
                            uprising on the mainland is possible and that the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> can gain control of such a revolt,
                            perhaps initiating <pb n="234" xml:id="pg_234" facs="0270"/>it through
                            small-scale military action. However the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> recognizes that even if a spontaneous uprising should
                            occur, re-gaining control of the mainland would be impossible without
                            significant increases in the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> forces
                            and eventual US participation, at least at the logistical level. A
                            summary of <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> efforts to win increased
                            US support for operations against the mainland is included in an
                            appendix attached herewith.<note n="1" xml:id="d113fn1">Not printed, but
                                see the Supplement.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p> US estimates challenge the basis of <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            planning on three counts: (1) there is almost no chance that a mainland
                            uprising would extend beyond a single province, (2) there is even less
                            likelihood that such an uprising would follow <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> leadership, and (3) should a <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>-sponsored uprising actually threaten the Chinese
                            Communist regime, Russian intervention would almost certainly be
                            forthcoming. Thus <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> efforts face
                            either quick defeat or short-lived success. The accompanying risks for
                            US policy range from political embarrassment to a war of escalation.</p>
                        <p>II. <persName>Chiang</persName>'s Position</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> probably sees that
                            the US has no present intention of supporting a <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> attack. Under the circumstances, he can attempt
                            independent action or he can hope for a change in the situation which
                            would cause the US to re-examine its policy. This change could come from
                            increased tensions in Southeast Asia or from growing unrest in Communist
                            China. Having waited thirteen years, he probably feels that unilateral
                            action is not yet necessary. Waiting, however, requires that he keep the
                            US committed to support of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>, and
                            if possible, to strengthening its forces. At the same time, he must
                            avoid confronting the US with a basic decision wherein a later US
                            re-examination would be foreclosed through refusal of any further
                            support for preparations against the mainland.</p>
                        <p>As evidence of this delaying tactic, <persName>Chiang</persName>
                            apparently decided in mid-April to put off all offensive action until
                            after September since no US support was forthcoming this spring and the
                            environment might prove more auspicious in the fall. The Laotian crisis
                            undoubtedly strengthened this hope. Although possibly disappointed that
                            US troops did not enter Laos, <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            leaders probably see the deployment of US forces in Thailand as
                            indicating a stronger anti-communist stand than was originally
                            anticipated in Taipei. While this may reduce <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> suspicions of US actions as foreshadowing the
                            abandonment of <persName>Chiang</persName>, it increases the likelihood
                            that the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> will exploit this more
                            determined US posture by stepping up its requests for material
                            support.</p>
                        <p>The recent flood of refugees into Hong Kong provided further
                            encouragement for <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> hopes that a
                            sudden breakdown of Chinese <pb n="235" xml:id="pg_235" facs="0271"/>Communist controls will unleash ever widening disturbances. Even
                            though the exodus has ended, at least for the moment, it is probably
                            regarded in Taipei as proof of the unrest to be exploited in the very
                            target-areas selected for proposed <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            airdrops.</p>
                        <p>III. US Policy Alternatives</p>
                        <p>The US may respond to <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> demands for
                            support in its mainland aspirations in any of four general ways:
                            acquiescence, outright refusal, temporizing, and polite
                            postponement.</p>
                        <p>Acquiescence to <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> demands would relieve
                            immediate US-<gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> pressures. The <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would feel encouraged to exploit
                            mainland unrest as it saw fit, regardless of subsequent US warnings.
                            Defeat would end <persName>Chiang</persName>'s hopes forever, removing
                            this thorn in US-<gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> relations. Success,
                            if prolonged beyond a few days, would reveal the weakness of Communist
                            China. If Soviet intervention proved necessary, Peiping's claims to
                            Asian leadership would be thoroughly discredited. Against these
                            favorable considerations must be weighed the certainty of US political
                            involvement and the consequent embarrassment of relations with Asian and
                            European allies. Should UN censure strike at the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>, US interests would be affected. This combination of
                            military and political setbacks might compel <persName>Chiang</persName>
                            to resign, with no certainty of his successor's ability to rule Taiwan
                            as the Republic of China. Should <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            operations against the mainland be prolonged, the civil war might spread
                            or escalate. Hong Kong and Laos would be vulnerable to Chinese Communist
                            counter-pressures. Soviet intervention might confront the US with
                            abandonment of its ally or thermonuclear war.</p>
                        <p>Outright rejection would eliminate the ambiguity in US-<gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> relations. Direct or indirect
                            revelation of this move would lessen the US embarrassment should
                                <persName>Chiang</persName> go it alone. Indications of a <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> intent to violate the mutual defense
                            treaty obligations requiring joint approval of offensive military
                            operations could be answered with graduated sanctions through the
                            withholding of US economic and military aid. This open confrontation of
                                US-<gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> interests, however, might
                            strain relations to the breaking point. <persName>Chiang</persName>
                            might strike against the mainland with whatever force he could muster in
                            hope of winning a toehold. This would buy time for appealing directly to
                            his countrymen and for building political pressure within the US to
                            force a reversal of policy. Should he not go it alone,
                                <persName>Chiang</persName> might submit a token resignation in
                            symbolic protest against the US position, hoping that the domestic US
                            response would force a change of policy. Throughout this political
                            crisis in US-<gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> relations, Peiping
                            would intensify its efforts to collapse <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> morale, alternating between renewed threats of force
                            and offers of amnesty for those who rejoined the motherland.</p>
                        <p>Temporizing would delay an explicit US response concerning our ultimate
                            intentions while offering material and political tokens of our <pb n="236" xml:id="pg_236" facs="0272"/>sympathetic support for
                                <persName>Chiang</persName>'s goals. We would insist that two
                            prerequisites for offensive operations were (1) clear indication of
                            sufficient support on the mainland to guarantee <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> success and (2) demonstration of <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> realism in planning both the attack and
                            the subsequent pacification. This would ease US-<gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> tensions somewhat, depending upon the levels of
                            material assistance accompanying our temporizing. We would have an
                            opportunity to influence <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> planning
                            and would probably improve our information on <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> preparations for attack. So long as no significant
                            revolt occurred on the mainland, only minor crises would arise as each
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> request won partial and delayed
                            US agreement. Should a revolt begin, US involvement would have become
                            almost inextricable even if unilateral <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> action in violation of treaty obligations provided
                            legal justification for disengagement. In the eyes of many in the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>, Asia, and the US itself, our public
                            identification of American policy and interest with
                                <persName>Chiang</persName>, buttressed by our material support for
                            his forces, would require further support now that the opportunity for
                            regaining China lay at hand. Regardless of the risks identified with the
                            acquiescence alternative above, personal and institutional pressures
                            might well override previous intentions. Should we disavow the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> action, many observers would conclude
                            that the US nerve had weakened at the last moment. Other allies might
                            lose confidence in the US resolve to make genuine sacrifices for their
                            interests. The possibility of a <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> fait
                            accompli on the basis of these overall considerations cannot be wholly
                            discounted.</p>
                        <p>Polite postponement permits the US to insist that overriding
                            considerations connected with the unstable Southeast Asian situation
                            compel complete suspension of all steps in preparation against the
                            mainland, pending resolution of the Laotian crisis. Not only would
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> exacerbation of mainland unrest
                            jeopardize our joint interests through possibly provoking Peiping to
                            countermoves in Laos, but any indications of eventual action against the
                            mainland might persuade Peiping to raise the stakes in Southeast Asia as
                            a counter against subsequent <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> action.
                            Thus even token material support would be denied on the basis of its
                            possible effect on Chinese Communist authorities. The <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would insist that its forces could help
                            beleaguered Southeast Asian states by keeping Chinese Communist planners
                            insecure and that in case of a deepening crisis in Laos, diversionary
                            attacks in support of local uprisings could only strengthen Free Asia's
                            security. Since the US position did not foreclose eventual assistance
                            for mainland operations, <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> protests
                            might not strike too acrimonious a note. Requests for equipment would
                            reoccur, and should a coalition government eventuate in Laos, <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> pressures would mount. Uncertainty as
                            to the eventual US position, however, might caution against extreme
                            demands with tolerable levels of tension characterizing US-<gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> relations.</p>

                        <p>1. The considerations set forth in your memorandum of April 19<note n="1" xml:id="d114fn1">
                                <persName corresp="#p_MGGC1">McGhee</persName>'s April 19 memorandum
                                to <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> suggested a
                                review of the offshore islands problem, commenting that “if the
                                    <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> and/or US are ever to
                                disengage from the offshore islands this should be done before
                                Communist China's detonation of a nuclear device, which is expected
                                by 1963-64.” (Ibid., 893.1901/4-2062)</note> have prompted <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss> to take a fresh look at the Offshore
                            Islands problem. As you know, this is a question which has come under
                            review on several occasions during the past few years. We agree that
                            evacuation of the islands should be a United States objective and that
                            this should preferably be brought about before the Chinese Communists
                            have nuclear weapons.</p>
                        <p>2. At this juncture we see only two possibilities to bring about <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> evacuation of the Offshores: the offer
                            of an exceedingly attractive inducement, or the application of extreme
                            pressures to compel withdrawal. I believe the price for either
                            alternative would be exorbitant.</p>
                        <p>3. We might urge withdrawal in order to regain mobility for the troops so
                            that they could be used in an attack on the mainland. The proposal would
                            have to be coupled with a firm United States commitment at least to
                            agree to a <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> counterattack against the
                            mainland and perhaps also to give it full support. Otherwise the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would regard it as only a ploy. These
                            assurances the United States Government is obviously not prepared to
                            give, and I perceive no change in circumstances in the near future which
                            might make such an offer feasible.</p>
                        <p>4. The application of extreme pressures on the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>, such as the threat of flat disavowal of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>'s claim to the mainland, cessation of
                            military assistance, and/or possible denunciation of our Mutual Defense
                            Treaty might compel <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> withdrawal from
                            the Offshores. Given the current urge for the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> to go in the opposite direction—to return to the
                            mainland—such a result would require stronger pressures than ever
                            before. Such extreme pressures would involve the very real risk of
                            provoking the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> into a desperate and
                            possibly suicidal attack against the mainland. Alternatively, these
                            pressures might lead to the <pb n="238" xml:id="pg_238" facs="0274"/>resignation or involuntary removal from office of President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName>, quite probably followed
                            by a period of dangerous political instability. This period of
                            instability might even end in Communist control of Taiwan.</p>
                        <p>5. This being said, it should also be remarked that Peiping's fundamental
                            national interest would argue strongly against actual use of nuclear
                            weapons against the Offshore Islands. The Chinese Communists have made
                            much of the propaganda theme that Americans used the atomic bomb only
                            against Asians. For the Chinese Communists to use the nuclear weapon
                            against fellow Chinese would do them irretrievable psychological and
                            political damage around the world and among Chinese everywhere. Even if
                            the Communists were willing to accept this damage, they would probably
                            estimate that this course of action would precipitate a nuclear exchange
                            with the vastly superior forces of the United States. A Communist China
                            with some nuclear capability might, however, be bolder and more inclined
                            to take risks—against the Offshore Islands and elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>6. We shall, of course, remain alert for any developments which might
                            reasonably offer hope of inducing the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> to withdraw from the Offshores. We would point out that
                            the Offshore Islands policy of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            is inextricably connected with its other policies, of which that calling
                            for the return to the mainland is central. Accordingly, the alteration
                            in circumstances which made evacuation possible would have to be
                            radical. If we are to alter the circumstances instead of waiting on
                            events, we shall have to alter radically main policies towards the
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>. The Offshore Islands may well
                            become a side issue in a perhaps inevitable showdown over the whole
                            project of return to the mainland. If the timing of such a showdown is
                            to be decided by the United States, the decision will have to be made on
                            the basis of domestic as well as external political considerations, and
                            at the highest level.<note n="2" xml:id="d114fn2">

                                    <persName>Bundy</persName> reported on a May 22 meeting of

                                representatives. The draft telegram stated that the substance of
                                    <persName>Chiang</persName>'s May 15 meeting with <persName corresp="#p_CRS1">Cline</persName> had been passed to <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>, that <persName corresp="#p_KAAG1">Kirk</persName> would be prepared to discuss

                                when he arrived in Taipei, and that <persName corresp="#p_KAAG1">Kirk</persName> would have full responsibility as the
                                President's representative for handling all major policy problems.
                                It also stated that the initial reaction to
                                    <persName>Chiang</persName>'s request for landing ships and
                                bombers was not favorable but further <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> intelligence effort on the mainland and further
                                    U.S.-<gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> consultation would be
                                desirable. <persName corresp="#p_BWH1">Brubeck</persName>'s
                                memorandum stated that it had been agreed that <persName corresp="#p_KAAG1">Kirk</persName> should tell
                                    <persName>Chiang</persName> that five C-123's would be prepared
                                but would remain in the United States until it was decided to use
                                them.</note> Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName> explained that the
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> had recently requested two more
                            C-123's, 70-100,000 tons of LST's and 16 B-57's.<note n="2" xml:id="d115fn2">The requests were summarized in an unsigned and

                            answer this request and (2) to indicate that after his arrival in Taipei
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KAAG1">Kirk</persName> would be the

                            question from the President, said the 70,000 tons of <gloss target="#t_LST1">LST</gloss>'s would be the equivalent of
                            approximately 35 ships, each capable of carrying a platoon of tanks or
                            an enlarged infantry company.</p>

                        <p>Both Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KAAG1">Admiral Kirk</persName> suggested that we had no information that a
                            drop of a 20-man team or a 200-man team on the mainland of China could
                            survive. It was more likely, according to <persName corresp="#p_KAAG1">Admiral Kirk</persName>, that this request was being made simple as
                            a means of dragging us into <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> plans
                            for an invasion of the mainland.</p>
                        <p>The President stated that he did not want the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> to be able to say that just as they were prepared to go
                            to the mainland, the United States flunked out. The President would
                            rather be in the position of saying that hard intelligence indicated
                            that a landing on the mainland was doomed to failure, or that the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> had refused to cooperate in getting the
                            essential intelligence on internal conditions on the mainland.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KAAG1">Admiral
                                Kirk</persName> both suggested, and the President agreed, that the
                                <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> should prepare a list of
                            specific actions to be taken in order to secure more intelligence on the
                            mainland. This would have the purpose of stimulating the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> either to collect the necessary
                            intelligence, or, if they refused, of building a record of
                            non-cooperation.</p>
                        <p>The President agreed with <persName corresp="#p_KAAG1">Admiral
                                Kirk</persName> that we should not contemplate taking any public
                            action, such as sending ships or bombers, without hard intelligence.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName> observed in connection with joint
                            planning with the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> we should remember
                            that their security might not be too effective. We must assume, he said,
                            that some of the planning could leak to the Russians.</p>
                        <p>In response to a question from the President, <persName corresp="#p_CLGMS1">General Carter</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FGD1">FitzGerald</persName> both said that the five
                            C-123's which would be prepared would also be of use to their agency in

                        <p>“Memorandum for the record of a discussion between President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> on Tuesday June 5, 1962.</p>
                        <p>The meeting extended from 10:00 to 12:30 pm. After an exchange of
                            pleasantries the entire substance of the conversation dealt with the
                            question of President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName>'s
                            intention to launch operations of various types with the object of
                            destroying the Chinese Communist regime and liberating his people.</p>
                        <p>The Generalissimo made it abundantly clear that for the past thirteen
                            years his sole purpose, and that of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>, had been to prepare for a victorious return to the
                            Mainland. To this end he had created on Taiwan a government which
                            represented free China, built a military machine capable of exploiting
                            the deterioration of Communist control on the Mainland, worked to create
                            an expectation of deliverance among the Chinese people now under
                            Communist rule, and maintained faith in ultimate victory among his
                            adherents on Taiwan.</p>
                        <p>The President then declared his conviction that conditions on the
                            Mainland had so deteriorated that operations on a reasonable scale, if
                            properly executed, would be supported by the populace and would succeed
                            in establishing control of an area which by further efforts on a larger
                            scale would expand over all of South China and would ultimately topple
                            the Communist regime. This belief, he said, was shared by all his
                            followers on Taiwan giving rise to almost irresistible pressure upon him
                            to act. This pressure, plus his own deep feeling of responsibility to
                            his people on the Mainland, had impelled him to now prepare for initial
                            operations. These were originally scheduled to take place in April-May
                            of this year. He had been persuaded by the United States Government to
                            postpone these attempts for six months. However he could not delay
                            beyond this time and will have to be fully prepared to act in October.
                            He <pb n="242" xml:id="pg_242" facs="0278"/>therefore strongly urged
                            that all preparations be made during the intervening months so that his
                            people on Taiwan and his followers on the Mainland would know that he
                            was prepared and would act if conditions existent in October warranted
                            action.</p>
                        <p>The Generalissimo then stated:</p>
                        <p>1. That under no circumstances would he undertake a reckless operation or
                            one which did not offer a reasonable chance of success. Any move made by
                            the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> to recover the Mainland would be
                            carefully thought through and properly planned.</p>
                        <p>2. He would not undertake any formal military operations without
                            consultation and concurrence with the United States Government.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> questioned the
                            Generalissimo on the term “formal military operations,” asking whether
                            prospective drops of several teams of two or three hundred men
                            constituted in the Generalissimo's opinion a formal military action. The
                            Generalissimo responded that in his opinion such drops would not fall
                            under the definition of formal action and would therefore not require
                            U.S. concurrence. Large-scale amphibious operations, by contrast, would
                            constitute a formal military action and would, under the terms of the
                            treaty, require concurrence. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> took exception to this position, stating it was
                            his view that a two hundred man drop was a sizeable operation and one
                            which would be attributable to both the United States Government and the
                            GRC. Therefore any such operation must be fully coordinated and agreed
                            between the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>. It was finally agreed that the
                            sizeable airdrop operation would require consultation and
                                concurrence.<note n="2" xml:id="d116fn2">This sentence was not in

                        </p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> went on to stress the
                            vital importance of success in any operation on a major scale such as
                            large air drops. Failure in such an attempt would be a catastrophic
                            setback to the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>, place the future of
                            Formosa in doubt and the net result would be to give added momentum to
                            the Communist movement in China and Southeast Asia. He repeatedly
                            expressed concern that a large air drop or sizeable amphibious operation
                            would encounter large, well-equipped Chinese Communist military forces
                            loyal to the regime and the ChiNat forces would be destroyed and the
                            civilians who joined the insurgent effort slaughtered as they were in
                            Hungary. He therefore again emphasized the importance of gathering hard
                            intelligence before launching any sizeable attack on the Mainland and
                            urged that Communist combat units in the southern and central provinces
                            were prime targets for penetration and intelligence efforts. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> indicated that if the
                            Generalissimo felt that <pb n="243" xml:id="pg_243" facs="0279"/>commitments of food would help to neutralize or disaffect Communist
                            military units his views should be discussed with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KAAG1">Kirk</persName> promptly on his arrival.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> agreed that an
                            intense intelligence effort should be initiated (and apparently has
                            given orders to this effect) but went on to point out that in his
                            opinion intelligence alone could not provide all the information needed
                            to gauge the chances for success in that reconquest of the Mainland by
                            the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> was a revolutionary movement
                            which would gather momentum as it succeeded. True knowledge of the
                            Mainland reaction, he contended, could only be gained after a sizeable
                            military operation had been launched, an area secured, and the people
                            together with their local leaders given reason to hope for relief from
                            oppression. In any other situation popular resistance to the Communists
                            would continue to be passive.</p>
                        <p>At this point the Generalissimo spoke of his dilemma with regard to
                            obtaining United States Government approval for his actions, indicating
                            that this area always presented him with an uncertainty and therefore
                            foreclosed proper dynamic planning of operations. He went so far as to
                            state that he could conceive of a situation under which he would have to
                            free himself of the restrictions imposed on him in his role as head of
                            state by stepping down to a position from which he could lead an
                            independent revolutionary movement. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> interpreted this not as a threat but as a
                            reflection upon earlier days when the Generalissimo had taken similar
                            steps on the Mainland.</p>
                        <p>At no point during the conversation did the Generalissimo say or intimate
                            that he felt that the United States had an obligation to join him with
                            American combat forces nor did he indicate that he expected such
                            assistance; however he made it abundantly clear he expected the U.S. to
                            give him logistic support even though there was no formal obligation to
                            do this. In discussing the question of American support for <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> efforts to recover the Mainland Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> advised the
                            Generalissimo that two C-123 aircraft were being prepared, that training
                            for <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> aircrews had been approved, and
                            that the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> request for three
                            additional C-123's was under consideration. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> indicated that Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_KAAG1">Kirk</persName> would be able to advise
                            the Generalissimo concerning these three additional aircraft when he
                            arrived in Taipei. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName>
                            said that no decision had been reached concerning provision of B-57
                            bombers and <gloss target="#t_LST1">LST</gloss>'s for <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> but that President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName>'s request for these weapons would
                            be considered when an agreement had been reached concerning the
                            operations in which they would be used. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> pointed out that this was actually a matter
                            beyond his competence as Director of Central Intelligence.</p>
                        <p>The discussion throughout was exploratory and very frank (President
                                <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> stated that the
                            exchange was the most complete in many <pb n="244" xml:id="pg_244" facs="0280"/>years) but at no time was the question of U.S. policy
                            taken up, nor did the Generalissimo ask or Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> volunteer information about
                            what the U.S. position might be under hypothetical future circumstances.
                            All this was left for subsequent discussions with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KAAG1">Kirk</persName> and it was made perfectly clear
                            that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName>'s mission had to
                            do only with intensifying the intelligence effort as a preface to any
                            larger decision or action.”</p>

                        <p>Problem now as we see it is to find ways of continuing to emphasize US

                            be minimized and of inducing <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> to
                            reduce or stretch out future military spending. Situation appears to
                            require coordinated action along three lines:</p>
                        <p>1. Re economic assistance we should continue proceed with caution not
                            only to assure that approved programs are in accord with new situation
                            but also to maintain impression that we are not relaxed in accepting
                            non-performance of commitment to restrain defense expenditures and
                            continue to be concerned that expenditures and economic impact be
                            minimized. In this line would suggest no action for time being on
                            long-term Title I agreement, proceeding with deliberation in
                            implementation program loan, and parallel attitude with respect to
                            smaller aid projects.</p>
                        <p>2. <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> review of information provided
                            by <gloss target="#t_MND1">MND</gloss> on special expenditures shows
                            very small proportion of purchases to date are items programmed for
                            future <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> delivery. Action with respect
                            such items and other elements military expenditures will be discussed
                            with Chief <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> on his return from
                            Washington appropriate recommendations made.</p>
                        <p>3. We should seek authoritative reaffirmation <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> still considers valid its commitment to limit military
                            expenditures as specified under 19 <pb n="246" xml:id="pg_246" facs="0282"/>points and that other commitments there stipulated
                            which form basis of accelerated development program must also be
                            honored. In effect this would be a return to the status quo ante after
                            special preparedness program. This might be appropriate topic for
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KAAG1">Kirk</persName> to take up with

                        <p>1. The Director and the Deputy Director (Plans) met with the President at
                            4:05 P.M., 18 June, to report on the trip to Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p>2. The President opened the conversation by asking if we knew where
                            Joseph Alsop had got his information about the build-up of ChiCom
                            divisions in the Fukien area. We said that we did not know [<hi rend="italic">2 lines of source text not declassified</hi>]. The
                            President asked whether it would not be desirable to conduct an
                            investigation as to how Alsop had acquired this knowledge. The Director
                            commented that he did not think an investigation would be fruitful but
                            that he would like to take the matter under advisement for consideration
                            with <gloss target="#t_USIB1">USIB</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>[Here follows discussion of an intelligence operation, not identified in
                            the memorandum.]</p>
                        <p>4. The Director described his conversations in Taiwan with <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName>, the President having
                            stated that he had read with interest the Director's report from the
                            field on this subject. When the Director had finished, the President
                            wondered out loud what <persName>Chiang</persName> would do if he were
                            told flatly that the United States would not support him in any military
                                <pb n="247" xml:id="pg_247" facs="0283"/>operation against the
                            Mainland. It was agreed that <persName>Chiang</persName> might then “go
                            it alone.” DD/P described <persName>Chiang</persName>'s belief that the
                            Soviets would not intervene as long as the ChiNats conducted their
                            military operations south of the Yangtse River. The President mused
                            about this and expressed the opinion that Soviet air support could
                            readily be brought to bear on the side of the ChiComs. No conclusions
                            were reached on what should be done to support
                                <persName>Chiang</persName>, although the Director expressed the
                            view, already presented to the Secretary of State and the Secretary of
                            Defense, that the United States Government should start to stockpile air
                            and amphibious equipment while maintaining control over it.<note n="1" xml:id="d118fn1">

                        </list>
                        <p>I. Chinese Communist Intentions</p>
                        <p>Reports of additional troop movements over the weekend lead us to take a
                            somewhat more serious view of Chinese Communist intentions than we did
                            initially.</p>
                        <pb n="248" xml:id="pg_248" facs="0284"/>
                        <p>In brief, our conclusions are as follows:</p>
                        <p>1. We still feel that the primary purposes of the reported movements are
                            to deter the Chinese Nationalists from attacking the mainland and to
                            ensure that defenses opposite Taiwan are adequate for all
                            contingencies.</p>
                        <p>2. However, we are now inclined to believe it is also likely that the
                            Chinese Communists have decided to exploit the troop movements
                            politically by creating a new offshore island crisis. To the Chinese
                            Communists a new crisis may appear useful for several reasons: to
                            exacerbate the visible strains in relations between the U.S. and
                            Nationalist China; to divert attention from domestic economic
                            difficulties and justify stringent measures at home; and to demonstrate
                            that Peiping's power and interests are something the world must reckon
                            with.</p>
                        <p>3. We cannot rule out the possibility that the Chinese Communists are
                            preparing for a sudden, all-out effort to take either or both Quemoy
                            (Kinmen) and Matsu, perhaps utilizing equipment not available in 1958.
                            However, in the absence of evidence that the Chinese Communists are
                            massing the necessary transport (e.g. motorized junks), we do not think
                            a sudden, all-out attack is either imminent or likely.</p>
                        <p>II. Implications for the U.S.</p>
                        <p>This Chinese Communist military buildup opposite Kinmen and Matsu brings
                            to the forefront not only the problem of the offshore islands themselves
                            but also of <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName>'s
                            intentions to “counterattack” the mainland. A direct confrontation of
                            the U.S. and Chinese Nationalist interests seems very likely.</p>
                        <p>If the Chinese Communists attack, the US will be faced with pressure from
                                <persName>Chiang</persName>, from his friends in Southeast Asia, and
                            from his friends here in the United States to participate in the defense
                            of the islands. A decision will be immediately required on whether or
                            not the attack is a preliminary to an attack on Formosa, as specified in
                            the Formosa Resolution, and <persName>Chiang</persName> undoubtedly will
                            make public all sorts of “intelligence” designed to show that it is.</p>
                        <p>If the Chinese Communists do not actually attack, but create a 1958-style
                            politico-military crisis, the situation is only slightly better.
                                <persName>Chiang</persName>'s demands will be urgent, and if support
                            is not forthcoming, they will undoubtedly become both public and
                            strident.</p>
                        <p>The Chinese Communists have considerable incentive to exacerbate
                            US-Chinese Nationalist relations and can begin at any time.
                                <persName>Chiang</persName>, on the other hand, has always had among
                            his high priority objectives involvement of the US in reconquest of the
                            mainland. Once the Chinese Communists are in position, he may provoke an
                            attack or in other ways take the initiative to exploit the situation for
                            his own purposes.</p>
                        <pb n="249" xml:id="pg_249" facs="0285"/>
                        <p>Thus the initiative would appear to be with the Chinese, either Communist
                            or Nationalist, once Peiping's troops are fully in position. If
                            preventive or interposing action should be necessary to safeguard US
                            interests, it would appear that such action may be a realistic
                            alternative for only a very limited time.</p>

                                    6:01 p.m. and ended at 6:17 p.m. (<persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> Library)</note>

                        <p>1.

                        <p>2. Knoche described in considerable detail the nature of the evidence of
                            Chinese Communist military buildup in the Taiwan Strait area. [<hi rend="italic">5 lines of source text not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>3. The extent of buildup was described. In response to his questions the
                            President was told that so far only 15 jet fighters, no bombers, have
                            moved in, but that we expect more.</p>
                        <p>4. There was a discussion of the status and capability of the ChiCom navy
                            in the Taiwan Strait area. The distinction was made between Matsu, the
                            taking of which would require modern amphibious equipment, and Quemoy,
                            which is in effect a river-crossing and could be assaulted with the
                            myriad of junks and other assorted craft in the area. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> described the topography and
                            fortification of Quemoy.</p>
                        <pb n="250" xml:id="pg_250" facs="0286"/>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">General Taylor</persName> cited the
                            security surrounding Chinese Communist military movements in the Korean
                            War and asked if we didn't think that the Chinese were being more “open”
                            in this case. Knoche's reply was that the information is reliable
                            deduction [<hi rend="italic">2 lines of source text not

                        <p>6. A brief discussion of past Taiwan Strait crises ensued, with various
                            comments concerning events in August-September 1958. The President asked
                                <persName corresp="#p_FMV1">Forrestal</persName> to check to see
                            what decisions were made by the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> at
                            that time.</p>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">General Taylor</persName> suggested, and
                            it was later agreed, to hold a meeting with the President at 6:00 p.m.,
                            20 June, with representation from State, Defense and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>.<note n="2" xml:id="d120fn2">See <ref target="#d122">Document 122</ref>.</note>

                                Communists had moved seven army divisions, with possibly five more
                                on the way, across the Strait from Taiwan, representing “the largest
                                such movement since the Korean War.” The scale and urgency of the
                                troop movements appeared too large to be merely a demonstration to
                                deter <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> raids. The <gloss target="#t_SNIE1">SNIE</gloss> concluded that the movements were
                                either defensive, designed to put pressure on the offshore islands,
                                or intended for a surprise attack on the Chinmens. (Central

                            right; I was in the President's office right after the meeting; he <pb n="252" xml:id="pg_252" facs="0288"/>asked Mac Bundy, <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">George Ball</persName>, and I to step in, and

                            intelligence community and he said this was pretty silly, and of course
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> understands the
                            facts and figures business, this is his business; so he said there were
                            300 motorized junks, and 1300 sailing vessels, take 50 men each; this
                            means that the most you can do is 100,000; you'd have to go back, and
                            couldn't move heavy equipment; with <gloss target="#t_LST1">LST</gloss>'s and he thinks this is for the birds; now, of course, this
                            puts <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> in a terrible position because
                                <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> had presented it in a
                            way, and the President asked questions, so that obviously the President
                            was looking at this one as that which he had to be most fearful of; and
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> jumped all over
                            him; then <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> came in and
                            the same thing; downgrading it, the idea of the third possibility; very
                            heavily, and <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName>, he said
                            there are three possible explanations for this; maybe they will attack
                            Taiwan, and nobody even suggested this; and to draw people away from
                            Southeast Asia; to try to get us out of SEA; they jumped all over this
                            and <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said he had several
                            recommendations to make; he wanted to bring two more SAC U-2s into
                            Formosa; we gotta have intelligence; have no intelligence; implications
                            that <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> has been doing a lousy job,
                            make judgments on the wrong facts; <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> didn't defend himself very well, talked a little
                            bit about the weather problems, and President asked—can't you fly lower
                            and got off into a kind of hassle about the technique of getting air
                            photos, with <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> not much in focus. He
                            didn't defend himself very well.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> was—if you wanted to
                            lose a few lives, you might still do it subtleties—and I wasn't about to
                            step in at that point, to defend a course of action, I had busily fought
                            his people all morning. And then even <persName corresp="#p_KAAG1">Kirk</persName> spoke up that this was quite an operation, and he
                            is an amphibious warfare expert, but he ended up on the right note
                            saying if you wanted to spend enough lives, you could probably do it.
                            The nearest Defense came off the better of this exchange. Mac Bundy
                            asked if there was anybody in this Intelligence [community?] and <gloss target="#t_USIB1">USIB</gloss> who was taking the line that it was
                            possible for it to be a surprise attack; was it potential Pearl Harbor
                            and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> said no one did.
                            And this amazed me for this is exactly what Fitzh<note n="5" xml:id="d122fn5">Possibly <persName corresp="#p_FGD1">Desmond
                                    FitzGerald</persName>.</note> was arguing. So I didn't say
                            anything to that but it looked awfully funny with Defense (<persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>) <pb n="253" xml:id="pg_253" facs="0289"/>joining hands here; opposing this thing that the
                            Defense (Navy and Army) Navy supported the Army a little bit; this was
                            weird, and <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> did say that
                            he hadn't had a chance to get together with his people (intelligence)
                            and that will be interesting when that happens. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> recommended keeping the 4th
                            Carrier in the Pacific which it was due to come back apparently moving a
                            couple of carriers into the Straits, bringing two more U-2s to Formosa;
                            I didn't quite get the reason for this and it was some time before that
                            it turns out that his real reason is not a bad one; which is, that if
                            there is a clear day that we deploy all 4 simultaneously and make the
                            most of it. These are SAC having ChiNat pilots; cause they have
                                4—<persName corresp="#p_CRS1">Ray Cline</persName> raised the
                            possibility of deploying them and hiding them in the hangar, but they
                            said, put them in Okinawa, Clark Field or someplace like that.<note n="6" xml:id="d122fn6">

                                recommended “(a) augmentation of carrier strength by retaining
                                fourth carrier in 7th Fleet which had been due to return to the
                                United States; (b) deployment of carriers closer to Taiwan; (c)

                            considered. The memorandum states that <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> “raised the possibility of deploying U.S. air

                            thought it unnecessary. The carrier returned to the United States early

                            made the State Department look good was that I spoke up to the JIC
                            estimate and a couple of things; after the meeting I said a couple of
                            more things; but I was keeping my head down in this one because there
                            was almost nothing that I could say to correct <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> or <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> without appearing to defend
                            a position we wouldn't ourselves support; and there was no possible way
                            for me to put him in perspective without looking like I was defending
                            something we wouldn't want to defend.</p>
                        <p>You know that it was going to be an all-out Pearl Harbor assault on

                            so I kept my mouth shut on this one; and I supplied some things about

                                included proposals to try to deter an attack by approaching the

                                attack could lead to wider hostilities. The second proposed that the
                                U.S. response to an attack should be calculated “to localize the
                                conflict and terminate it as swiftly as possible with the islands

                        <p>Afterwards I took occasion to chat with <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and to give him some political reasons to
                            support his own position. To get a little back in his good graces. So
                            this was very friendly little chat with <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>,
                            and myself. I went in with the President and Mac and talked about the

                                tell “some responsible people” about the situation; most of the
                                White House press corps had left, and Salinger talked to the

                        <p>Now, we went back to <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">George Ball</persName>'s
                            office afterwards and got ourselves in line; <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> would like two decisions at the moment; one is
                            a decision that we will in fact restrain <persName>Chiang</persName>;
                            how far we are prepared to go on this one; and how much we are prepared
                            to tell the Russians on this one. But he also wants advance permission
                            to support the defense of the <pb n="255" xml:id="pg_255" facs="0291"/>islands if the Chinese Communists attack it. Not nuclear weapons or
                            anything like that but to make—if Chinese Coms do attack Quemoy and
                            Matsu that the US helps the Chinese Nationalists to the extent of making
                            it awfully expensive for them.</p>
                        <p>He wants these two decisions so he can talk to <persName corresp="#p_DA1">Dobrynin</persName>; he doesn't want to threaten <persName corresp="#p_DA1">Dobrynin</persName>; just wants to ask a question
                            at stage one.</p>
                        <p>A somewhat more harmonious message through the British to the Chinese
                            Communists but in stage two with <persName corresp="#p_DA1">Dobrynin</persName> he wants to be able to tell him the first time
                            around with <persName corresp="#p_DA1">Dobrynin</persName>—he'd like to
                            know what our decisions are and just say, just ask him, what about this
                            and say here we are, peace in Southeast Asia, Laos agreement, and what
                            are your boys doing out there.</p>
                        <p>Exactly why <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> wants it
                            faced. (others talking)</p>
                        <p>He may not and may not get it in this point of the scenario.</p>
                        <p>That could be. Well the exercise right now; what <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> and <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss> are doing right now is what he would be saying to
                                <persName corresp="#p_DA1">Dobrynin</persName>. In the meantime
                                <persName corresp="#p_YJA1">Yager</persName> and Company and
                                <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> are going to do
                            contingency planning, various contingencies; <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> has the idea that in 1958 we
                            didn't let them bomb the airfields from which the planes were taking
                            off, we ought to let them bomb those airfields this time. Pretty major
                            step and he wouldn't necessarily recommend it, but he is thinking about
                            it. This was just in chatting.</p>

                        <p>Director <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> briefed General
                                <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> on recent
                            intelligence indications of a substantial military buildup by the
                            Chinese Communists in Fukien Province (see <gloss target="#t_SNIE1">SNIE</gloss> 13-5-62).<note n="1" xml:id="d123fn1">See <ref target="#d122fn1">footnote 1, Document 122</ref>.</note> General
                                <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> speculated whether
                            this buildup could be a reaction to statements by the ChiNats that they
                            intended operations against the Mainland. Director <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> said that this was a
                            possibility. However the purpose of the buildup was not definitely
                            known, but (according to the <gloss target="#t_SNIE1">SNIE</gloss>)
                            could be (a) response to fear of landings from Taiwan; (b) resumption of
                            a campaign of pressure on the Offshore Islands similar to that which
                            occurred in 1958; and (c) a deliberate assault on the Offshore Islands
                            in the immediate future. Director <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> said that the urgency and scale of the military
                            preparations strongly supported the last possibility.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> gave his
                            opinion that the disposition of ChiCom forces in Fukien Province would
                            indicate whether their intentions were defensive or offensive. A
                            defensive posture would probably involve a spreading out of military
                            units up and down the coast with reserves fanned out in the rear
                            echelons. An offensive posture would suggest a heavy concentration of
                            troops in the immediate vicinity of the target.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> also emphasized
                            that an invasion of Quemoy could hardly be carried out without an
                            intensive artillery bombardment in advance. He said that he estimated
                            that such a barrage would probably have to be continued for at least 72
                            hours, although possibly by an extremely heavy effort a “time-on-target”
                            type barrage would shorten the time. General <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> recollected the bombardment and the investing
                            of the island of Pantelleria during the campaign in the Mediterranean.
                            Despite intensive naval and air bombardment lasting for 3 or 4 days,
                            relatively little actual damage was done to the gun emplacements on the
                            island. Nevertheless the garrison on the island surrendered without
                            resisting a landing, because their morale had been badly shaken and
                            because communications and utilities had been destroyed.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> then turned to
                            the diplomatic problems involved in the defense of the Offshore Islands.
                            He recalled that in 1958 the ChiComs had made numerous propaganda
                            statements to the effect that it was their intention to recapture
                            Taiwan. In the light of these statements it was possible for his
                            Administration to construe an attack upon Quemoy and Matsu as the first
                            stage of an attack upon the Mainland. General <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> recalled that his and Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName>' statements indicated
                            this intention, but he never made a categorical statement to this
                            effect. General <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>
                            observed that today the President's position was somewhat more
                            difficult, because there has so far been less propaganda <pb n="257" xml:id="pg_257" facs="0293"/>relating the current buildup to a
                            conquest of Formosa. Under these circumstances the President might wish
                            to go back to Congress for the authority to commit the United States to
                            the defense of the Offshore Islands.<note n="2" xml:id="d123fn2">At this
                                point, <persName corresp="#p_FMV1">Forrestal</persName>'s original
                                draft included the following sentence: “General <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> did not feel that this
                                was a necessity.”</note> Of course with Congress in session, time
                            was not so much of a problem. Also, if the ChiComs attack Taiwan by air
                            or if they came in too close on reconnaissance, the original resolution
                            would suffice as basis for our intervention.</p>
                        <p>In response to a question from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FMV1">Forrestal</persName>, General <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> said that the United States could probably
                            aid in the defense of Quemoy by non-combative means, such as supply, as
                            we had done in 1958, without resorting to Congress, although
                            consultations with the leadership would be desirable.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> also observed
                            that it would be hard to stay out of the defense of Quemoy if the action
                            there was prolonged and bloody.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> said that he
                            approved the idea of a warning to the ChiComs to the effect that in the
                            event of an attempt by them to begin operations against Taiwan, “the
                            U.S. would do its part.”</p>
                        <p>The former President recollected that he had asked
                                <persName>Chiang</persName> to evacuate civilians from the Islands
                            of Quemoy and Matsu and make them into strong island fortresses, using a
                            minimum number of troops to do so. Director <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> observed that the Island of Quemoy had been
                            historically a fortress for Chinese who had been driven off the Mainland
                            and consequently was of considerable psychological importance to
                                <persName>Chiang</persName>. General <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> observed that such a fortress would be of

                        <p>Director <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> asked whether
                            General <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> had supported
                                <persName>Chiang</persName>'s return to the Mainland. General
                                <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> replied that the
                            policy of his Administration was to avoid that question. His policy was
                            composed of the following elements: (1) the preservation of the security
                            of Taiwan and the Pescadores; (2) support of <persName>Chiang</persName>
                            in order to support the morale of the overseas Chinese; (3) maintenance
                            of <persName>Chiang</persName>'s ability to conduct operations on the
                            Mainland but always under our complete control. Former President
                                <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> recalled that he
                            had revised President Truman's orders to the 7th Fleet (“unleashing
                                <persName>Chiang</persName>”) as a warning to the ChiComs that
                            aggressive acts on their part might be countered by activities on their
                            own territory.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> summed up by
                            saying that he was delighted to have been given this briefing. The
                            general feeling he had was that we should be intensely watchful and
                            alert—on the qui vive. There was time to decide the U.S. reaction.</p>

                        <p>Approach to Russians</p>
                        <p>I would suggest that <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> be
                            authorized to call in <persName corresp="#p_DA1">Dobrynin</persName>
                            (preferably at lunch) and informally request information on what the
                            Soviets know about ChiCom troop movements in the Fukien area and what
                            their objectives are. He would state that because of the agreement
                            between the President and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> on Laos, we had assumed <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had no desire for military
                            action at this time over the off-shore islands. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> would indicate to the
                            Ambassador that in case the Soviets or ChiComs were concerned regarding
                            rumors of ChiNat preparations for mainland invasion, the U.S. had no
                            intention of supporting such a move under existing circumstances. He
                            would point out that ChiNats had agreed not to take any offensive action
                            without full consultation and prior agreement on the part of the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>In this connection, he would also note that in our meetings with the
                            Chinese Communists since 1955, we have consistently been urging
                            agreement that force not be used by either side to change the existing
                            situation, and of course we continue to adhere to that position.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, he would mention the defensive treaty with the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> and, therefore, refer to the dangers of
                            any aggressive action on the part of the ChiComs. The conversation
                            should be more of an inquiry than a demarche.</p>
                        <p>Approach to Chinese Communists</p>
                        <p>We should make sure that the Chinese Communists do not act under a
                            misunderstanding of our intentions.</p>
                        <p>While approach to the ChiComs might be made through Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CJM1">Cabot</persName> to [Chinese] Communist Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName>, I think it would be
                            better to try to use the British Embassy in Peiping, both because the
                            ChiCom response could be faster and because the ChiComs might be more
                            willing to talk frankly with the British.</p>
                        <pb n="259" xml:id="pg_259" facs="0295"/>
                        <p>Subject to your approval, I propose that we call in the British
                            Ambassador and discuss with him the Chinese Communist military build-up
                            in Fukien. If the British Ambassador believes that an approach by their
                            Embassy in Peiping to the Chinese Communists would be useful, we could
                            suggest to him the line that might be taken.</p>
                        <p>The British might call the attention of the Chinese Communists to the
                            Mutual Defense Treaty between the U.S. and the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> and to the 1955 Formosa Resolution giving the President
                            of the United States the authority to use U.S. armed forces to defend
                            the off-shore islands, if he judges such action is required or
                            appropriate in assuring the defense of Taiwan and the Pescadores. The
                            Chinese Communists might be advised that in view of the strength of the
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> garrisons on the off-shore
                            islands, any effort to take them would be a major operation which could
                            not easily be limited to the immediate vicinity of the islands. Serious
                            risk of wider hostilities involving U.S. forces would therefore
                            arise.</p>
                        <p>If the Chinese Communists were to raise with the British the report of
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> plans to attack the China
                            mainland, the British might respond by stating that it is their
                            understanding that the United States Government has no intention of
                            supporting such an attack under existing circumstances. The British
                            might also call attention to the Exchange of Notes between the U.S. and
                            the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> in December 1954 which requires
                            the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> to obtain agreement of the U.S.
                            in any offensive action by <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> military
                            forces. In this connection, they might also note that in our meetings
                            with the Chinese Communists since 1955, we have consistently been urging
                            agreement that force not be used by either side to change the existing
                            situation, and of course we continue to adhere to that position.</p>
                        <p>Consultation with Allies</p>
                        <p>In addition to consultation with the British I think we should move
                            immediately to inform the Australians and New Zealanders of our concern
                            over the Fukien build-up. As soon as the situation becomes clear we
                            should consult on a similar basis with the Japanese Government.</p>
                        <p>Congressional Consultation</p>
                        <p>Presumably you will wish to advise the leadership of the possible
                            implications of ChiCom actions. I shall await your instructions as to
                            any approaches you may wish us to make with other members of
                            Congress.</p>

                                Intentions</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>We have considered the effects of alternative US decisions to defend or
                            not to defend the offshore islands in the event of eventual communist
                            attack. We assume the decision is made in the near future and under
                            present circumstances (i.e., there is an ominous Communist Chinese
                            buildup but no offensive action against the offshore islands) and a
                            decision of such magnitude would become known to Peiping and Taipei
                            whether or not the US so intended. Our last assumption is that Peiping's
                            intentions are offensive and at the very least involve a phased, probing
                            approach to possible ultimate attack.</p>
                        <p>Our conclusion is that there are clearcut disadvantages in making any
                            firm decisions on US defense of the offshore islands under present
                            circumstances.</p>
                        <p>—A decision not to defend risks encouraging Chinese Communist efforts to
                            seize the islands, a lessening of possible Soviet influence for
                            restraint, and grave worsening of US-<gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            relations.</p>
                        <p>—A decision to defend risks increased <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            efforts to involve us even more deeply in their counter-attack actions
                            as well as a tightening of the Sino-Soviet alliance.</p>
                        <p>Continued ambiguity as to US intentions coupled with a military posture
                            capable of interpretation by the Chinese Communists as preparatory to
                            defense of the islands, while offering the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> no exploitable assurances, combines the advantages of
                            plausible deterrence and preparedness with maximum flexibility and
                            maneuverability for the US. It avoids a sharp worsening of US-<gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> relations and possibly serious domestic
                            US repercussions, while keeping the Chinese Communists seriously in
                            doubt as to the ultimate risks involved in a grab for the offshore
                            islands.</p>
                        <p>The primary justification for a decision to be made at this time not to
                            defend the offshore islands would be a policy decision to bring about
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> withdrawal from the islands.</p>
                        <p>Correspondingly the primary justification for a decision to be made at
                            this time to defend the offshore islands would be a policy decision to
                            give full support to the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>.</p>

                        <p>It is generally agreed that the Chinese Communist military buildup
                            opposite Taiwan and the offshore could be, from the military point of
                            view, compatible with Chinese intentions to:</p>
                        <p>1. Defend against a possible <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> attack
                            on the mainland (with or without US support),</p>
                        <p>2. Initiate a political-military crisis on the order of that of the 1958
                            shelling of Kinmen (Quemoy), or</p>
                        <p>3. Attack one or more of the offshore islands for the purpose of seizing
                            it by military means.</p>
                        <p>However aggressive Peiping's intentions may be, its actual course of
                            actions as the situation develops will be significantly affected by a
                            number of factors (other than purely military considerations) which
                            include the posture of the US, the attitude and actions of the GRC, and
                            the relationship between Peiping and Moscow. In our view, the most
                            important single factor in Peiping's eyes will be the posture and
                            apparent intentions of the US simply because the risk of direct
                            confrontation with US military power is the most critical single
                            limitation on Chinese Communist freedom of action in the situation.</p>
                        <p>If We Now Decide Not to Defend the Offshore Islands.</p>
                        <p>Convincing evidence that the US would not participate in the defense of
                            the offshore islands would sharply reduce the risks Peiping would see in
                            an attack on the islands. It would at the same time reduce the
                            likelihood that Moscow could exert any restraining influence on Peiping
                            since the latter would regard Soviet support as less likely to be
                            required.</p>
                        <p>In this situation, the Chinese Communists would be encouraged to launch
                            intensive propaganda and subsequently artillery barrages against one or
                            more of the islands in the expectation of reducing them to surrender
                            through blockade and attrition of troop morale without the necessity of
                            launching an amphibious assault. Such a probe would also constitute a
                            further test of the firmness of the US decision not to defend the
                            islands. If the US continued to show no evidence of supporting the
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> through logistic and other
                            assistance to maintain their island positions, and if Peiping became
                            convinced its probing tactics would not be successful, the Chinese
                            Communists might be emboldened to accept the lessened but still
                            formidable military costs of an amphibious assault. (Even if Peiping's
                            intentions are strictly defensive, evidence that the US would not defend
                            the islands could cause them to move over to the offensive.)</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would react to the US decision
                            with horrified disbelief. “The <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            attaches great political and psychological importance to the offshore
                            islands. Nationalist leaders are convinced that the islands must be held
                            not only to assist the defense of Taiwan, but more importantly to <pb n="262" xml:id="pg_262" facs="0298"/>maintain their claim to be a
                            national government, to prevent a serious blow to morale, and to
                            preclude any further decline in the prestige and international position
                            of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>.” [<gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> 43-61, June 20, 1961]<note n="1" xml:id="d125fn1">

                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would view the US decision as a
                            fundamental change in its China policy implying adoption of a
                            “two-China” position, as an unwarranted and cowardly retreat under
                            communist threat of force, and as an invitation to Peiping to apply
                            further force not only in the Taiwan Straits but also elsewhere in the
                            Far East.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would probably calculate that the
                            decision was not immutable. It would mobilize all its political
                            resources to attack the decision not only on the grounds cited above but
                            also as vitiating the impact of the 1958 Joint Resolution of Congress as
                            a deterrent to communist attack on the offshores and on Taiwan itself.
                            The <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would reassert its determination
                            to defend the offshores to the last man, whatever the consequences, and
                            might take actions designed further to prove its determination, e.g.,
                            reinforcements of the offshores and further military mobilization on
                            Taiwan. It would put the offshores themselves on intensified alert and
                            might respond sharply to Chinese Communist shelling (for example, by
                            returning <gloss target="#t_HE1">HE</gloss> for propaganda). It would
                            probably welcome an escalation of military activity at the offshores but
                            would be cautious about altering the levels or terms of conflict in ways
                            that the US might regard as dangerously provocative.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would probably anticipate that
                            the US would seek to persuade it to withdraw from the offshore islands
                            without bloodshed, and its position (as above) would be intended in part
                            to forestall any such attempt. If the US nevertheless did seek to
                            persuade the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> to withdraw, “… the
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would refuse, banking on US
                            reluctance to use its leverage. We believe that the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> leaders would eventually yield, but
                            only when they were convinced that the US would in fact use whatever
                            means were necessary to force compliance—e.g., drastic curtailment of
                            economic, military and diplomatic support.” [<gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> 43-61]</p>
                        <p>If the Chinese Communists eventually launched an attack on the offshore
                            islands, the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would desperately
                            attempt to reverse the US decision and agree to evacuate the islands
                            only if utter defeat were imminent.</p>
                        <p>If We decide Now to Defend the Offshore Islands</p>
                        <p> US commitment to defend the offshore islands would, at the very least,
                            diminish any doubts Peiping may have that an attack on the islands could
                            result in a direct clash with the US. The Chinese Communists would in
                            consequence become very cautious in their approach. At the <pb n="263" xml:id="pg_263" facs="0299"/>same time, however, Peiping's concern
                            over the likelihood of a GRC-US attack on the Chinese mainland would
                            almost certainly be aggravated by the sudden hardening of a position the
                            US had previously maintained ambiguously. This concern would be
                            communicated to and probably shared to an increased extent by the Soviet
                            Union, even should we attempt to relieve Soviet anxieties about our
                            offensive intentions against Communist China. Aside from the anticipated
                            propaganda exploitation by the bloc of anxieties among US allies and
                            others about the extended US commitment, there might well be at least a
                            temporary tightening of the Sino-Soviet military alliance. This could
                            carry with it attendant risks of escalation in the event of any <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> or Chinese Communist moves to take
                            advantage of the apparently increased support from their allies.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would welcome the knowledge that
                            the US had decided to help defend the offshore islands as further
                            commitment to the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> cause and as
                            offering new hope that it might involve the US in offensive actions
                            against the mainland.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would attempt to place greater
                            reliance on US military and logistic capabilities for the defense of the
                            offshores and to devote more of its own resources to other operations.
                            Therefore the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> could be expected to
                            seek US assistance in launching airdrops or even amphibious strikes on
                            the mainland outside the area of Chinese Communist buildup. Knowledge of
                            Chinese Communist strength and readiness would make the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> cautious about any action without
                            definite US support, but the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> might
                            either provoke an incident with the Chinese Communists which would be
                            calculated to engage US forces, or might be less careful to avoid such
                            an incident in their patrols and probes along the coast.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> might seize on any appropriate
                            Chinese Communist military action, such as shelling the offshores with
                            high explosives, to argue that the activity was preliminary to an
                            assault and that the US should take preemptive measures such as air
                            strikes at military positions in the immediate area or even at
                            supporting airfields and communications lines. The <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would probably not contemplate
                            independent strikes against the mainland but would increase pressures on
                            the US to provide planes and equipment for later airdrops or amphibious
                                landings.<note n="2" xml:id="d125fn2">

                                in a memorandum of June 26 to <persName corresp="#p_MGGC1">McGhee</persName>: “Incidentally, I find it surprising that
                                Defense now feels there is not a policy of seeking the withdrawal of

                                thought this had been a consistent policy since 1955, even though it
                                may not have been formally reaffirmed by this administration.”

                            recommend that the paper, or at least those sections dealing with an

                            islands, be referred to the President in a manner that will permit the
                            JCS and the Department of Defense to present possibly differing

                                also think we could not expect to settle such a question by

                        <p>2. The Joint Chiefs of Staff consider that the draft Guidelines of US
                            Policy Toward the Republic of China are in general consonance with US
                            strategic objectives for the Far East except for the paragraphs dealing
                            with the Government of the Republic of China (<gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>) Offshore Islands. With respect to the Offshore
                            Islands, the subject paper does not show a proper appreciation of the
                            strategic and military importance of this Island complex to the defense
                            of Taiwan/Penghus and to the attainment of US forward strategic
                            objectives in the Pacific.</p>
                        <p>3. The Offshore Islands are closely bound to the defense of
                            Taiwan/Penghus, which form an important link in the defensive chain
                            extending from the Aleutians to Australia. It is of the greatest
                            importance that our policy guidelines recognize this as US policy
                            regarding the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>. The Offshore Islands
                            themselves have significant military assets. They block the two most
                            important ports between Shanghai and Canton from which the ChiComs could
                            mount an amphibious attack against Taiwan/Penghus. They provide a source
                            of early warning for the air defense of Taiwan/Penghus, and they serve
                            as excellent visual reconnaissance and psychological warfare bases. The
                            withdrawal from a valuable strategic location that enhances our own
                            forward strategy and reduces ChiCom ability to mount an invasion force
                            is militarily unsound. Further, the Offshore Islands are of paramount
                            importance, politically and psychologically, in the minds of Asians as a
                            symbol of successful resistance against communist aggression. Moreover,
                            in event of war involving the United States and China, the Offshore
                            Islands could be a valuable asset in military operations against the
                            South China mainland. Retention of these islands together with the
                            maintenance of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> position on
                            Taiwan/Penghus will continue to pose a serious obstacle to the
                            attainment of the communist objective of occupying all Nationalist held
                            territory.</p>
                        <p>4. The major islands of the Offshore Islands complex are defensible
                            provided the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> is given adequate US
                            support. Without US support, the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            would not be able to defend the Offshore Islands for any prolonged
                            period against a determined ChiCom attack. The Offshore Islands are of
                            significant strategic, military, political and psychological importance
                            to the United States. A <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> defeat here
                            would damage greatly the US prestige and would lessen the credibility of
                            the US determination to stand firm against communist encroachment
                            elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>5. The Joint Chiefs of Staff recommend that the subject paper enunciate a
                            firm policy with regard to support of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> in the retention of the Offshore Islands as an integral
                            part of our forward strategy in the Pacific.</p>
                        <p>6. In view of the importance of this guideline to US forward strategy in
                            the Pacific, the Joint Chiefs of Staff recommend that this paper, <pb n="267" xml:id="pg_267" facs="0303"/>modified as indicated in the

                            news and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would be
                            gratified. I pointed out, however, that there were a <pb n="268" xml:id="pg_268" facs="0304"/>number of other steps which we would
                            have to watch carefully, such as the withdrawal of North Viet-Nam troops
                            and the integration of military force within Laos. I suggested that this
                            would mean continuation of close cooperation between us. He said that he
                            agreed and would be ready to discuss any matters that might arise. He
                            said that Pushkin<note n="5" xml:id="d127fn5">Georgi M. Pushkin, Soviet
                                Deputy Foreign Minister for Southeast Asia and Deputy Chief of the

                            worked together closely and the relationship established by our
                            governments should continue in the future. I said I hoped that Mr.
                            Pushkin would not create any difficulties in Geneva. He asked whether
                            there was much left for agreement. I replied that the declaration of the
                            Laotian Government was important as the international agreement and
                            protocol were based on it. He again commented that we should have
                            continued cooperation to achieve our mutual objectives. He said that he
                            considered that the fulfillment of the agreement between Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> and President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> on Laos was most important and
                            he hoped this would lead to understanding in other fields.</p>
                        <p>I then turned to mainland China. I said we had assumed Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> was interested in other
                            areas of the Far East, not simply Laos. We were surprised by the
                            build-up of Chinese Communist forces in Fukien and asked him what he
                            knew about it. He said that he had no information other than what he had
                            seen in the press. I said that such information as we had was generally
                            in line with the press reports and that we had no knowledge of the
                            ChiCom intentions. I asked him whether he thought the move was
                            precautionary against possible attack by <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> or a build-up for an attack on the
                            off-shore islands. Again he replied that he had no information.</p>
                        <p>I said I assumed Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                            did not want to see a major military engagement break out in the Pacific
                            and, therefore, we considered it important that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> should know the U.S.
                            Government's attitude. Since there had been a good deal of talk from
                            Taipei regarding <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName>'s
                            intention to invade the mainland, I thought Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> should understand that
                                <persName corresp="#p_KAAG1">Admiral Kirk</persName> was not being
                            sent as Ambassador because of his experience in amphibious warfare.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DA1">Dobrynin</persName> commented that he had
                            read of this speculation. I explained that <persName corresp="#p_KAAG1">Admiral Kirk</persName> had been selected because of his standing
                            and the confidence that President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> had in him; also, that we had no intentions
                            under existing circumstances of giving <persName>Chiang</persName>
                            encouragement or support for an attack on the mainland. It seemed
                            important for Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> to
                            understand this. I pointed out further that an agreement had been
                            reached between Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> and
                            President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> which
                            was still in effect, namely, that the ChiNats would take no offensive
                            action without full consultation and prior agreement on the part of the
                            United States. I also stated that in our meetings with the ChiComs since
                                <pb n="269" xml:id="pg_269" facs="0305"/>1955 we had consistently
                            been urging agreement that force not be used by either side to change
                            the existing situation and of course we continue to adhere to that
                            position. He said he felt sure Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would be glad to learn this. In reply to his
                            question, I told him that <persName corresp="#p_CJM1">Cabot</persName>
                            was seeing <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> in Warsaw
                                Saturday<note n="6" xml:id="d127fn6">June 23.</note> &amp; would
                            give him same information I was giving <persName corresp="#p_DA1">Dobrynin</persName>.<note n="7" xml:id="d127fn7">This sentence
                                appears in <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>'s

                        </p>
                        <p>I then continued that if for any reason the ChiCom build-up was of a more
                            ominous character, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                            should understand our treaty with the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> and I referred to the dangerous situation arising from
                            any aggressive action on the part of the ChiComs. With an air of
                            surprise, he commented “you wouldn't help defend the off-shore islands?”
                            I replied, “why not?” “But these islands are Chinese territory,” he
                            asserted. I said we believed in peaceful settlement of differences but
                            we could not stand by if the ChiComs took aggressive action.</p>
                        <p>He then raised the whole question of Formosa and asked whether we were
                            prepared to carry out the Cairo agreement.<note n="8" xml:id="d127fn8">Reference is to the Cairo Declaration, the communique issued by
                                President Roosevelt, Generalissimo <persName>Chiang</persName>, and

                            I pointed out that this was an agreement with <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName>, not with the ChiComs. When he attempted
                            to argue further, I asked whether Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> was prepared to hand over East Germany to
                            Adenauer. He asked if I could tell him anything about our policy toward
                            China. I replied that there was no change from the position President
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> had taken last
                                October.<note n="9" xml:id="d127fn9">The reference is unclear. For

                            possibility of change in that position, I said that this was not an
                            appropriate time for a discussion of the future of China and that we
                            should concentrate on the question before us, namely, why the ChiComs
                            were reinforcing their position in Fukien. He said that the Soviet
                            Government maintained Taiwan was part of China and would support that
                            position. I said I was familiar with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s attitude as he had told me in June,
                                1959.<note n="10" xml:id="d127fn10">

                            its sober, as well as some of its amusing aspects. Before leaving, he
                            reiterated the importance of Laos and said he hoped we would have
                            further discussions such as the one we had this afternoon. I replied
                            that I would not hesitate to talk with him about the developments and
                            agreed that it was of great importance that our two governments keep in
                            close contact. He left to dress for dinner with the Swiss
                            Ambassador.</p>

                        <p>U.S. wishes attention Peiping called to Mutual Defense Treaty between US
                            and <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> and to 1955 Formosa Resolution
                            giving President authority to use US armed forces to defend offshore
                            islands, if he judges such action is required or appropriate in assuring
                            defense of Taiwan and Pescadores. Peiping further advised that in view
                            of strength of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> garrisons on
                            offshore islands, any effort to take them would be a major operation
                            which could not easily be limited to immediate vicinity of islands.
                            Serious risk of wider hostilities involving US forces would therefore
                            arise.</p>

                            Peiping might also note that in our meetings with Chinese Communists
                            since 1955, we have consistently been urging agreement that force not be
                            used by either side to change the existing situation, and of course we
                            continue to adhere to that position.</p>

                        <head>129. Editorial Note</head>
                        <p>During the first few months of 1962, a series of draft statements
                            entitled “Basic National Security Policy” was prepared in the Policy
                            Planning Council under the supervision of its Director, <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt W. Rostow</persName>. None of the drafts was
                            approved. The final papers were a 185-page draft dated June 22, which
                            was sent to the President, and a shorter version dated August 2. The
                            June 22 paper called for a “carrot” and “stick” approach to Communist
                            China. It stated in part:</p>
                        <p>“We will use force to deter or deal with the Chinese Communists' military
                            or indirect aggression wherever it occurs; we will not otherwise
                            ourselves initiate aggression against Communist China; but we may not be
                            content to meet Chinese Communist harassments of the free community, if
                            these harassments expand, wholly within the borders of that
                            community.”</p>
                        <p>It also stated:</p>
                        <p>“Concurrently, we should leave ajar possibilities for expanding
                            commercial, cultural and other contacts with Communist China, by making
                            clear that the bar to the entrance of Communist China into more normal
                            relations with the U.S. is its basic unwillingness to modify its present
                            aggressive policies.”</p>
                        <p>Concerning Taiwan, it stated in part:</p>
                        <p>“a. We should use our influence and aid to promote the emergence on
                            Taiwan of a political process increasingly based on popular consent, and
                            to support economic development on an effective long-term basis.</p>
                        <p>“b. We should work, within the limits which a useful relationship with
                            the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> will allow, for a dampening-down
                            of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>-Chinese Communist civil war.
                            It remains an objective of U.S. policy: (i) to disengage U.S. and <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> prestige from the defense of the
                            offshore islands, if and when this can be done without damage to our
                            position in the Far East; (ii) to persuade the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> through means which include aid and support for its
                            position on Taiwan either to withdraw its forces from the islands or to
                            regard the islands as outposts to be garrisoned in accordance with the
                            requirements of outpost positions, again if and when this can be done
                            without damage to our position in the Far East.”</p>
                        <p>Concerning the Sino-Soviet split, it stated that while there was little
                            the United States could do to promote it, the United States should “at
                            least avoid measures which might have the effect of healing it.” It
                            further stated that the United States should not lose sight of the fact
                            that both states, whether closely knit or not, would continue to be
                            “basically hostile to us though perhaps in different degrees and in
                            different ways.” (Department of State, S/P Files: Lot 69 D 121, BNSP

                        <p>1525. On basis of limited info as to latest movement ChiCom forces to
                            Fukien Province, ConGen sees this build-up as being essentially
                            defensive in character reflecting ChiCom fears of ChiNat attacks on
                            mainland, increased concern over reliability of populace and possibly
                            apprehension over US intentions toward China as result recent US
                            military moves in SE Asia.</p>
                        <p>In moving force into Fukien Province, ChiComs probably seek to (A) deter
                            attack on mainland by <persName>Chiang</persName>'s forces or cope with
                            attack should it materialize; (B) provoke US and others to dissuade
                                <persName>Chiang</persName> from attack; (C) shore up internal
                            security situation particularly along coastal areas most directly
                            exposed to possible ChiNat activity; and (D) divert national attention
                            away from internal malaise and toward a common adversary. Peiping may
                            have in mind provoking <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> into
                            disavowing any involvement in threatened <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> military attacks against mainland, thereby smothering
                            possible expectations in China that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                            prepared to support return of <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>. (Note
                            relationship to how ChiComs used British closure of Hong Kong to
                            mainland refugee influx in dissuading people from further efforts go to
                            Hong Kong.)</p>
                        <p>If there is any new concentration of ChiCom forces now pointing toward
                            offshore islands, this is probably aimed at (A) throwing
                                <persName>Chiang</persName>'s return-to-mainland preparations off
                            balance; (B) calling world attention to possible conflict over these
                            controversial islands; and (C) causing USG to disclaim support for
                            offshores defense and otherwise seeking to weaken US-<gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> relations and undermine <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>In making moves to date, ChiComs probably have not yet determined whether
                            or not they would carry actions to point of actually attacking offshore
                            islands. May be moving into posture where that alternative open to them.
                            We continue to believe, as we have since 1958 offshore crisis, that
                            Peiping sees the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> occupation of these
                            islands as providing certain clear benefits, namely, avoid
                            crystallization “two China” concept; but in light of present mood as

                                <pb n="274" xml:id="pg_274" facs="0310"/>Asia. He expressed concern
                            about our military build-up in South Vietnam and forces in Thailand. He
                            mentioned that the three Princes agreement in Laos offered favorable
                            conditions for peaceful settlement in Laos and easing Southeast Asia
                            situation.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> then said his government
                            wished to call attention to situation in Taiwan area. <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> clique was preparing
                            invasion Chinese Mainland and this preparation had support US
                            Government. He then discussed at some length military preparations on
                            Taiwan including increase US military and economic aid. He said US
                            playing with fire, such attack would not benefit US and US would bear
                            responsibility for it.</p>
                        <p>Replying I expressed pleasure at Laos settlement and consequent reduction
                            of tension. With reference to troops in Thailand, we had always made
                            clear this a temporary measure. With reference to Vietnam, we were
                            giving military help to legitimate government in view of outside
                            intervention in South Vietnam. I then referred to situation in Taiwan
                            area. I said that I was authorized to state that US Government had no
                            intention of supporting any <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> attack
                            on Mainland under existing circumstances. I pointed out <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> committed not to attack without our
                            consent. I then noted ChiCom military build-up opposite Taiwan and said
                            if this defensive, it was unobjectionable. However, I invited his side's
                            attention to our formal treaty with <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            and to 1955 resolution re defense of Taiwan and Pescadores. I said that
                            any effort to take off-shore islands would require major military
                            operation which could not be easily limited and in such event there was
                            serious danger US forces would become involved. <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> requested me to repeat my last
                            statement which made in close paraphrase of Department's telegram. I
                            then referred to our repeated proposals for agreement renouncing use of
                            force by other side to which we continued to adhere. I summarized by
                            saying we had no intention of committing or supporting aggression
                            against his side anywhere.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> then repeated charge that
                                <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> planning
                            attack. He referred to <persName>Chiang</persName>'s repeated boasts
                            that he would return to Mainland and to military aid we had furnished
                            Chinese Nationalists over the years. He said that without US support,
                                <persName>Chiang</persName> would not dare to attack. <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> emphasized ChiCom military
                            strength and denied ChiComs were interfering in South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Replying I said I could not speak for <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            but reiterated we had no intentions of supporting attack on Mainland
                            under existing circumstances. If <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            forces invaded Mainland it would be contrary to their commitments to us
                            and I said I did not believe they would do it. I said with regard to
                            South Vietnam that I had merely stated that there had been foreign
                            intervention there, which had been certified by <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>. If <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> side
                            would discourage such intervention we would not have to send military
                            aid to legitimate government of South Vietnam.</p>
                        <pb n="275" xml:id="pg_275" facs="0311"/>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> referred to ChiCom
                            proposals for renunciation of force. He reiterated that without US
                            support, <persName>Chiang</persName> would not dare to attack. Replying
                            I pointed out that tension we were discussing existed precisely in
                            Taiwan Straits area and that our proposals for renunciation of force
                            specifically included that area whereas theirs did not. <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> stated ChiCom opposed to Two
                            China concept. Reverting to an earlier remark by <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> that our talks could not continue
                            if an attack were made, I said that such attack if made by <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would be without support of US. It
                            would seem to me most important under those circumstances for our talks
                            to continue in order to restore peace. We would clearly disassociate
                            ourselves from any such attack.<note n="4" xml:id="d131fn4">According to
                                    <persName corresp="#p_CJM1">Cabot</persName>'s report of the
                                meeting in airgram A-718, <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> said that if an attack occurred, the United
                                States “would certainly be held responsible for it” and the issue
                                would be one involving China and the United States.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> said that a simple
                            statement of disassociation would not suffice. I pointed out that I was
                            sure we would disassociate ourselves in word and deed from any attack
                            and would seek to restore peace. I then asked for assurances from him
                            that ChiComs would not attack Taiwan. There was a long pause and
                                <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> then replied question
                            of ChiCom attack does not arise. The question is of Taiwan organizing an
                            attack on Mainland. I regretted that it was not possible to have
                            reciprocal assurances. He replied “we have not faced the problem on our
                            side by seeking a settlement by force, but should an invasion take
                            place, the character of whole situation would change.” I then reminded
                                <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> again of our
                            commitments to <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Comment: Although discussion throughout was serious, atmosphere not
                            particularly tense. I think this summary of conversation, which comes
                            from almost word for word transcript made by Embassy officer, gives
                            flavor better than anything I can add. <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> was relaxed and friendly when offering us tea after
                            formal exchange. <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName>'s first
                            statement was made from prepared text but later ones were
                            extemporaneous. I was unable to reach any conviction as to whether his
                            demarche was made because of genuine anxiety on ChiCom part that <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> might invade Chinese Mainland with US
                            support or whether statement was attempt to pin responsibility on us in
                            planned ChiCom aggression against <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>.</p>

                        <p>(June 18-28, 1962)</p>
                        <p>The Secretary opened the conversation on China by referring to the ChiCom
                            military build-up opposite Taiwan. We felt that this was probably of a
                            defensive nature, responsive to the talk from Taiwan on “return to the
                            mainland.” He could assure the British, however, that Peiping knows that
                            the United States will not allow an attack on the mainland. He then
                            commented on the question of food for mainland China. He felt that an
                            initiative on our part in this connection would play into Peiping's
                            hands. Our people had calculated that to provide simply an additional
                            100 calories a day to bring consumption from 1300 to 1400 calories (as
                            against a normal requirement of 2200-2300) would alone cost in the range
                            of $700 million per year. This was a difficult question and one on which
                            the United States could not act unless it were possible to reverse the
                            Food for Peace slogan to “Peace for Food.”</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister replied vehemently that he simply did not understand
                            United States policy on China. We did not even admit that China existed.
                            He wondered what our long-run policy was. He regarded it as indefensible
                            by any logic. He said the Peiping regime obviously are China. The United
                            States had “a fellow from Taiwan” sitting in China's seat in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. He admitted that we had come out of the
                            last session very well, but only because we had “bullied all the South
                            Americans” into voting for us. The British, he said, do a good business
                            with the Chinese Communists. They had, for example, sold them fourteen
                            Viscounts. The British are an island, they live on trade.</p>
                        <pb n="277" xml:id="pg_277" facs="0313"/>
                        <p>The Secretary commented that the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> traded
                            with the Chinese Communists while we furnish the gendarmes to keep them
                            from misbehaving. If the choice had to be made, he would say frankly we
                            were much closer to the East Germans than to the Chinese Communists. He
                            commented that we would be faced with an appalling prospect if the
                            Chinese government changed and the food problem became ours. He added
                            that we are maintaining regular contact with the Chinese Communists
                            through the Warsaw talks but that we had got nothing from these, not
                            even a few American prisoners.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HLAFD1">Lord Home</persName> then referred to the
                            question of American troops in Southeast Asia and asked what should be
                            done about these. The Secretary replied that these were like <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> troops. They posed no threat for the
                            Chinese Communists if Peiping behaved. Our troops had no intention of
                            going north. <persName corresp="#p_HLAFD1">Lord Home</persName> then
                            asked whether if the situation remained quiet in South Vietnam it might
                            be possible to work out an arrangement along the lines of the Laos
                            settlement. The Secretary replied that the two situations were not
                            comparable. He then commented that there could be two interpretations of
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s purpose in Laos.
                            Possibly it could be that he wanted to show us that agreement was
                            possible. On the other hand, he may have wanted to show the other
                            Communist parties that his “peaceful coexistence” policy was a way to
                            advance the Communist cause. He felt that the situation still had to be
                            carefully watched. We were worried about the possible course of
                            development, especially during Souvanna's absence from the country.</p>

                        <p>June 18-28, 1962</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that last night they had talked about letting Peiping
                            know that there would be no attack. He said the Peiping regime had
                            broadcast an article which described these measures as defensive. In
                            addition, from their information, the scale does not indicate offensive
                            action, which was confirmed by the air dispositions and the fact that
                            there were no assault boats being assembled.</p>
                        <p>Turning to the question of food,<note n="2" xml:id="d133fn2">
                                <persName corresp="#p_HLAFD1">Lord Home</persName> raised the
                                question of sending food to China in a May 20 message to <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, who replied noncommittally in
                                a May 22 letter to British Ambassador David Ormsby Gore. (Both in
                                Department of State, Central Files, 893.49/5-2262) A British
                                aide-memoire of May 29 conveyed a suggestion by former Japanese
                                Prime Minister Yoshida for an international consortium to provide
                                food to China. (Ibid., 893.49/5-2962) On June 12 <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> authorized discussion of the

                                staff of the Peace Corps, that U.S. policy was “to do nothing on the
                                food until there is some indication that the Chinese Communists
                                desire it” and to “consider it on an independent basis at that
                                time.” (Public Papers of the Presidents of the United States:
                                    <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">John F. Kennedy</persName>, 1962,
                                pp. 487-488)</note> We did not see how food from outside could have
                            much effect on the general situation in China but he said, however, we
                            did not exclude the possibility of participating <pb n="279" xml:id="pg_279" facs="0315"/>in some general humanitarian action. He
                            felt that it would be essential politically in the United States to have
                            some indication from the Chinese communists that they were relaxing
                            their tactics of pressure on India and elsewhere in order to get it
                            through the Senate.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HLAFD1">Lord Home</persName> remarked that their
                            recent Charge in Peiping had said that nothing would induce the Chinese
                            to ask for aid. He said he felt there was nothing to do in the
                            circumstances but be ready to consult together if any request was
                            received. He mentioned that <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Averell
                                Harriman</persName> had suggested that the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> should talk to the Chinese about the off-shore islands
                            but that they were not in very good odor in Peiping at the moment. He
                            wondered if it would be worthwhile. He said they would be prepared to do
                            so if necessary, but doubted the desirability of doing it now. He said
                            the new Charge would be going to Peiping in the latter part of July. The
                            Secretary suggested that he might be briefed to be ready to act if and
                            when it was necessary and the British agreed.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary mentioned, in this connection, that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CJM1">Cabot</persName> in Poland, discussed this matter
                            with the Chinese Ambassador. In fact, <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> had brought it up. He said it was our impression
                            that the Chinese communist leadership was less arrogant and less
                            confident than previously.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName> mentioned certain
                            intelligence indications that we had had of a certain dampening-down of
                            the Chinese-Soviet dispute in recent months.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HLAFD1">Lord Home</persName> said that the Chinese
                            refugees trying to get into Hong Kong had been very interesting and
                            appeared to reveal that the provincial authorities were not in complete
                            control, but that when the national government had taken over the matter
                            the action was very quick. The Secretary said that we felt that the
                            unrest in China might have been a factor in the military buildup off
                            Taiwan. <persName corresp="#p_HLAFD1">Lord Home</persName> remarked that
                            they had that information; that there had been no censorship of letters
                            coming from overseas from Chinese who had written urging their relatives
                            to come out.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CSH1">Sir Harold Caccia</persName> said that on
                            his trip through China he had found them less arrogant but no less
                            sensitive. The Secretary remarked that the Chinese nationalists had
                            withdrawn their plan to put in a new SC representative,<note n="4" xml:id="d133fn4">Documentation concerning <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> interest in naming a new Security Council

                            very poor time to bring this up. He mentioned that ten years ago, to
                            Wellington Koo, that the Chinese could not get seven votes in the
                            Security Council, which had caused them to drop the matter then.</p>

                        <p>Turning to the question of the General Assembly this fall, the Secretary
                            mentioned that our people in New York felt that it would follow very
                            much the lines of last year. They had found little enthusiasm for the
                            study commission, but thought it was well to keep it alive for possible
                            use in the future.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Godber said that he thought this time it would be less procedural
                            than last year and would concentrate more on the central question—that
                            is, who would represent China. He felt that the study group might be a
                            means of stiffening the interest in this question.</p>

                                subject of the threat to the offshore islands and wanted answers by

                            Time did not permit the development of a complete answer to question 1.
                            b.: “What would be the likely pattern of the attack and what the
                            outcome?” We will continue to explore this subject.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> has concurred
                            in the Joint Staff's statements. I, too, share their views, with one
                            exception. The answer to question 5. b.<note n="3" xml:id="d134fn3">Question 5 asks about circumstances in which atomic weapons might
                                be used.</note> implies that the defense of the Offshore Islands may
                            require the use of tactical nuclear weapons, and that the U.S. should be
                            prepared to use such weapons. I believe that with full U.S. support the
                            Islands can be effectively defended without tactical nuclear weapons; in
                            any event, I am not ready to recommend their use for that purpose.</p>

                        <p><gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> MEETING HELD ON TUESDAY, JUNE 26,
                            1962 AT 10:30 AM.</p>
                        <p>Meeting was a formal <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> meeting called
                            for the purpose of hearing a report from Governor <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Adlai Stevenson</persName> on the problems
                            confronting the US delegation to the United Nations during the fall
                            meeting of the General Assembly. Governor <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> made the following points:</p>
                        <p>[Here follows paragraphs 1-5, <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName>'s review of various subjects.]</p>
                        <p>6. In answer to a question by the President the Ambassador stated that if
                            the Chinese Communists continue their strident attitude, their quarrels
                            with India, etc., the Chinese representation problem would be less of an
                            issue than in recent years. However, if <persName>Chiang</persName>'s
                            provocative statements concerning returning to the Mainland are
                            repeated, they will cause problems and embarrassments to the US in the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> expressed doubt as to the reason for the
                            military buildup, indicating he thought it might be due to domestic
                            implications.</p>
                        <p>He stated that the Soviet resolution<note n="1" xml:id="d135fn1">The
                                Soviet draft resolution introduced October 27, 1961, would have
                                immediately removed “the representatives of the <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> clique who are
                                unlawfully occupying the place of China in the United Nations” and
                                invited the Government of the People's Republic of China to send
                                representatives. (U.N. doc. A/L.360; printed in <hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy: Current Documents, 1961,</hi> p.
                                144)</note> if presented as in the past would be soundly defeated,
                            but that if they changed the resolution (which he thought was unlikely)
                            to merely recognition of ChiComs and not the expulsion of the ChiNats,
                            they might succeed in getting sufficient support to pass the
                            resolution.</p>
                        <p>7. In answer to another question by the President with respect to
                            responding to an attack on Quemoy, <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> stated that he, like others, wished that
                                <persName>Chiang</persName> was out of the Islands and therefore the
                            problem removed. He implied but did not specifically advise, a
                            declaration by the President to the effect that we would not assist in
                            the defense of Quemoy. He suggested that the President state that the US
                            “had no intention of supporting <persName>Chiang</persName>'s adventures
                            on the Mainland.” <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> went
                            on to state that many delegations of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> felt that <persName>Chiang</persName> was in trouble
                            politically in Taiwan, and that leadership of the ChiNats was passing to
                            other and perhaps more extreme and militant hands.</p>

                                the Defense of the Offshore Islands</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>I have just read the memorandum of 25 June from the Secretary of Defense
                            and the Joint Staff replying to your questions bearing on the defense of
                            the Offshore Islands.<note n="1" xml:id="d136fn1">See <ref target="#d134">Document 134</ref> and <ref target="#d134fn1">footnotes 1 and 2</ref>
                                thereto.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>In their reply, the Joint Staff appear to consider a classic amphibious
                            operation mounted against the Offshore Islands as the principal threat
                            from the ChiComs. This thought underlies the estimate in paragraph 1 a
                            of one to four months as needed to mount a major attack. It also finds
                            expression in paragraph 1 b, where the anticipated pattern of attack
                            includes a considerable air and artillery preparation prior to any
                            attempt to land. The same thought is found in 1 c, where the possibility
                            of a surprise attack receives a low rating.</p>
                        <p>Personally, I am not at all sure that this kind of deliberately phased
                            attack is the most likely or the most dangerous to the defense of the
                            Offshore Islands. Because of the shallow depth of the water around
                            Chinmen, it will be impossible to get heavy weapons ashore during the
                            assault phase. The attack will inevitably depend on masses of lightly
                            armed infantrymen, supported by air and artillery from the mainland. The
                            pattern of the assault is likely to resemble that of the ChiComs in <pb n="283" xml:id="pg_283" facs="0319"/>1949 rather than any American
                            amphibious landings of World War II. The amphibious shipping will
                            probably consist largely of rafts, sampans and junks employed in large
                            numbers and with little order.</p>
                        <p>It seems likely that the ChiComs would make every effort to exploit
                            surprise in making their attack. Under the cover of the very bad weather
                            which is common during this season of the year, and utilizing small
                            craft always in the area, it is entirely possible for the ChiComs to
                            make a quick jump across the narrow water passage separating Chinmen
                            from the mainland and establish a substantial beachhead in the course of
                            a single night. The Defense Intelligence Agency considers that the
                            landing craft required for an attack on the Chinmens or Matsu could be
                            marshalled within 24 or 48 hours, and that the ChiComs could launch an
                            attack on the Offshore Islands with little or no warning.</p>
                        <p>This or any other major attack will be extremely costly to the ChiComs
                            and, if they have sensible leadership, the adventure should not prove
                            attractive. However, we probably do not think like Chinese and their
                            eventual decision may run counter to what seems sensible to us. The
                            prize to them would be the elimination of a large part of
                                <persName>Chiang</persName>'s best troops, a serious blow to ChiNat
                            and U.S. prestige worldwide, and a great lift to the ChiCom home front.
                            On the other hand, a reverse for the ChiComs would greatly increase the
                            already serious internal situation and would exact a heavy price in
                            military assets.</p>

                        <p>On June 26 and 27, 1962, U.S. press and wire services carried reports
                            from “informed sources” about the June 23 meeting between Ambassadors
                                <persName corresp="#p_CJM1">Cabot</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName>. The evening of June 26 a
                            Department of State spokesman gave a statement to the press confirming
                            that <persName corresp="#p_CJM1">Cabot</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> had met on June 23, that
                                <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> had raised accusations,
                            and that <persName corresp="#p_CJM1">Cabot</persName> had “reiterated
                            our opposition to the use of force and our oft-repeated proposal for the
                            mutual renunciation of the use of force in the Taiwan Strait area.” The
                            statement was approved by <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>. (<persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>

                            summarized in telegram 786 to Taipei, June 27. (Department of State,
                            Central Files, 793.00/6-2762)</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> opened his press
                            conference on June 27 with a statement concerning the situation in the
                            Taiwan Strait area. He stated that there had been large movements of
                            Chinese Communist forces into that area and declared, “Our basic
                            position has always been that we are opposed to the use of force in this
                            area.” In the event of “aggressive action” against Quemoy and Matsu, he
                            declared, “the policy of this country will be that established 7 years
                            ago under the Formosa Resolution. The United States will take the action
                            necessary to assure the defense of Formosa and the Pescadores.”</p>
                        <p>After quoting a statement he had made in October 1960 supporting the
                                <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> administration
                            position, he continued as follows:</p>
                        <p>“Under this policy sustained continuously by the United States Government
                            since 1954, it is clear that any threat to the offshore islands must be
                            judged in relation to its wider meaning for the safety of Formosa and
                            the peace of the area.</p>
                        <p>“Exactly what action would be necessary in the event of any such act of
                            force would depend on the situation as it developed. But there must be
                            no doubt that our policy, specifically including our readiness to take
                            necessary action in the face of force, remains just what it has been on
                            this matter since 1955.” (<hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the

                            indicated that “somebody really high up is leaking because it was

                            made his statements at the Press Conference in the context of restating
                            United States policy and emphasizing the ‘defensive’ nature of our
                            treaty commitment. He said that he saw no useful purpose in changing
                            United States policy until such a time as we had some specific reason
                            for so doing, i.e., the possibility of deterioration on the Mainland to
                            a point where it was felt desirable to support
                                <persName>Chiang</persName> in a military operation. In other words,
                            he indicated that he was not pre-judging developments but simply wanted
                            to prevent the ChiComs from making propaganda capital out of any
                            apparent change in United States posture.” (Central Intelligence Agency,

                            avoid giving the appearance of contemplating any aggressive action
                            against the mainland at this time. Unless we both agree that conditions
                            justify it we are not prepared to take action and therefore we must not
                            appear aggressive. Invasion at this time obviously would not be
                            successful and it is important that the Communists be regarded as the

                            hands of the Communists by weakening our international position in the
                            defense of Quemoy and Matsu and make us appear to be the instigators of

                                    <persName>Chiang</persName> wanted to meet with him privately on
                                July 4 prior to <persName corresp="#p_KAAG1">Kirk</persName>'s
                                formal presentation of credentials the following day. (Ibid.,
                                611.93/7-362)</note> at which Madame <persName>Chiang</persName>,
                            Foreign Minister, Director GIO and Charge were present, <pb n="286" xml:id="pg_286" facs="0322"/>I said President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> had asked me to convey to
                            President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> how very
                            concerned President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> was
                            that no action be taken by <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> which
                            could be used as pretext by Communists to accuse us around the world of
                            being aggressors. I emphasized how important it was for aggressive
                            action to be clearly defined as coming from other side. I said this
                            would have important bearing on whatever we decided to do in future. I
                            added we were particularly concerned about Quemoy and Matsu and wanted
                            to make it clear to the world that we are not being aggressive in that
                            area. <persName>Chiang</persName> replied he fully appreciated US
                            position and assured me <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would not
                            initiate anything against Communists in Quemoy and Matsu area. However,
                            he thought Communists might take action against one of the smaller
                            offshore islands. ChiComs would wait and see how US reacted before
                            attacking anywhere beyond Quemoy and Matsu areas.</p>
                        <p><persName>Chiang</persName> then inquired whether I had any message for
                            him concerning the discussions of military material which had taken
                            place between our intelligence people. I replied President felt unable
                            to go very far in planning because of lack of hard intelligence on real
                            situation inside Communist China. However, I was authorized to assure
                            President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> two C-123s would
                            be ready in October and three more between January and February. The
                            other material requested was still under consideration.</p>
                        <p><persName>Chiang</persName> said he had read in press that US had
                            assured ChiComs at Warsaw that US would not assist <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> return to Mainland. Was this correct
                            and if so, what was nature of assurances given? I replied that this was
                            not correct, that what the US had proposed to ChiComs as in the past was
                            a mutual renunciation of force.</p>
                        <p><persName>Chiang</persName> asked if I had seen <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s statement that <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would support ChiComs in Taiwan
                                area.<note n="2" xml:id="d139fn2">Reference is to a July 2 speech by

                                from Moscow, July 2, reported that it had included “sharp

                            I replied I doubted very much <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                            would intervene in any operation in Taiwan Straits.
                                <persName>Chiang</persName> replied he also believed <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would not intervene. Unfortunately,
                            report of Warsaw talks together with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s statement couldn't help having adverse
                            effect on morale here. I said most westerners discounted <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s threats.
                                <persName>Chiang</persName> replied this was appreciated by people
                            at high level in government but not by people in general.</p>
                        <p><persName>Chiang</persName> emphasized need for US and <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> to be prepared for ChiCom offensive
                            action against offshore islands, which he expected within the next six
                            months. He then went on to express pleasure at my assignment <pb n="287" xml:id="pg_287" facs="0323"/>here and said that as soon as he had
                            recuperated from further medical treatment beginning July 5, he hoped to
                            consult closely with me. I said I was always at his disposition and
                            added that he could count on the US fully complying with its commitments
                            to <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> provided <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> did not undertake any unilateral action.
                                <persName>Chiang</persName> assured me <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would not undertake any unilateral action, but would
                            continue to consult very closely with US.</p>
                        <p>I concluded interview by explaining reasons why 1,000 Marines withdrawn
                            from Thailand. <persName>Chiang</persName> commented he thought this
                            would have adverse effect on morale of people in area, as Laos problem
                            was far from solved, but admitted that he was not fully abreast of
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>Interview was very friendly throughout. Points on which

                            assurances given by US at Warsaw and US response to his request for

                        <p>22. Following presentation credentials President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> had me come to his office for
                            conversation at which Foreign Minister, Secretary General Chang Chun and
                                <gloss target="#t_DCM1">DCM</gloss> were present. He said that since
                            he was going into hospital this afternoon and would not be available for
                            a few days he wanted to make some additional comments related to our
                            conversation of July 4.</p>
                        <p><persName>Chiang</persName> said he first wished President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> to understand he would not
                            undertake any unilateral action but would cooperate sincerely with the
                            US and fully coordinate his policy with us. He recognized <pb n="288" xml:id="pg_288" facs="0324"/>that President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> had many problems to deal with
                            and he certainly would not do anything which would add to these
                            problems. He hoped US Government would on its part also keep in mind
                            importance of maintaining morale of Chinese people and armed forces and
                            their confidence in <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_CJM1">Cabot</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> conversation and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> declaration had caused much uneasiness in
                            mind of people and Armed Forces. Press in Hong Kong and Taipei reflected
                            this apprehension. I replied <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> could hardly be expected to say anything
                            other than what he said. On basis our own sources of information we feel
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> does not want war
                            in Taiwan Straits and therefore are not too much concerned.</p>
                        <p><persName>Chiang</persName> said top <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            officials shared our view but propaganda effect on people was bad. I
                            suggested <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> make use of its press to
                            reassure its people. <persName>Chiang</persName> responded that they
                            lost no opportunity to assure people of US support but clarification
                            from Washington would carry greater weight. He expressed hope Ambassador
                            would strengthen work of [<hi rend="italic">1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>] and that plans for strengthening <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> Air Force and Navy being discussed by
                            this committee could be carried out. <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            would then be in position counter doubts in Armed Forces as to US
                            support by pointing to what US is doing.</p>
                        <p>I pointed out relations between our two governments are governed by 1954
                            treaty which guarantees defense of Taiwan and Pescadores and such
                            related territories as US President may find necessary to defense of
                            Taiwan and Pescadores. US maintains forces in this area and is fully
                            prepared to use them in support of its treaty obligations. Treaty does
                            not say we will support <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            counterattack against mainland and it would be mistake to create
                            impression in minds of people that US has any such obligations. If time
                            comes when two governments mutually decided conditions are suitable for
                            invasion that will create a new situation, but at present US commitment
                            is limited to support of defensive nature.</p>
                        <p><persName>Chiang</persName> replied both he and Chinese people fully
                            understand defensive nature of treaty relationship. However, he hoped
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KAAG1">Kirk</persName> could not only
                            help maintain but also strengthen morale of <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> Armed Forces. If morale dampened, this would be loss
                            both to US and <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>I remarked that I did not think either <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s statement or <persName corresp="#p_CJM1">Cabot</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> talk
                            should be taken so seriously as President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> appeared to regard them.
                                <persName>Chiang</persName> replied that news from US often produced
                            far greater effect than people in Washington imagine. At time when
                            ChiComs showing force he did not expect US publicly announce its support
                            for <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> counter-attack—that would
                            obviously be impossible—but neither did he see necessity of declaring to
                            enemy US would not help <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>. Foreign
                            Minister interjected that President was not so much complaining about
                            past actions as expressing hope care would be taken in future.</p>
                        <pb n="289" xml:id="pg_289" facs="0325"/>
                        <p><persName>Chiang</persName> concluded by saying he hoped he would not
                            need too long a rest, but that in meantime Vice President and Foreign
                            Minister were always available. Full memcon follows.<note n="1" xml:id="d140fn1">Enclosed with airgram A-18; see <ref target="#d139fn3">footnote 3, Document 139</ref>. In telegram 3

                        <p>The Estimate</p>
                        <p>1. At the time when <gloss target="#t_SNIE1">SNIE</gloss> 13-5-62 was
                            approved on 20 June, Chinese Communist armed forces had moved into the
                            Foochow Military</p>
                        <pb n="290" xml:id="pg_290" facs="0326"/>
                        <p>Region in large numbers. There had been no public announcement of the
                            move, and no propaganda manifestations by the Chinese Communists which
                            appeared to have any relationship to it. Neither were there any other
                            clear indications of the purposes and motivations which might lie behind
                            it. The Chinese Communists did have sufficient reason to take seriously
                            the possibility of incursions by <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            forces in the coming months, and they had of course not abandoned their
                            claims to Taiwan and the offshore islands.</p>
                        <p>2. Soon after 20 June news of the Chinese Communist military buildup
                            appeared in the Western press, accompanied by statements of concern
                            about Peiping's intentions. Chinese Communist propaganda then began
                            vigorously to attack the Chinese Nationalists and the US, accusing them
                            of a concerted intention to invade the mainland, but placing no stress
                            on the “liberation” of the offshore islands or Taiwan. No movements of
                            major military units into the Foochow Region were noted subsequent to 17
                            June. On 23 June Chinese Communist Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> sought out US Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_CJM1">Cabot</persName> in Warsaw, probably in
                            order to discover what he could of US intentions. He was told that the
                            US would not support a Chinese Nationalist attack on the mainland under
                            present circumstances, and was also warned of the risks involved in a
                            Chinese Communist attack on the offshore islands. US statements and
                            Press Conference remarks by the President reaffirmed earlier
                            declarations of US policy on the issues involved. Movements and
                            increased readiness of US forces accompanied these statements.</p>
                        <p>3. Although these developments have changed the situation considerably
                            they still do not permit a firm estimate of the motivations which lay
                            behind the military buildup. A plausible interpretation is that the
                            Chinese Communist leaders were seriously concerned with the possibility
                            of a <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> incursion, perhaps with US
                            support, on the mainland at a time of considerable unrest, and that they
                            accordingly moved enough forces into the area to deter such incursions,
                            to cope with them if they occurred, and to be in a position to attack
                            the offshore islands if such a course seemed desirable, possibly in
                            connection with repelling Nationalist landings on the mainland. They may
                            also have had various expectations of political profit to be made when
                            the troop movement became known, the reactions to it registered in the
                            world, and the US attitude tested. This interpretation of the Chinese
                            motives does not exclude the possibility that offensive action was under
                            consideration prior to the US reactions.</p>
                        <p>4. Whatever the original motivations of the Chinese Communist military
                            buildup may have been, world attention has been focused again on the
                            Taiwan Strait issue, and a declaration of attitude and policy has been
                            issued by the US. Publicly, the Chinese Communists proclaim their
                            disbelief in the US disclaimer of support for <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> intrusion on the mainland, and they probably do remain
                            somewhat uncertain of US intentions. <pb n="291" xml:id="pg_291" facs="0327"/>Yet the US statement probably diminished their fears of
                            such attacks. It must also have encouraged them to hope for serious
                            friction between the US and the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>.
                            Finally the Chinese Communists have used the situation to try to arouse
                            the mainland population from its lethargy and perhaps to reduce the
                            chances of local support for any possible Chinese Nationalist
                            landing.</p>
                        <p>5. The magnitude and scope of the military buildup have increased the
                            offensive as well as the defensive capabilities of the Chinese
                            Communists, and we still cannot dismiss the possibility of a full-scale
                            assault on the offshore islands. However, the element of surprise has
                            been largely lost, and the risks of the enterprise have been confirmed
                            by US policy statements and precautionary measures. For the near future,
                            therefore, we think that the odds are against such an attack. The
                            Chinese Communists might undertake raids or small-scale attacks on one
                            or another of the smaller islands held by the Nationalists, but there
                            would be danger of escalation even in such actions and we doubt they
                            would consider the gains worth the risk.</p>

                            propaganda, immediate all out Chinese Communist attack did not appear

                            if some effort might be made to clear air. Secretary replied that he

                                time.</note> which will clarify situation. <persName corresp="#p_TT1">Tsiang</persName> asked whether Secretary could
                            also make clarifying statement in press conference. Secretary replied
                            that if question arises in press conference he will of course be
                            responsive.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_TT1">Tsiang</persName> next referred to question
                            of <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> military action against China
                            mainland. He assured Secretary that <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            will not engage in any adventurist policy and that <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> will live up to its obligation to
                            consult US before any military move. At same time, <persName corresp="#p_TT1">Tsiang</persName> stated, <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> cannot sit idly by if worsening mainland economic
                            situation leads to large scale uprisings. <persName corresp="#p_TT1">Tsiang</persName> asked whether US could not adopt “more or less
                            flexible attitude” on this problem or at least not make public
                            statements which Chinese Communists can exploit to deprive mainland
                            people of hope.</p>
                        <p>4. Secretary responded that whether fundamental change in mainland
                            situation will occur cannot now be predicted. We have no information
                            indicating change in disparity between <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> and Chinese Communist forces or weakening in control of
                            Chinese Communist regime. Under present circumstances we cannot adopt
                            flexible position. We do not want to build up expectations in absence of
                            evidence that they can be fulfilled. Also <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> must be very careful not to mislead own people.</p>
                        <p>5. Secretary said great weakness is lack of firm accurate information on
                            mainland situation. <persName corresp="#p_TT1">Tsiang</persName> said if
                            US has such information President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> would certainly consider it carefully. <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> realizes its own intelligence is
                            spotty. Secretary said we would be glad to share such information but
                            collection difficulties are well known.</p>
                        <p>6. At conclusion of call <persName corresp="#p_TT1">Tsiang</persName>
                            repeated hope that US could adopt more flexible attitude or at minimum
                            not make unfavorable public statements. Secretary replied problem is
                            always not to be misleading or confusing. Our first obligation is to our
                            own people. Secretary added we will continue to watch situation and will
                            consider statements made by <persName corresp="#p_TT1">Tsiang</persName>. He did not want to give impression, however, that
                            there would be any major change in our publicly stated position. For
                            years we have declared that issues in Taiwan Strait must be resolved
                            without resort to force.</p>

                        <p>1) <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> opened saying favorable
                            developments Laos should have been starting point toward relaxation
                            tensions but US continuing aggravate tensions Southeast Asia and Taiwan
                            Straits. Said <persName corresp="#p_BCA1">Bowles</persName> and other
                            officials had announced US building up military crescent in western
                            Pacific encircling China. This was “insolent” scheme which Chinese
                            people deeply resented. Considered US troops Thailand threat security
                            Laos and neighboring states. Enumerated further alleged encroachments
                            air space and territorial waters by US resulting to date in 209 serious
                            warnings. <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> specifically said
                            we in error in claim De Haven had not entered Chinese Communist
                            territorial waters. Concluded saying long-standing Sino-American dispute
                            subject to settlement by US withdrawal from Taiwan.</p>
                        <p>2) I replied US gratified progress re Laos and pointed out we have
                            already withdrawn some forces from Thailand which we would not be likely
                            to do so if we had aggressive intent of which <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName>'s side accuses us. Said could not
                            understand why we were accused of increasing tensions after what I told
                                <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> under instructions in
                            recent private meeting. Said I regretted use of word “insolent” for our
                            endeavor to defend ourselves and friends against attack. Continued with
                            substance paragraph (1) reference telegram, adding observations re
                            import <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> findings and adding three
                            quotes from <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName>'s writings
                            glorifying military force to indicate Communist support military
                            activities Southeast Asia was in line with very policy of Chinese
                            Communist regime. Followed with statements re imprisoned Americans and
                            newsmen exchange accordance paragraphs (3) and (7) reference
                            telegram.</p>
                        <pb n="294" xml:id="pg_294" facs="0330"/>
                        <p>3) <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> then virtually repeated
                            his opening speech, adding comment re letter from prominent Americans
                            appearing <hi rend="italic">NY Times</hi> April 16 as evidence American
                            people not behind our Vietnam policies. Said Chinese people do not want
                            war with US so question renunciation force between us does not arise.
                            Said exchange newsmen was old question first raised by Chinese side. US
                            obstruction prevented agreement.</p>
                        <p>4) I said I had already answered <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName>'s repetitious observations but was pleased in
                            tribute he paid to freedom of expression in America. Said seemed to me
                            test of aggressive intent simply made; not only had <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName>'s side refused agree to mutual
                            renunciation force but while we had unilaterally informed his side we
                            would not support use of force in Taiwan Straits area under present
                            circumstances, <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> had refused
                            give reciprocal assurance his side would not use force. Would seem to be
                            clear which side thinking of using force and which side not. Refuted
                                <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> claim we had obstructed
                            newsmen exchange.</p>

                            when—if no, we are to remain “good friends”.</p>
                        <p>Possibly I am expressing this thought too crudely and furthermore it may
                            not be the desire of the Generalissimo to put the question to the test
                            at this time.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless it is evident that US position is thought to be equivocal
                            with unspoken misgivings over our attitude on the “two-Chinas” question
                            and latent concern over possibility of US support for third force on
                            mainland or elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>Our response that request for B-57's and landing craft “under
                            consideration” has been taken as indicating unwillingness to take
                            positive action. Nevertheless, I see no reason to let the issue be
                            forced upon us in immediate future. I think we can continue to delay
                            until all implications size and import this request for large amounts
                            war material obviously of an offensive character are fully digested. Its
                            aggressive nature is self-evident and its release to <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> cannot be concealed.</p>

                            been bad. These bad harvests have brought ChiCom Govt and people great
                            difficulties. While seven provinces seriously affected and large parts
                            population have rather too little to eat, nobody is starving because
                            China for first time in its history has a proper national organization
                            for the distribution of food in all areas of the country. The Chinese,
                            given time, will overcome these difficulties. Grain purchases from
                            Canada and Australia had helped. However only the Chinese themselves, by
                            improving their agriculture and growing much more food, could solve the
                            national problem.</p>

                            may be left free to get on with the vast tasks of improving the peoples'
                            standard of living and of national development. While some of their
                            critics think ChiComs wish to be aggressive in this or that neighboring
                            country, ChiComs do not entertain such desires. Since they must mobilize
                            all their resources for internal development, they do not want to get
                            involved in any wars, big or small. The Laos agreement is, therefore,
                            welcome to them. They hope that it will lead to an improvement elsewhere
                            in Southeast Asia, and they hope that foreign intervention in Laos can
                            be brought to an end, the civil war there stopped, and a truly neutral
                            government maintained by the three Laotian political forces. Peoples,
                            such as some of those of Africa and South America, who are striving for
                            independence have been promised help by the Chinese. Help, which the
                            Chinese are prepared to give, will be forthcoming in ways which will be
                            peaceful. All peoples who are not yet independent are being advised by
                            the Chinese to strive for the achievement of their goals through
                            peaceful means such as political or diplomatic negotiations.</p>
                        <pb n="297" xml:id="pg_297" facs="0333"/>
                        <p>Success of the Laotian conference, Chen said, demonstrated that patient
                            diplomatic negotiation can settle international questions. Signature of
                            the agreement by both Chinese and American representatives is a step
                            forward in relations between China and America.</p>
                        <p>Chen said that contrary to what many critics of China had asserted, the
                            massing of troops opposite Quemoy and Matsu was not intended to divert
                            the attention of the Chinese people from domestic difficulties or to
                            unnecessarily excite them about foreign threats. <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName>'s loud announcements of
                            his intentions of attacking the mainland caused the Chinese to feel it
                            necessary to dispose troops on the mainland opposite Taiwan. The number
                            of prominent American military figures visiting Taiwan recently has also
                            caused them concern.</p>
                        <p>Chen said that American assurances that neither support nor encouragement
                            would be given <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> to
                            attack the mainland had been conveyed to the Chinese Ambassador in
                            Warsaw by the American Ambassador. The Peking Government appreciated
                            this assurance. Though it was a good step forward, it was not, by
                            itself, enough. <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName>'s
                            dynasty had fallen long ago, and the Americans therefore should abandon
                            their support for him in Taiwan. The Chinese can never accept that
                            Taiwan is not a part of the rest of China.</p>
                        <p>The Chinese would not use force in an attempt to settle this question.
                            They will not attack Quemoy and Matsu, though they easily could do so,
                            nor will they take military action against Taiwan, though they could do
                            so. Ultimately, the Americans will have to realize that they should
                            abandon <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName>'s cause.
                            The Taiwan question has remained unsettled for thirteen years and it may
                            be necessary to wait another thirteen years, but the Chinese will be
                            patient.</p>
                        <p>Chen criticized some aspects of American policy but not so virulently as
                                <persName corresp="#p_MDDS1">MacDonald</persName> might have
                            anticipated. He said, in reply <persName corresp="#p_MDDS1">MacDonald</persName>'s comments that he realized that the
                            Administration could not ignore lobbies and other interests in Congress
                            and elsewhere which are hostile, and that Americans feel very strongly
                            about Communist China. But he said that here again the Chinese were
                            ready to be understanding and patient. <persName corresp="#p_MDDS1">MacDonald</persName> said that the present US administration on a
                            number of Asian questions such as that of Laos had modified the policies
                            of the previous administration. It understands and accepts the
                            neutrality of some other Asian countries as well. Chen asked whether
                                <persName corresp="#p_MDDS1">MacDonald</persName> thought the
                            President and <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> are
                            sincere in their Laotian policy and whether the other modifications
                                <persName corresp="#p_MDDS1">MacDonald</persName> mentioned are also
                            sincere. <persName corresp="#p_MDDS1">MacDonald</persName>'s reply was
                            emphatically affirmative, and Chen then said he was inclined to think
                            the same. <persName corresp="#p_MDDS1">MacDonald</persName> told him
                            that alterations in policy could only take effect gradually in a country
                            with a constitution like America. Chen said the American government's
                            policies <pb n="298" xml:id="pg_298" facs="0334"/>and difficulties
                            should be understood by the Chinese and that they should patiently hope
                            for a gradual improvement in relations.</p>
                        <p>Chen nodded sagely when <persName corresp="#p_MDDS1">MacDonald</persName>
                            observed that it was Chinese policy on some matters which had driven the
                            west in general and the Americans in particular to strong criticism, and
                            that the Chinese should do things which would impress the sincerity of
                            their peaceful intentions upon the Americans and the British.</p>
                        <p>Chen said he understood from the former ChiCom Charge in London that
                                <persName corresp="#p_HLAFD1">Lord Home</persName> would be glad to
                            meet Chen in Geneva, and Chen said he hoped there would be time for him
                            to have a talk with <persName corresp="#p_HLAFD1">Lord Home</persName>,
                            as he wanted to discuss ways of further improving relations between
                            China and Great Britain. He considered them quite good now, thought they
                            could be steadily improved, and believed that China and Britain can
                            bring about general improvement in the international atmosphere through
                            cooperative effort. Chen said he was in a hurry to get back to Peking to
                            help tackle urgent problems confronting the government and would be in
                            Geneva only until the 25th. <persName corresp="#p_MDDS1">MacDonald</persName> promised to report this to <persName corresp="#p_HLAFD1">Lord Home</persName>, who would have to leave
                            Geneva a day prior to Chen's own anticipated departure date.</p>

                        <p>DEAR MAX: You may have missed this Airgram from Hong Kong<note n="1" xml:id="d146fn1">Airgram A-60 from Hong Kong, July 18, entitled
                                “Implications for U.S. Policy of Latest Developments in Communist
                                China,” summarized reports of a deteriorating situation on the China
                                mainland and estimated that although there seemed to be no imminent
                                threat to the Communist Party's retention of power, the weakened
                                economy would “deter Peiping from large-scale overt military
                                adventures” but not from less ambitious efforts. It concluded that
                                the United States should continue to restrain the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> from attacking the mainland while
                                continuing its general posture of containing Chinese Communist
                                expansionism. (Department of State, Central Files, 793.00/7-1862)
                                See the Supplement.</note> which represents, I think, a line of
                            thought many of us share.</p>
                        <p>One implication of the situation in China which, I believe, should be
                            brought home to the President is this: whether Chinese development has
                            been retarded for “tens of years” (page 3), it is pretty clear that for
                            the <pb n="299" xml:id="pg_299" facs="0335"/>1960's Communist China is
                            not going to be a major industrial and military power. Over the
                            foreseeable future, we do not, therefore, face in Southeast Asia
                            historical pressure which should lead us to any fatalism about losing
                            that region. The Chinese situation should strengthen our will to pursue
                            a policy which would deny South Viet Nam, Thailand—and Laos, too—to the
                            Communists over the indefinite future; and we should pursue this policy
                            with inner confidence.</p>

                            the 200-man drop concept, which comes close to the first stage of active
                            military operations.</p>
                        <p>I visualize a situation where the 200 men have been dropped on a hillside
                            and are in the process of collecting a certain amount of support.
                            Meanwhile the People's Army of Liberation (or whatever they call
                            themselves) begin marching in regimental strength from its base some
                            distance away towards our 200 men. Several days go by and in the
                            meantime there have been a certain amount of defections, and our 200 men
                            are joined by say a thousand or so mainland Chinese.</p>
                        <p>At this point the regiment arrives and our 200 men augmented call the
                            Gimo, who calls us, for help. What do we do?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KAAG1">Admiral Kirk</persName> suggested that we
                            should try to find a time when we could go to the Gimo and be more frank
                            with him. We should point out, perhaps, that the President of the United
                            States cannot surrender his decision whether or not to commit his
                            country to major military action to any other person, no matter who may
                            be allied with us; and by the same token the President cannot put
                            another person in a position to force the United States into such an
                            action. (Vide <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>.)</p>
                        <p>Thus, we will do everything necessary for the defense of Taiwan. We will
                            help in doing everything possible to obtain intelligence information on
                            the situation on the Mainland, both for the benefit of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> and also to put ourselves in the
                            position to make an intelligent decision when the occasion arises. But
                            we must stop short of deliberately supplying an offensive capability
                            under circumstances which makes it possible for others to take the
                            ultimate decision away from us.</p>
                        <p>A possible time for having <persName corresp="#p_KAAG1">Admiral
                                Kirk</persName> go to the Gimo with such thoughts would be at the
                            end of the year when a decision to permit a 200-man drop has to be
                            taken.</p>
                        <p>The consequences of any frank talk with the Gimo would, I understand, be
                            fairly sharp in Taiwan and perhaps also in Congress if the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> decided to make a public noise about
                            it. But I think that such a noise is far <pb n="301" xml:id="pg_301" facs="0337"/>more endurable than the prospect of being caught in a
                            sequence of events over which we have less and less control.</p>

                                to determine whether overt military action would have any chance of

                        <p>1. In order to minimize possibility of adverse reaction by
                                <persName>Chiang</persName>, your response on landing ships and
                            bombers should not take form of final turn-down. You should clearly
                            state our unwillingness provide these items under present circumstances,
                            but at same time indicate willingness to reconsider negative decision
                            should changed circumstances warrant.</p>
                        <p>2. Only two C-123s should be brought to Taiwan in support of small drop
                            program. Bringing larger number to Taiwan might unduly stimulate <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> hopes of US concurrence in 200-man
                            drops which we oppose under present circumstances. Also, if as seems
                            possible ChiComs have knowledge of 200-man drop proposal, appearance of
                            several C-123s on Taiwan might increase tension in area.</p>

                        <p>4. Regarding your statements that it seems imperative test “as soon as
                            possible” whether mainland deterioration has proceeded point where small
                            clandestine teams could survive and that we should persuade <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> undertake small team drops, would offer
                            following comments: (A) from our viewpoint the need so to test situation
                            is not pressing in the time sense per se, but only in the context of
                            anticipating, containing and diverting <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> pressures for larger-scale operations; and (B) although
                            we do not object to 20-man team drop we would not want press any drops

                            undertake amphibious assault in support widespread uprising on mainland.
                            While such study may generate additional requests for US equipment we
                            recognize it may be essential bring home to President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> and his advisors realistic
                            appreciation problems involved in overt amphibious operations. Assume
                            your purpose is educational and that every effort will be made to avoid
                            any appearance of joint planning. However, we would oppose similar study
                            capabilities launch amphibious assault as diversionary measure in event

                            should not be encouraged think of such assault as acceptable response to
                            such attack. US effort in event of such attack would be to localize and
                            dampen down hostilities.</p>
                        <p>6. Regarding <persName>Chiang</persName>'s possible renewal threat
                            resign: You are probably aware he resigned, early in 1948, but did not
                            fully relinquish control. His recently reported statement he might
                            resign and head a revolutionary movement, if actually made, appears to
                            have posed implicit threat he might free himself from responsibility for
                            govt's international commitment without giving up ability to influence
                            relevant acts of govt. However, he could not, in good faith to us, thus
                            separate authority from responsibility. Against this background we
                            wonder whether reported statement was more than threat designed
                            influence us to support his programs for return to mainland.</p>

                            meeting that <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> had stated it would
                            rely principally on measures other than force to achieve objectives
                            whereas <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName>'s side unwilling so
                            state. <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> said China could not
                            “sign such an agreement”. Said my comment that if ChiComs could not
                            pledge themselves to such renunciation, we would remain ready carry out
                            our obligations to <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> contained implied
                            threat. No one would be cowed by threats. Taiwan being Chinese territory
                            this was strictly internal matter. Means Chinese would use re Taiwan was
                            no business of US. This was absolutely not a subject for discussion at
                            Ambassadorial level talks between two countries. Said while Taiwan was
                            internal matter, the international dispute which exists between China
                            and US, like other international disputes, should be settled without use
                            of threat of force. Fact is US has already used force in occupying
                            Taiwan. Therefore in dispute between China and US, US alone should
                            denounce use of force and withdraw Seventh Fleet. US refused consider
                            Chinese draft agreement September 22, 1958.<note n="3" xml:id="d149fn3">For text, see <ref target="frus1958-60v19">

                            area. Since US has already used force, how can Chinese agree to anything
                            which would <pb n="304" xml:id="pg_304" facs="0340"/>make US armed
                            occupation Taiwan perpetual and legalized? Said our treaty with
                                <persName>Chiang</persName> was worthless and US would be held
                            responsible for consequences its activities. Sooner or later we would be
                            thrown out of Taiwan if we refused quit now. Hoped US would not make
                            mistake of failing recognize determination Chinese people liberate
                            Taiwan.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> continued saying wished
                            speak of important matters. All evidence pointed to continuation
                            military activities of US in vicinity North China territorial waters.
                            From 0235 on 14 April to 0031 on 21 April destroyer De Haven intruded
                            into territorial waters from Chien-Li-Yen to Ping Island. From 0310 to
                            2008 on 22 May US destroyers encroached Northeast Tsingtao. From 0500 to
                            2335 on 12 June another US destroyer was in vicinity territorial sea
                            between Ping Island and Chao-Lien Island. On morning 9 July US destroyer
                            came close to Cheng-Shan-Tou and Tung-Lien Island in territorial waters.
                            On 17 August US destroyer operated in vicinity East of Jung-Cheng Bay,
                            east of Tsingtao. <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> said this
                            matter had gone too far to be tolerated. Under instructions was making
                            serious protest once more and US would be held responsible for all
                            consequences.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> expressed surprise that
                            after June 23 private meeting State Department had made disclosures of
                            subjects discussed after which there followed heavy press coverage. Said
                            he had never divulged anything to press.</p>
                        <p>5. I gave historical refutation <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName>'s claim American Government hostile to China,
                            adding US not threatening anyone and desired peace in all parts of the
                            world. Again denied we occupying Taiwan. US is judge of its treaty
                            commitments and considers treaty with <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> valid. Referred to <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName>'s repeated mention our ships being “vicinity of” or
                            “near” territorial waters. Pointed out this not illegal and said I had
                            in past been informed no incursion into territorial waters had occurred.
                            Re press leaks made conciliatory statement and expressed conviction
                                <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> had not given
                            information anymore than I had.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> said determination
                            whether rapprochement can be brought about between our countries
                            depended on a lot of concrete actions. Long as US occupies Taiwan,
                            continues to deprive Chinese of rights in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, and tries isolate China, he can hardly talk about US
                            friendship for Chinese people. His Government had formally issued
                            statement re territorial limits September 4, 1958<note n="4" xml:id="d149fn4">For text, see <hi rend="italic">American Foreign

                            despite repeated protests. He then launched into long dissertation re
                            territorial waters. Said US in 1793 had proclaimed three-mile limit and
                            if “unilateral” claims were involved, US had taken <pb n="305" xml:id="pg_305" facs="0341"/>lead in such. Said neither of our

                            asked on what grounds we should try to impose three-mile limit on
                            others. I suggested question of territorial limits throughout world was
                            vast one beyond scope these talks. <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> said in absence standard limit universally

                                order for 200 rubber assault boats. It noted reasons for believing
                                the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> wanted the boats for use
                                from the offshore islands and stated that granting an export license
                                might undermine U.S. policies of “attempting prevent provocations
                                from offshores” and “localizing any new offshores crisis if it
                                breaks out.” It concluded, however, that the question had to
                                considered in the context of other problems and stated, “If after
                                considering foregoing you personally want license issued, we will do

                            doubtless hopes to use these boats along with <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>-supplied equipment in eventual attack on mainland.
                            However, we do not believe that supplying these boats will significantly

                            demonstrating serious lack of trust in an ally. He said US and <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> had reached “psychological impasse”

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KAAG1">Kirk</persName> opened the
                            conversation by mentioning the various changes of top personnel in U.S.
                            Agencies. He took the occasion to point out that all heads of U.S.
                            Agencies in Taiwan operated under his general direction in accordance
                            with President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>'s
                            directive of May 29, 1961.<note n="1" xml:id="d151fn1">For text of the
                                letter which President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> sent on that date to all U.S. Ambassadors,
                                see Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, December
                                11, 1961, pp. 993-994.</note> He said he would like to present two
                            of the new agency heads to President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> at the President's convenience. The President
                            replied that he would be glad to receive them and that a time would be
                            set. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KAAG1">Kirk</persName> went on to
                            say that cooperation between the U.S. and <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> in the fields of economic aid, military aid and
                            diplomatic cooperation seemed to be going forward smoothly. President
                                <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> commented that they
                            found U.S. Agencies most cooperative.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KAAG1">Kirk</persName> said that the
                            Chinese Communist build-up on the Fukien Coast appeared to be completed
                            and the forces in that area were substantially stronger than they had
                            been prior to June 1962. We thought their purpose was probably defensive
                            but the possibility of aggressive action could not be excluded.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KAAG1">Kirk</persName> said that the
                            U.S. Government had noted an improvement in <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> intelligence, but it was still essential for both U.S.
                            and <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> intelligence agencies to work
                            harder. It would be very difficult for President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> to make sound decisions without
                            good and up-to-date intelligence.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> replied that there
                            could be little of what the U.S. Government regarded as “hard”
                            intelligence until and unless there was action against the mainland. The
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> had many sources of intelligence
                            which had not been revealed to the United States. Even if these should
                            be revealed he was afraid they would not be taken at face value. Many
                            such sources were based on oral arrangements and would not become known,
                            visible or tangible until action took place.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KAAG1">Kirk</persName> said that the
                            United States Government had been following closely <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> plans for an early small air drop.
                            Although U.S. intelligence people had some reservations concerning the
                            desirability of the area chosen, they were cooperating closely with the
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> in the preparations. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_KAAG1">Kirk</persName> added that this drop,
                            the first since 1959, should test the vulnerability of the Chinese
                            Communists and produce intelligence obtainable in no other way. He said
                            he assumed that the drop had not taken place within the last couple of
                            days because of the typhoon.</p>
                        <pb n="308" xml:id="pg_308" facs="0344"/>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> replied that there
                            had been two typhoons, one right after the other, which had flooded the
                            drop area and created many mountain freshets. Therefore, it was
                            necessary to postpone the drop for a few weeks. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KAAG1">Kirk</persName> said that was the reason we had
                            been uneasy about the area because there were so many rice paddies,
                            canals, and so forth. He remarked that when the 101st Airborne Division
                            was air-dropped into Normandy many soldiers landed in the flooded area
                            behind Utah Beach. This force was very embarrassed by finding itself
                            landing in deep water. President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> replied that was also the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>'s concern and that was why they had called off the
                            planned drop.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador told the President that in order to facilitate the small
                            drop program the U.S. Government now intended to send two C-123 aircraft
                            to Taiwan as soon as they were ready and the crews trained. Five Chinese
                            crews had already departed for the United States for training. The
                            President commented that this was good and he expressed his thanks.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KAAG1">Kirk</persName> inquired whether
                            his understanding was correct that the purpose of these air drops was to
                            test whether underground resistance elements could be contacted. The
                            President replied that it was. The Ambassador said only if such actions
                            were successful could we consider going further.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> said it was more
                            important for us to explore and locate weak points on the other side
                            where one or two thinly garrisoned or undefended cities could be seized
                            by means of a large air drop. Unless the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> were able to do that it would be difficult to rally
                            large numbers of people to rise against the regime. In such an event the
                            Chinese Communist armed forces, especially the officers with whom the
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> has established contacts, would
                            be able to rise. One or two cities must be seized before this could take
                            place. One reason the Communists transferred away from the coast troops
                            previously stationed there was because the Communists were afraid they
                            were becoming too friendly with the local people. However, their
                            transfer does not halt the contact between these troops and the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>. [<hi rend="italic">3-1/2 lines of
                                source text not declassified</hi>] The reason this information was
                            not passed to the U.S. was to enable the U.S. to stay clear of the
                            Communist charge that U.S. “imperialism” was meddling in Chinese
                            affairs.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KAAG1">Kirk</persName> said the United
                            States Government still feels action had best be limited to small air
                            drops, to which President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName>
                            replied that this matter could be discussed further.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>'s view was that United States actions must be
                            peaceful and defensive. Although the President had made a careful study
                            of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> requested for bombers and
                            landing craft he did not feel justified in making such items available
                            at the present time as they would certainly appear to be aggressive in
                            character. If circumstances <pb n="309" xml:id="pg_309" facs="0345"/>warranted it the United States Government would, of course, be willing
                            to reconsider the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> request.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> inquired what the
                            U.S. attitude would be in case of a large-scale rebellion on the
                            mainland. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KAAG1">Kirk</persName>
                            replied that that would have to be judged at the time. He could not
                            predict what the U.S. Government's attitude would be but he was sure
                            that the situation would be examined very closely to see what
                            opportunities arose. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KAAG1">Kirk</persName> continued that the U.S. Government was ready to
                            examine the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> proposals for overt
                            action. We have been working very closely with the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> through the 420 Committee on
                            intelligence matters. Overt invasion of a whole continent was quite
                            another thing which would require a close study of <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> plans and preparations.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> said that the
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> should, of course, keep the U.S.
                            Government informed and consult with it. However, if the U.S. Government
                            should continue to stop the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> from
                            going ahead with its plans the time might come when the government would
                            find it difficult to keep the people and army under control, especially
                            since the government had started to collect the special defense surtax
                            and had told the people what it was for. If there were still no action
                            after a certain lapse of time the people would lose confidence in the
                            government. The report that the United States Government had given the
                            Chinese Communists assurances that the U.S. would not help the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> had created an unfortunate impression
                            in the minds of people that the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            would be unable to act.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KAAG1">Kirk</persName> commented that
                            the U.S. position was limited to that set forth in the 1954 treaty,
                            according to which neither side was to take action without the agreement
                            of the other. Agreement meant examination of the facts and agreement on
                            action to be taken. It did not mean the extension of a blank check to go
                            ahead. What facilities did the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            possess for really making a landing on the continent? Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_KAAG1">Kirk</persName> said he had
                            participated in a couple of such landings and knew what was
                            involved.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> said of course the
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> is ready to abide by any
                            agreement it signed. However, there is a question of whether or not the
                            treaty concluded in 1954 is still applicable. Times and circumstances
                            have changed. Strict adherence to the treaty would enable the Chinese
                            Communist regime to prolong its life and continue to suppress the
                            Chinese people because the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> was being
                            bound hand and foot and prevented from going to their aid. Thus, the
                            treaty favors an enemy instead of an ally. It is all very well for the
                            United States to say that the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> must
                            stand by its agreement regardless of changes in the situation, but it is
                            hard for the President to tell this to the people. The U.S.
                            interpretation of the treaty is causing resentment in certain places and
                            giving rise to a feeling that the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>'s
                            ally is not helping the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> but helping
                            its enemy. This <pb n="310" xml:id="pg_310" facs="0346"/>is very
                            difficult for the people and the armed forces to accept. Does the United
                            States intend to hold to this position indefinitely?</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KAAG1">Kirk</persName> replied that the
                            treaty works both ways. Treaties are of course always subject to
                            revision. This could be studied if President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> desires to propose it. However, this is a serious
                            matter. Does President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName>
                            propose to denounce the treaty, and therefore desire that U.S. military
                            and other aid be halted? He didn't quite understand President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName>'s meaning. President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> responded that that was a policy
                            for the United States Government to decide.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that in addition to proposing increased cooperation
                            in the intelligence field, we had been considering the advisability of a
                            study group to consider plans for overt action against the mainland,
                            keeping in mind that this would be action against a continent and not an
                            island. He wanted the President to know that he had been busy about many
                            matters other than official calls during the past two months and was now
                            prepared to suggest such a study group. Perhaps President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> would like to consider it.</p>
                        <p>The President said that the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> must, of
                            course, keep the U.S. Government informed and consult with it, but the
                            U.S. Government must realize the great importance of the feelings of the
                            people and armed forces. The hopes of the people on the mainland are
                            such that it is impossible to deny them indefinitely. They hope for
                            deliverance, preferably with U.S. assistance. The U.S. may succeed for a
                            time in keeping this feeling down but not indefinitely. The U.S.
                            Government could state publicly that the question of the GRC's return to
                            the mainland is a Chinese domestic affair. Instead the U.S. Government
                            has taken on itself the responsibility of preventing the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> from going back. This could not go on
                            indefinitely. Eventually it would be difficult for any government to
                            keep things under control. The <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> is
                            ready to abide by the treaty but when things change the treaty must be
                            reconsidered. He knows Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KAAG1">Kirk</persName> has been working hard, that he is staunchly
                            anti-Communist, and that he is sympathetic with <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> aspirations.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KAAG1">Kirk</persName> said that
                            President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName>, in raising
                            questions about the treaty, had moved to a higher plane than the
                            Ambassadorial level. If he were not satisfied with the terms, perhaps
                            his Ambassador should take this up in Washington.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> responded that he
                            had spoken at some length on the treaty because it had been brought up
                            by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KAAG1">Kirk</persName>. Revision or
                            annulment of the treaty was one thing, but it was another to let the
                            world know that under the treaty the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            is not free to do this or that. This was not doing the United States any
                            good and was creating resentment. The U.S. could have said if a
                            large-scale uprising took place on the mainland this was an internal
                            matter. Instead the U.S. Government was <pb n="311" xml:id="pg_311" facs="0347"/>letting it be known that under the treaty the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> was not free to attack the
                            mainland.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KAAG1">Kirk</persName> reminded the
                            President that President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>
                            had heavy world-wide responsibilities. Just as President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> was responsible to the Chinese
                            people, so President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> was
                            responsible to his own people. He has as heavy a responsibility as any
                            head of state. The treaty of 1954 provides that agreement is
                            necessary.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> replied that he
                            was fully aware of President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>'s heavy responsibilities. He wished to assure
                            him through the Ambassador that he would not do anything lightly. He
                            would do nothing harmful to the prestige of the President or the United
                            States. All the President needs to do is to say that the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> action against the China mainland is
                            entirely a domestic matter. Such a declaration would also discourage, if
                            not prevent, any overt Soviet participation. He wished to reiterate his
                            assurances that he would do nothing contrary to the provisions of the
                            treaty but he wished the United States Government would devise ways of
                            helping the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> do its duty to its own
                            people without violating the provisions of the treaty. There must be
                            ways and means of doing this.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KAAG1">Kirk</persName> said that the
                            United States has responsibilities to its other allies in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and elsewhere. It could hardly send
                            bombers and landing craft to Taiwan in secret. Such action would be
                            regarded as aggressive.</p>
                        <p>The President said he did not have this equipment in mind when he
                            suggested that the U.S. try to find ways and means to help. What he
                            really had in mind was an appeal for a greater area of understanding
                            between the U.S. and the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>. The last
                            thing which the U.S. should wish to foster is the idea that the U.S. is
                            beginning to be a friend to the Chinese Communists while binding its
                            ally hand and foot. The U.S. should not permit the Chinese people to get
                            the impression that the U.S. did not distinguish between an enemy and an
                            ally. The U.S. was even holding up the export of goods the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> wished to purchase with its own money.
                            This was in effect applying an embargo to the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>. He wondered whether such an embargo was applied to the
                            enemy. He said he was speaking very frankly to the Ambassador as a
                            friend rather than as an Ambassador.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KAAG1">Kirk</persName> replied that it
                            was unnecessary to reiterate the friendship between the United States
                            and China which had a background of over a hundred years. As was well
                            known, for a long time all U.S. trade with Communist China had been
                            prohibited. There was no reason to say that the U.S. was being friendly
                            to an enemy. It was just that President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> and his advisors were unable to agree at the
                            present time to <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> plans and hopes,
                            taking into account the world situation.</p>
                        <pb n="312" xml:id="pg_312" facs="0348"/>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> said he hoped that
                            the longer Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KAAG1">Kirk</persName>
                            remained the deeper his insight would be into the importance of the
                            problem of the China mainland. What happened there would have a vital
                            affect on the rest of the world. It was for this reason that he felt it
                            necessary to speak as frankly as he did.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KAAG1">Kirk</persName> then explained in
                            more specific terms that what he had proposed earlier was the
                            organization of two groups. One to handle covert intelligence
                            operations, and the other to study overt operations. The first group
                            existed already in the form of the Joint Intelligence Committee (<gloss target="#t_JIC1">JIC</gloss>), while the second also existed, but in
                            a somewhat vague status, in the form of the 420 Committee. What we were
                            proposing was that expert personnel be added to the 420 Committee so
                            that it would be possible to examine <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            capabilities with its present equipment for amphibious operations in the
                            event of a mainland uprising. The President said that he would welcome
                            the organization of such a group. The Ambassador said this suggestion of
                            a study group needed reflection and examination prior to acceptance, and
                            then inquired who would probably act as responsible head of the group on
                            the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> side. Would it be the President
                            himself, the Vice President, the Defense Minister or someone else?
                            President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> replied this
                            would have to be given consideration. Perhaps it would be the Defense
                            Minister. He inquired who would head the American element of the group.
                            The Ambassador replied that he himself would.</p>
                        <p>On getting up to leave, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KAAG1">Kirk</persName> mentioned that <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">General

                            would be glad to receive him.<note n="2" xml:id="d151fn2">

                        <p>IMPRESSIONS FROM TAIWAN</p>
                        <p>1. <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> Objectives</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> mission which is currently in
                            effect in Taiwan is stated in the following terms:</p>
                        <p>a. Continue to assist the Chinese to develop a military force which is
                            capable of:</p>
                        <p>(1) Maintaining internal security;</p>
                        <p>(2) Deterring a Communist attack; or</p>
                        <p>(3) Defeating such an attack if short of an all-out Communist effort.</p>
                        <p>(4) Assisting US forces extensively in the event of a general war in the
                            Far East.</p>
                        <p>The foregoing language emanates from The Military Assistance Planning
                            Document and is applicable to Korea as well as to Taiwan. Because of the
                            open-ended nature of objective (4), under this language, it is possible
                            to justify the maintenance of a ChiNat force structure of almost any
                            size. Where there is no mention of the defense of the Off-shore Islands
                            as a specific objective, the language is broad enough to provide for
                            this mission.</p>
                        <p>Although guidance such as the foregoing does not offer precise guidelines
                            to assist the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>, it is my opinion
                            that the dollar ceiling of $160 million <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> per year has resulted in establishing reasonable
                            priorities consistent with the most pressing needs of the defense of
                            Taiwan, the Penghus and the Off-shore Islands. However, it would be
                            useful in justifying this program to Congress to have more precise
                            objectives, devoid of the open-ended features noted above. It is
                            interesting also to note that the foregoing statement of mission is not
                            the same as that contained in the <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> Military Assistance Plan, <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 64-68, another example of the need for a thoroughgoing
                            overhaul of the statements of <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>
                            objectives in all the countries visited thus far.</p>
                        <pb n="315" xml:id="pg_315" facs="0351"/>
                        <p>2. Possible New <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> Objectives for
                            Taiwan</p>
                        <p>If a revision of the statement of objectives is undertaken I would
                            suggest stating the mission as follows:</p>
                        <p>a. The maintenance of Chinese National military forces to accomplish:</p>
                        <p>(1) Internal security.</p>
                        <p>(2) The defense of Taiwan, the Penghus and the Off-shore Islands with
                            such U.S. assistance as may be agreed.</p>
                        <p>(3) The maintenance of an expeditionary force of three divisions for use
                            elsewhere in the Western Pacific.</p>
                        <p>The effect of taking such objectives would have little effect upon the
                            Air Force and Navy as now planned. In the case of the Army, it would
                            reduce the military requirement to not more than 15 divisions, of which
                            three would receive special treatment. The priorities in the hardware
                            program would thus be:</p>
                        <p>a. Modernized air defense (semi-automatic <gloss target="#t_ACW2">AC&amp;W</gloss>, introduction of the F104G, more <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss>).</p>
                        <p>b. Army and Navy equipment related to the defense of the Off-shore
                            Islands.</p>
                        <p>c. Modernization of three divisions.</p>
                        <p>d. Modernization of the remaining 12 divisions.</p>
                        <p>Items which should not be included in the revised program would be: tanks
                            in any significant number; amphibious lift beyond the present one
                            division level; and any <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss> capability
                            directed at the ChiCom submarine threat (this to remain a U.S.
                            responsibility).</p>
                        <p>3. Air Defense</p>
                        <p>As in the case of Japan and Korea, the most pressing military problem in
                            Taiwan is the provision of a modernized air defense. Here the conditions
                            are as elsewhere—the growing threat of an improving ChiCom air force
                            equipped with airplanes generally superior to those in the hands of our
                            Allies and deployed in depth on an extensive land mass. The restricted
                            areas of Japan, South Korea, Okinawa and Taiwan offer vulnerable targets
                            to this superior, modernized ChiCom air force. In all areas arises the
                            question of how to offset this danger.</p>
                        <p>I am impressed with the need to study this problem, not by individual
                            country but as an entity consisting of the entire Western Pacific area.
                            In planning for <gloss target="#t_ACW2">AC&amp;W</gloss>, it is
                            highly important that any new system introduced to one country be made
                            common to all. In all countries, we are faced with the problem of
                            introducing a high performance, all-weather interceptor, usually the
                            F104G. Based upon justifiable military requirements, it is quite easy to
                            run up an excessively high bill for interceptors which will require an
                            improved <gloss target="#t_ACW2">AC&amp;W</gloss> to exploit their
                            full capability. Thus, there are two heavy bills in the offing.</p>
                        <pb n="316" xml:id="pg_316" facs="0352"/>
                        <p>In contemplating the foregoing prospect, one is inclined to ask whether
                            there may not be some better solution to offset the ChiCom air
                            superiority in the Far East. I believe that we should look at the
                            possibility of a higher reliance upon surface-to-air and
                            surface-to-surface missiles as a more effective response to the threat.
                            The exact mix of surface-to-air missiles and interceptors for each
                            country is a problem for the experts to determine. However, any
                            SAM-interceptor combination is purely defensive and offers no deterrent
                            to the aggressive employment of the ChiCom air force. If, on the other
                            hand, the ChiCom knew that we had their airfields zeroed in by
                            surface-to-surface missiles or Polaris type missiles, the situation
                            would improve to our advantage. Further, these missiles should be
                            publicized to be appreciated by ChiComs and others. Before embarking
                            upon a large and costly program for improved local air defense, we
                            should evaluate closely present plans versus a solution based largely on
                            missiles supplemented by carrier aircraft.</p>
                        <p>4. Defense of the Off-shore Islands</p>
                        <p>A visit to Kinmen provides visible evidence of the determination of the
                            ChiNats to defend the Off-shore Islands to the last ditch. Whether this
                            is sensible or not is academic. The ChiNats are on the Off-shore Islands
                            and intend to stay. Their defenses are impressive and could be overcome
                            only at a prohibitive cost to the ChiComs.</p>
                        <p>In discussing the most dangerous kind of attack against Kinmen, I found
                            the Chinese officials in general accord. They believe that a surprise
                            attack under cover of darkness or bad weather would be the most likely
                            to succeed, particularly if the ChiComs treated the situation as a river
                            crossing rather than an amphibious landing. In the former case, they
                            would bring small craft in numbers down to the coast from inland without
                            producing any detectable alteration of activity in the coastal waters.
                            After assembling secretly, they would have a good chance of crossing
                            quickly the narrow waters separating Kinmen from the mainland and of
                            establishing a foothold before the ChiNats could react effectively. Such
                            a landing would probably be accompanied by parachute drops throughout
                            the island. The outcome, in my judgment, would be uncertain. But, even
                            if the island were taken, the price exacted from the ChiComs would make
                            it a Pyrrhic victory.</p>
                        <p>All American officials contacted in Taiwan agreed that the U.S. should
                            recognize, however reluctantly, that the ChiNats will continue to hold
                            and defend the Off-shore Islands. The Islands are valuable as outposts
                            for the main defense of Taiwan and the Penghus, as the site of early
                            warning radar and as a symbol of the determination of the ChiNats some
                            day to return to the mainland.</p>

                        <p>5. The Return to the Mainland</p>
                        <p>In an hour's discussion with <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang
                                Kai-shek</persName>, the President showed his unshakable confidence
                            in the readiness of the mainland to receive his liberating forces. He
                            does concede, however, the need for a preparatory phase in which the
                            people of the mainland would be given assurance of assistance and of
                            arms in case they rose in revolt. The parachute drops which he desires
                            to make are for this purpose. He regrets that the US withholds
                            assistance from his grand design and explains our reluctance as fear
                            that our assistance might provoke <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> into initiating World War III.</p>
                        <p>I assured him that, personally, I had no such fear but that we Americans
                            could not forget the experience of Cuba where overly optimistic friends
                            had undertaken an expedition of liberation in anticipation of a friendly
                            uprising ashore which did not occur. It was natural for us to ask for
                            hard evidence before sharing the Gimo's confidence. The President
                            assured me that he had ample agent reports to support his view, but
                            offered to produce nothing tangible.</p>
                        <p>It is becoming increasingly difficult to respond to the Gimo's demands to
                            be allowed to try to return to the mainland. Local U.S. officials feel
                            that some U.S. participation in realistic studies of possible landings
                            would help to show the Gimo and his associates the vast military
                            requirements for a return to the mainland. I understand that such
                            planning is underway and hopefully will demonstrate the magnitude of the
                            problem. While I am doubtful that this exercise will deflate the
                            optimism of the Gimo, it should have a salutary effect upon his
                            advisors.</p>
                        <p>It may be that we are storing up trouble for ourselves in not being more
                            frank with the Gimo in stating what our intentions are and are not with
                            regard to supporting him in a return to the mainland. He has
                            considerable justification to retain his hopes as long as we give a
                            certain approval to his maintenance of a force structure justified only
                            if he is indeed going to assault the mainland. Furthermore, we have
                            allowed him to raise his special budget for defense purposes, while
                            continuing to help him to meet the deficit in his over-all budget. It
                            must be hard for him to believe that there are not some situations in
                            which we will see him ashore.</p>

                            American U-2 September 9 on espionage mission and demand US stop such
                            flagrant aggression. Said reconnaissance solely directed by US which
                            held fully responsible for it. Said whole world knows this and ChiComs
                            possess ample evidence prove it. Referred to June 23 meeting when US
                            indicated no intention attack China and would not support
                                <persName>Chiang</persName> in such. Said plane intrusion not
                            consistent with pledge not to attack China by armed force and it evident
                            this latest aggressive act was important step by US to incite
                                <persName>Chiang</persName> attack Mainland. If present
                            administration any different in China policy from previous two, it is
                            that it is more adventurous and irresponsible as evidenced by U-2
                            incident. Stressed gravity of this “act of war provocation undertaken by

                            espionage aircraft shot down by ChiComs. Said matters could not go on
                            this way indefinitely. We are playing with fire heading toward war.
                            Demanded US “rein in horse in coming to edge of precipice,” stop
                            provocations and sit down to talk seriously regarding withdrawal US
                            forces from Taiwan and Taiwan Strait. Said <pb n="319" xml:id="pg_319" facs="0355"/>September 18 US destroyer again operated in waters off
                            Tsingtao on hostile reconnaissance mission. This is sixth such operation
                            since April. Said Chinese cannot ignore this for long and was instructed
                            protest this state of affairs.</p>
                        <p>3. I responded along lines paragraphs 3, 4 and 6<note n="3" xml:id="d154fn3">Paragraph 3 suggested that <persName corresp="#p_CJM1">Cabot</persName> observe that an “air of

                                and that what it did with them was its own affair. Paragraph 6
                                declared that the argument that U.S. manufacture of aircraft made
                                the United States responsible for their use was untenable.</note>
                            reference telegram and in doing so observed that <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> had repeatedly indicated in these

                            by any means including use of force and asked whether he then expected

                            ChiCom declared purpose. Continued with substance paragraph 9 reference

                                of international agreement, the United States protested all claims
                                of a 12-mile limit as unilateral assertions but that in the interest
                                of avoiding incidents, it did not as a general practice exercise its
                                legal rights with regard to passage and overflight to the full

                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> said U-2 espionage could
                            not be denied, was yet another provocation against China which raised
                            extreme indignation of Chinese people. Said attempt portray supply of
                            U-2 to China as commercial transaction did not fool anyone. Said U-2
                            stationed in many parts of world for espionage purposes and it well
                            known all under direct control of US. Asked how those stationed in
                            Taiwan could be exception. Said Senior official Japanese Defense Board
                            had said U-2s never previously been turned over to foreign country but
                            were under direct control US military. Said in fact all “criminal
                            activity” over Mainland was organized by <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> branch in Taiwan. Quoted <hi rend="italic">New York

                        <p>5. I said it was necessary consider historical development our dispute if
                            it was to be in proper perspective. Reminded <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> our difficulties really began
                            when ChiCom troops in defiance <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            resolution fought our troops in Korea who were there in pursuance UN
                            resolution. That made clear problem was international one. Referred
                            again to our treaty with <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> which we
                            intended carry out. Said as long as his side displayed aggressive
                            attitude, it was logical for a state threatened and for friends of that
                            state to take due precautions. Said his side had not only threatened use
                            of force but has used force repeatedly against GRC. Asked how he could
                            consider flight of unarmed plane over Mainland as act of provocation.
                            Said I had no intention giving <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> any information as to any military collaboration we
                            may be furnishing <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> but would <pb n="320" xml:id="pg_320" facs="0356"/>say his statements seriously
                            distorted. Referring to <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName>'s
                            claim his side had never sent aircraft into US airspace, reminded him
                            ChiComs had however sent many divisions their soldiers to fight US in
                            Korea. Said this was vastly more aggressive act than anything <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> had alleged re US activities.
                            Assured him statement in June 23 meeting continued to be policy my
                            government.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> said could by no means
                            accept “various justifications” for intrusion U-2. Re origin our
                            dispute, said it was US armed occupation Taiwan and US aggression Korea
                            which brought crisis in Far East. Since then US not only has not stopped
                            its aggressive acts against China but stepped them up. Said it was not
                            true US naval vessels had not entered territorial waters China. Tsingtao
                            area was special objective of reconnaissance and US vessels had gone
                            back and forth in this area in prolonged reconnaissance. This was
                            deliberate provocation. Repeated in detail his accusations re U-2. Said
                            to prevent recurrence U-2 incident and relax tension US should order all
                            American high-altitude planes from Taiwan, withdraw <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> branch from Taiwan, withdraw Task Force
                            of 13th Air Force, and all other forces.</p>
                        <p>7. I said did not recall we had ever complained re supplies sent
                                <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName>'s side by Soviets. If
                            carried <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName>'s argument to
                            logical conclusion, he might complain to US because some of weapons they
                            used in capturing Mainland cities were of US manufacture. Repeated we
                            were not occupying Taiwan but were there by agreement and degree our
                            support was question to be decided between US and <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>. I pointed out absurdity <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName>'s charge of aggression in
                            connection unarmed aircraft over Mainland. <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> replied it was matter of the sovereignty of a given
                            state to lay down breadth its territorial waters which were sacred and
                            inviolable. Intruding aircraft whether combat or reconnaissance is
                            aggression and cannot be tolerated by sovereign state. Said he did not
                            know what US would say if foreign aircraft intruded into its airspace. I
                            said we had both made our positions clear and saw no point in further
                            repetition.</p>

                        <p>On November 10, 1962, Director of Central Intelligence <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">John A. McCone</persName> met with Secretary of

                        <p>“I reviewed with the Secretary the plan <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> had developed [<hi rend="italic">7 lines of source text

                            occupation. I said this objective was a stated policy of the United
                            States adopted about 1958 and supported by <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>. I had gathered from discussions at the Special Group
                            some doubt as to whether this policy remained valid—some doubt as to
                            whether the United States really wished to exercise effort to free Tibet
                            of Chinese Communist occupation, and if there was an inclination to
                            change this policy, I wished to know it promptly [<hi rend="italic">less

                            long range plans developed in support of U.S. policy and because of the
                            weight given to these viewpoints, I felt that here again we were not
                            operating on a policy line but were acting from day to day in a manner

                            mentioned reftel, concentrated primarily on internal situation Communist
                            China, US-ChiCom relations and Sino-Indian border dispute. <persName corresp="#p_MDDS1">MacDonald</persName> prefaced remarks by stating
                            he had been allowed to visit every place he requested with exception of
                            Jehol which hosts said was too far away. (<persName corresp="#p_MDDS1">MacDonald</persName> wished trip to Jehol because of historic
                            interest.) Said he saw “hundreds of thousands” of Chinese, communes,
                            factories, iron and steel mills and believes has obtained true and
                            accurate picture of Mainland conditions and of attitudes of ChiCom
                            leaders on matters discussed below.</p>
                        <p>1. Internal Situation</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MDDS1">MacDonald</persName> convinced that ChiCom
                            leaders have gone through an “agonizing reappraisal”; that they have
                            learned their lesson, and that, although they know the country is still
                            vulnerable to nature, they have become more practical, more realistic
                            and more patient. He says this for three reasons: (A) Leaders
                            miscalculated speed with which country, particularly peasants, could
                            enter modern age. <persName corresp="#p_CEZE1">Chou En-lai</persName>
                            told him their plans had been over-ambitious. He saw factories which
                            were built two or three years ago and are now closed, although he was
                            assured they would reopen as soon as primary problem of agriculture was
                            ameliorated. (B) Withdrawal of Soviet technicians. Neither <persName corresp="#p_CEZE1">Chou</persName> nor <persName corresp="#p_CYCY1">Chen Yi</persName> would acknowledge any indebtedness to these
                            technicians but <persName corresp="#p_MDDS1">MacDonald</persName>
                            believes it an essential element of the necessity for reappraisal.
                            Chinese technicians he saw were excellently trained but young and
                            inexperienced. (C) Three bad harvests which undoubtedly caused real
                            hardship and suffering. According to <persName corresp="#p_MDDS1">MacDonald</persName> agriculture has first priority with those
                            industries related to it given only slightly lower priority. Iron and
                            steel mills are going full blast with a slight balance in favor of iron
                            smelt as ChiCom leaders now realize peasants not only prefer but will
                            have to use hand implements for “decades and decades.” He visited <pb n="323" xml:id="pg_323" facs="0359"/>mills at Nanchang and Wuhan. At
                            Loyang he saw factory producing 50 tractors a day, 15,000 per year.
                            Irrigation and chemical fertilizer plants are others high on priority
                            list.</p>
                        <p>Turning to communes <persName corresp="#p_MDDS1">MacDonald</persName>
                            said he thought they were smaller; 10,000 or less was average commune.
                            Communes have fewer functions than formerly and peasants, to whom cadres
                            must now pay heed, have more influence in handling agricultural
                            problems. Overall planning for area is still function of communes, but
                            production team or brigade is village unit. Peasants have no more land,
                            but agricultural produce and livestock have increased because of better
                            grain and stock. Peasants allowed to sell some produce on free
                            market.</p>
                        <p>In summation <persName corresp="#p_MDDS1">MacDonald</persName> said
                            people on the whole looked “hale and hearty” (there were “good spring
                            and fall harvests”); that they appeared reasonably content because
                            regime was giving them a little more of everything and they were better
                            off than they ever had been, but that it would take years, which leaders
                            realized, for Communist China to become modern nation. He ruefully
                            remarked that he had planned write series of articles on internal
                            situation for London Observer but had decided against it, thereby losing
                            1500 pounds, because he would have to paint “too favorable a
                            picture.”</p>
                        <p>2. US-ChiCom Relations</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CEZE1">Chou</persName> told <persName corresp="#p_MDDS1">MacDonald</persName> he was pleased with results
                            of Geneva Conference on Laos but that since that time there had been
                            marked deterioration in US-ChiCom relations: there were US soldiers in
                            civilian dress still in Laos; US had troops in Taiwan, Thailand and
                            Vietnam and now giving military aid to India. US was encircling China.
                            (Here <persName corresp="#p_MDDS1">MacDonald</persName> made obvious
                            observation to me that ChiCom leaders were intensely nervous about their
                            national security.)</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MDDS1">MacDonald</persName> told <persName corresp="#p_CEZE1">Chou</persName> that since new administration
                            there had been some changes in US policy toward Asian nations which had
                            gained world-wide acceptance and approval and suggested US scholars and
                            journalists be permitted travel throughout country in order inform
                            American public of true facts. <persName corresp="#p_CEZE1">Chou</persName> replied that US refused reciprocal arrangements,
                            that it imposed restrictions on Chinese; that there were Chinese in
                            prison [garble] which was reason for his holding prisoners and that
                            unless US agreed to reciprocity on all questions he was not prepared to
                            budge. In this connection <persName corresp="#p_MDDS1">MacDonald</persName> has impression ChiComs do not rule out
                            completely some type of exchange of scholars and journalists but it
                            would be impossible effect until after Indian border dispute
                            settled.</p>
                        <p><pb n="324" xml:id="pg_324" facs="0360"/>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CEZE1">Chou</persName> raised Warsaw talks and
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> (see reftel).<note n="2" xml:id="d156fn2">Concerning the Warsaw talks telegram 282 reported,

                                talks had been going on for seven years ‘with no results’ but that
                                he was prepared have them continue for another seven years.”
                                Concerning the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>, it reported that
                                    <persName corresp="#p_CEZE1">Chou</persName> had said the Taiwan
                                question was the business of the Chinese alone, had given <persName corresp="#p_MDDS1">MacDonald</persName> the impression that
                                “hidden contacts exist between <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                                leaders and ChiComs,” and had “emphasized his old line that Taiwan
                                would have nothing to fear from mainland takeover and would survive
                                as minority political group.”</note> Said most Taiwanese wished be
                            joined with Mainland but he was “patient” and was not going attempt
                            “violent” solution. On other hand <persName>Chiang</persName> was
                            “internal matter” not for outside (i.e. US) interference. <persName corresp="#p_MDDS1">MacDonald</persName> said <persName corresp="#p_CEZE1">Chou</persName> obviously wished assure him
                            privately Peiping had no intention of invading Taiwan but would never
                            state so publicly.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_CEZE1">Chou</persName> took exception to <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> position that Peiping was aggressor in
                            border dispute. Stated he realized <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                            must support India as member of Commonwealth but did not have to charge
                            Chinese aggression. He wished to go to conference table but India had
                            made impossible demands prior to discussions, particularly since
                            territory under dispute was not Indian but Chinese. <persName corresp="#p_MDDS1">MacDonald</persName>, of course, upheld <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> position. He thinks that ChiComs again
                            are concerned with internal security and believes they consider they
                            must have control of roads in that area to maintain military control of
                            Tibet. Also that ChiComs do not wish go beyond border incident stage
                            because of concern for their own domestic internal problems. He believes
                            they will attempt subversion in Bhutan, Nepal, Sikkim, Ladakh and
                            elsewhere in SEA but at this time they definitely will not attempt large
                            scale military aggression anywhere in Asia.</p>
                        <p>4. Other Items</p>
                        <p>(A) <persName corresp="#p_MDDS1">MacDonald</persName> believes ChiComs
                            intensely resentful of Soviet withdrawal of technicians. At every
                            opportunity emphasis was placed on Chinese having to “go it alone.”
                            While he never queried them directly on subject, he sensed a real
                            defiance of <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and a fiercely
                            independent attitude. (B) <persName corresp="#p_MDDS1">MacDonald</persName> did not see <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> but from films he saw of him thinks he looked old.
                            (C) When asked about succession, <persName corresp="#p_MDDS1">MacDonald</persName>

                        <p> US POLICY TOWARD COMMUNIST CHINA</p>
                        <p>I.</p>
                        <p>Purpose: This paper proposes specific policy decisions and actions
                            designed to secure maximum benefit to the US from the changing situation
                            in Communist China.</p>
                        <pb n="326" xml:id="pg_326" facs="0362"/>
                        <p>II.</p>
                        <p>Background: Strong elements of instability exist in Communist China in
                            consequence of economic difficulties and worsening relations with the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. To these must be added the
                            inevitable problem of succession as the aging veterans of the
                            long-march, who still absolutely dominate the leadership, pass from the
                            scene. While we cannot be sure of the long-run effects of these
                            disruptive forces, there is a good probability they will result in
                            either a lasting erosion of the capability of the regime to effect its
                            communist goals at home and abroad or in a basic change in orientation.
                            This probability is sufficiently great to justify tailoring US policy to
                            give it full play. There is also a possibility that the Chinese
                            Communist leadership, frustrated in many directions, will launch massive
                            aggression across their borders. Although they have thus far moved with
                            considerable caution, this contingency deserves steady policy
                            attention.</p>
                        <p>III.</p>
                        <p>Basic Policy Requirements: Our broad aims should be: (a) to avoid
                            actions, and to seek to induce others to avoid actions, that would
                            reduce pressures operating on the regime as it is presently constituted
                            and oriented, or would force the regime and the Soviets back into a
                            close association; and (b) within the limits of these requirements, to
                            maintain flexibility adequate to enable us to encourage and capitalize
                            on any movement toward significant favorable change within China.</p>
                        <p>To effect these aims we have need for: (a) maximum cooperation from
                            allied and friendly governments; (b) appreciation of our objectives and
                            the rationale therefor by the Congress and the American public; and (c)
                            minimal restraints on our freedom of action in consequence of our
                            alliance with the Nationalist regime on Taiwan.</p>
                        <p>The specific tasks we face are: (a) to refine and make more effective our
                            present policy of keeping the regime under pressure; (b) to isolate
                            touchstones of change in Communist China that would justify changes,
                            small or large, in US policy; (c) to maintain lines of communication
                            that will enable us to send signals as to our policy and intentions
                            regarding developments in China and to receive signals that may be
                            forthcoming from within China; (d) to respond to any concrete
                            indications of change in ways that would encourage movement toward a
                            favorable reorientation but would not contribute prematurely to a relief
                            from pressures operating on the regime; and (e) given convincing
                            evidence of a basic shift in Chinese policies and purposes, to be
                            prepared to adjust our own policies to the extent necessary to nail down
                            the shift and to use it as a basis for seeking a lasting resolution of
                            the China problem.</p>

                        <p>IV.</p>
                        <p>Recommended Policy Decisions and Actions: At the present stage<note n="1" xml:id="d157fn1">The recommendations made here do not cover all of
                                the measures necessary to meet the policy requirements set forth
                                under III above. They are limited to those necessary to get the
                                policy under way. As the situation develops and various
                                contingencies arise, appropriate additional steps can be taken
                                within the framework of this policy plan. The recommendations also
                                do not cover present policies which require no changes under the
                                plan. [Footnote in the source text.]</note> decisions and actions
                            should encompass the following:</p>
                        <p>A. Essential Foundations</p>
                        <p>1. We should formally adopt as the governing principles of our China
                            policy:</p>
                        <p>a. Continued firm US opposition to any relaxation of pressures on or
                            compromises with the Peiping regime unless and until concrete evidence
                            is given of an intention on the part of Peiping to alter its aggressive
                            policy and actions and to modify its stance of active hostility toward
                            the US and the non-communist world.</p>
                        <p>b. A willingness on the part of the US to meet any specific move by
                            Peiping toward relaxation with an appropriate corresponding move of its
                            own, although not necessarily in kind.</p>
                        <p>c. Readiness of the US to settle on an across-the-board basis its
                            differences with China if and when any regime in power convincingly
                            demonstrates by its policies and conduct, at home and abroad, an
                            intention to devote its energies and resources to meeting the legitimate
                            needs of the Chinese people and to establish on a lasting basis good
                            relations with the US, its Asian neighbors, and the western world
                            generally.</p>
                        <p>2. Following adoption of these principles, we should:</p>
                        <p>a. Take the initiative in explaining to key allied governments the US
                            position and the underlying rationale. We should seek to develop a sober
                            appreciation of the great advantage the Free World derives from even a
                            temporary preoccupation of Communist China with its internal problems,
                            and of the possibility that prolonged failures of the regime to solve
                            those problems can lead to a break of truly historical importance for
                            the Free World cause.</p>
                        <p>b. Inform the American public more fully of the problems and
                            opportunities incident to our China policy. Our aim should be an
                            understanding that our stance of reciprocal hostility, which will be
                            maintained as long as necessary, is not an end in itself but a means to
                            effect changes in China that will enable us to live at peace with
                            whatever regime is in power.</p>
                        <p>c. Systematically seek to reconcile the Chinese Nationalists to the fact
                            that our China policy must necessarily serve the broad interests of <pb n="328" xml:id="pg_328" facs="0364"/>the US and the Free World
                            generally rather than the interests of the Taipei regime alone. We
                            should clarify our policy toward Nationalist military action against the
                            mainland along lines set forth in paragraph B8 below. We should reaffirm
                            our lasting resolve to protect the security of Taiwan proper, but should
                            at the same time prepare the way for general policy adjustments which we
                            may come to consider desirable and necessary and which would not affect
                            Taiwanese security. (Should <persName>Chiang</persName> pass from the
                            scene at an early date, we should press on the successor regime this
                            educational campaign with special vigor.)</p>
                        <p>d. Take advantage of appropriate opportunities that might be offered in
                            the Warsaw talks to elaborate our basic thinking re problems affecting
                            US relations with China and the circumstances that could contribute to
                            their resolution.</p>
                        <p>B. Maintenance of Pressures on an Unregenerate Regime</p>
                        <p>3. In the interest of keeping the Peiping regime under pressure unless
                            and until it demonstrates a change of heart, our primary need will be to
                            continue present policies encompassing territorial containment, support
                            for peoples threatened by either direct or indirect Chinese aggressions,
                            direct military confrontation at various crisis points, preservation of
                            and support for the Nationalist regime on Taiwan, differential trade
                            treatment by the US and such friendly powers as the US can influence,
                            and attempts at maximum political isolation. It is important, however,
                            that we maintain an added alertness to frustrate maneuvers by Peiping,
                            or even by our friends, to break the line, and that we introduce certain
                            refinements and tactical variations in our policies to make them more
                            effective.</p>
                        <p>4. A continuing need is to stay on top of Chinese trade relations with
                            western countries. Since 1960, Chinese trade with bloc countries has
                            precipitously declined. Trade with the west has at the same time
                            increased, now equalling more than 50 percent of the total. This
                            proportional change has so far not involved a substantial shift from
                            bloc to western suppliers; the phenomenon reflects simple abstinence
                            with regard to bloc goods, particularly machinery, while large supplies
                            of grain have been procured in the west. The Chinese have, however,
                            shown interest in developing western alternatives to bloc sources. While
                            some shifts to the West may be desirable, we should attempt to prevent
                            any net improvement in the Chinese situation as a result.</p>
                        <p>a. We should make representations to all allied and friendly governments
                            to discourage liberalization of present trade practices, particularly
                            opposing grants of long term credits. In addition to utilizing the
                            rationale of our own China policy in these representations, we should
                            place special emphasis on the lessons to be drawn by the Free World from
                            Chinese attacks on India.</p>
                        <pb n="329" xml:id="pg_329" facs="0365"/>
                        <p>b. We should raise with the Canadians, Australians and French question
                            about grain sales to China in the context of the Chinese attack on
                            India. In addition to discouraging any improvement in credit terms, we
                            should lay foundations for a possible end to shipments in case China
                            renews the border conflict with India.<note n="2" xml:id="d157fn2">According to a <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> study of
                                November 27, grain shipments from western sources contributes
                                appreciably to the strength of the regime. Grain shipments, in fact,
                                appear the only economic lever the western world has against the
                                regime. [Footnote in the source text.]</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>c. We should take added steps to influence the Japanese to move slowly in
                            developing its trade with China. Although neither the current level of
                            Sino-Japanese trade, nor the currently indicated level for the near
                            future, is apt to affect significantly conditions in China, the
                            potential is quite important, particularly if Japan should allow
                            long-term credits or enter into intricate developmental barter
                            arrangements. The “lesson of India” as well as other considerations
                            should be kept constantly before the Japanese.</p>
                        <p>d. We should explore possibilities, and the advantages and disadvantages,
                            of denying to China petroleum from western sources should Peiping,
                            either on its own initiative or as a result of Soviet action, attempt to
                            shift from the Soviet market.</p>
                        <p>e. Should large-scale Chinese attacks against India be resumed, we should
                            explore possibilities of a total western embargo against China.</p>
                        <p>5. We should subject the regime to a more forthcoming psychological
                            drive. In particular:</p>
                        <p>a. We should encourage a full and continued public airing in the US and
                            abroad of Communist China's troubled situation and dimmed prospects, but
                            in a way that would not suggest a special campaign, which might be
                            counter-productive.</p>
                        <p>b. We should supply US missions, particularly in the under-developed
                            countries, with documentary and intelligence data on developments in
                            Communist China, and should instruct missions to arrange to keep
                            appropriate government officials and influential private citizens
                            informed of these developments on a continuing basis.</p>
                        <p>c. We should push diligently and begin early implementation of the
                            project already underway to minimize the impact of a possible Chinese
                            explosion of a nuclear device.</p>
                        <p>d. In continuing to oppose Communist China's admission to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            subsidiary organizations, and other international organizations, we
                            should tailor our arguments to reflect the basic principles of our China
                            policy as outlined under IV 1. above.</p>
                        <p>e. US officials should increasingly stress publicly US concern for the
                            welfare and progress of the Chinese people. We should emphasize <pb n="330" xml:id="pg_330" facs="0366"/>our willingness to help, with
                            the rest of the civilized world, the Chinese people if and as the
                            attitudes, policies and—by implication—make-up of the ruling regime make
                            this feasible.</p>
                        <p>6. It is especially important that we continue to do whatever may be
                            necessary to deny to Peiping, or to Communist elements generally, cheap
                            successes in Asia.</p>
                        <p>7. We should maintain, and if circumstances warrant step up, the
                            pressures resulting from our military presence in the Taiwan Strait,
                            Korea, and South East Asia.</p>
                        <p>8. We should avoid ourselves, and insist that the Nationalists avoid,
                            military operations against the mainland on a scale and of a nature that
                            would risk costly losses, furnish an effective rallying point for the
                            regime, invite a dangerous counter-move by the regime (e.g., an all-out
                            attack on the Offshores), or place us in the position of having to back
                            a losing ally or lose prestige. We should, however, support continued or
                            even substantially increased small-scale probes and clandestine
                            operations by the Nationalists which could be useful for intelligence
                            purposes, particularly as a means of testing the temper of
                            communist-armed forces and of the public, and possibly for keeping the
                            regime off balance. We should not, however, give such countenance to
                            these operations as would suggest, or escalate into, US commitments to
                            sanction increasingly pretentious Nationalist efforts. We should instead
                            gradually make clear to the Nationalist regime that the only
                            circumstance in which we envisage the possibility of their return to the
                            mainland would be one wherein they had in effect been invited to do so
                            by strong forces within China, which had already declared themselves
                            against the communist regime.</p>
                        <p>C. Touchstones for US Policy Changes</p>
                        <p>9. While pursuing a policy of pressures on an unregenerate regime, we
                            should maintain a constant alert for direct or indirect indications of
                            changes in the attitudes and policies of the rulers and should react in
                            ways designed to further movement toward a genuine reorientation.</p>
                        <p>a. The weight we attach to apparent signals should be heavily influenced
                            by the composition of the dominant element in the leadership at the
                            time. As a general rule:</p>
                        <p>—We should be wary of any gestures or maneuvers emanating from a
                            leadership still subject to Maoist control; we should not ignore Maoist
                            moves, but should limit our responses to atmospherics designed to test
                            how far <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> is prepared to go;
                            we should especially avoid responses involving exchange of relief from
                            pressures or important prestige gains for atmospherics or commitments
                            revocable at will.</p>
                        <p>—In case movement occurs in a “regular” succession situation (i.e.,
                                <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> had apparently died or
                            been incapacitated), we should match step with step, going as far and as
                            fast as the new leadership is willing to, but still exercising care not
                            to get ahead of the game.</p>
                        <pb n="331" xml:id="pg_331" facs="0367"/>
                        <p>—Should it be apparent that a coup had been effected against <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> or Maoist elements in the
                            leadership, we should assume optimum chances of progression to a basic
                            reorientation and shape our policies accordingly.</p>
                        <p>b. Our evaluation of Chinese moves should accord with their implications
                            for a basic change in orientation of the ruling regime rather than for a
                            simple “relaxation of tensions”.</p>
                        <p>—The prime test should be whether moves involve changes in attitude and
                            policies toward the US. This derives from the fact that hostility toward
                            the US, as the leader of the “imperialist” camp, is the keystone of the
                            Chinese revolutionary ideological system.</p>
                        <p>—We should be little impressed by overtures to “second” capitalist
                            powers, e.g., Japan, India, or even the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, unless accompanied by gestures the US, as these could
                            well be undertaken as a means of relieving pressures or as a maneuver in
                            the revolutionary game.</p>
                        <p>—We should also be little impressed by a revival of the “Bandung spirit”
                            or other steps involving renewed play upon “peaceful coexistence.”</p>
                        <p>c. With regard to specifics, we should look for and react favorably to:
                            moves involving a marked change in propaganda treatment of the US, a
                            change of stance regarding Taiwan, de-emphasis of the “national
                            liberation” theme for SE Asia, overtures to the US for renewed trade
                            relations, relaxation of restrictions on contacts with the non-communist
                            world, and proposals looking toward negotiations with the US without the
                            “pre-conditions” of the past.</p>
                        <p>d. Our evaluation of moves in the international sphere should be
                            importantly influenced by whether there are indications of an
                            accompanying relaxation of militancy on the domestic front.</p>
                        <p>10. Our responses to Chinese moves should aim at moving the process of
                            change forward rather than wrapping up immediate advantages. Until the
                            game gave promise of decisive results, US reaction should be guarded,
                            designed to keep the dialogue going, but stopping short of anything that
                            would give the regime important advantage or restrict our own freedom of
                            action to match in kind any sudden reversal.</p>
                        <p>11. We should not initially expect or even seek formal agreements or
                            negotiated quid pro quos. For some time at least, reliance should be on
                            parallel tracks of reading and sending signals. The principal area of
                            maneuver on our part should be in the trade field. Beginning with only
                            token steps to meet token gestures on Peiping's part, we should be
                            prepared to move progressively to a point where our trade policies
                            toward mainland China would correspond to those toward members of the
                            Soviet Bloc. Another area of maneuver that should be opened up once
                            substantial progress had been demonstrated would be military
                            confrontation. If, for example, Chinese propaganda attacks on the US
                            should be significantly reduced we might pull our naval forces back from
                            the <pb n="332" xml:id="pg_332" facs="0368"/>Taiwan Strait and operate
                            behind rather than forward from Taiwan. Given a more decisive move on
                            the Chinese side, say significant efforts to stabilize the situation in
                            Southeast Asia, we might respond by inducing the Nationalists to
                            evacuate the Offshores.</p>
                        <p>D. Contingency Planning for Disaster Situation</p>
                        <p>12. Although current indications do not suggest the likelihood of an
                            early turn in China that would lead to chaotic conditions, the magnitude
                            of the problems that would arise in this event, specifically in
                            connection with emergency relief, made desirable a comprehensive study
                            of the scale and urgency of requirements that would result and of the
                            possibilities with regard to meeting them.</p>

                            proposals, no progress made. <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> said during first stage of talks Chinese thought
                            pending resolution of main issues, we could deal with some minor
                            problems. Therefore, during 1956 and 1957 his side had many proposals,
                            e.g. lifting of trade embargo, exchange of persons and cultural
                            intercourse, rendering of judicial aid by both sides, and exchange of
                            newsmen. Claimed his side had not distorted record re newsmen but we had
                            rejected his reasonable proposal of September 6, 1960. Only after our
                            side had raised obstacles to solution various concrete matters had his
                            side concluded pending settlement to basic issue between two sides no
                            progress could be made.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> continued saying 9 more
                            serious warnings issued since previous meeting. Complained US had
                            engaged with ChiNats in big parachute maneuver in Taiwan and it was
                            matter of public knowledge that armed agents sent to mainland in attempt
                            prepare ground for invasion were all trained and equipped by US.
                            Enumerated series of visits by high-ranking US military officers to
                            Taiwan recently. Said <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">General
                                Taylor</persName> quoted <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Christian</persName> Science Monitor, US would probably use
                            tactical nuclear weapons in any conflict with Communist China. <hi rend="italic">Washington Post</hi> also reported many US military
                            men advocated nuclear weapons should be used in fighting in Asia. Said
                            our claim US would not be responsible if <persName>Chiang</persName>
                            attacked mainland without our consent was obvious attempt to prepare
                            ground in advance for shirking our responsibility in backing
                            invasion.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> continued accusing US of
                            meddling India massive military aid and instigating India to carry on
                            extensive war against China. Our apparent design was to utilize India to
                            strike at China and keep her engaged in a new direction.</p>
                        <p>4. I said I scarcely thought matter of American prisoners was side issue
                            as implied in <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName>'s remarks. We
                            feel strongly these men should be released under the one real agreement
                            reached in these talks. We have tried honorably carry out our side of
                            bargain.</p>
                        <p>5. Re newsmen, I said <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName>'s
                            proposal would in effect have us abandon solemn treaty with <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>. Did not see how he could consider
                            proposal reasonable or expect us do any such thing. Again denied we
                            occupying Taiwan. Re parachute maneuver I said it was true we furnished
                            certain military training advice. In view our defense treaty, we see no
                            impropriety in this.</p>
                        <p>Re alleged agents sent to mainland reminded <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> his side had repeatedly refused renunciation force
                            in area China and has repeatedly used force in that area. Could scarcely
                            expect other side remain passive <pb n="334" xml:id="pg_334" facs="0370"/>under circumstances. Said position I expressed to him last June
                            remained that of my government re mainland invasion.<note n="5" xml:id="d158fn5">Telegram 530 to Warsaw instructed <persName corresp="#p_CJM1">Cabot</persName> to state, if <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> mentioned <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName>'s threats of action
                                against the mainland, that he had explicitly stated the U.S.
                                position concerning attack on the mainland and had nothing to add to
                                or subtract from that statement.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>6. I said Government and people of US were shocked by open aggression his
                            side against India. Followed with substance paragraph 2 second reference

                                telegram.<note n="7" xml:id="d158fn7">Paragraph 7 of telegram 530
                                reported that Kuo Mo-jo, President of the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> Academy of Sciences and a member of the Standing
                                Committee of the National People's Congress, had charged in a
                                September 26 speech that <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> had surpassed Hitler and Tojo in savagery
                                and tyranny; it called this “highly offensive to American people”
                                and instructed <persName corresp="#p_CJM1">Cabot</persName> to ask
                                    <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> whether it
                                represented the view of the authorities on his side.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>7. In response my request for details, <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> listed by areas and dates alleged intrusions
                            serious warnings 215 through 221. I promised report these to my
                            government but assume they are available to Department through NCNA
                            broadcasts and Peoples Daily.</p>
                        <p>8. Re prisoners, <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> said not a
                            single American civilian in China and desiring to return was being
                            detained. Four American “convicts” are serving sentences. They committed
                            offenses against Chinese law and it is natural that they must serve
                            their sentences. Claimed there were number of Chinese desiring to return
                            but being obstructed.</p>
                        <p>9. Re Sino-Indian border, <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName>
                            said this question was legacy of history. Chinese Government had
                            consistently advocated fair and reasonable solution through peaceful
                            means. Peace-loving nations and people throughout world urging India
                            accept proposals made by Chinese Government. Said our Secretary of State
                            and Ambassador to India had been abetting and exhorting India to carry
                            out its military venture. Said we had openly announced recognition of
                            illegal McMahon line despite fact that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> in 1959 indicated US would not
                            recognize that line.<note n="8" xml:id="d158fn8">Reference is apparently
                                to Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Christian A.
                                    Herter</persName>'s statement at a press conference on November
                                12, 1959, that the United States had taken no position on the
                                Sino-Indian border dispute since the question had not previously
                                arisen. For text, see <hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy:
                                    Current Documents, 1959,</hi> pp. 1190-1191.</note> Asked
                            whether words of <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>
                            Administration or <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>
                            Administration were to be believed.</p>
                        <p>10. After reiterating familiar line re Taiwan, <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> then (in response to my mention
                            of Kuo Mo-jo's speech) said ChiComs almost daily had to put up with all
                            sorts offensive comments, attacks, and vilifications made by American
                            publications and high-ranking members US Government <pb n="335" xml:id="pg_335" facs="0371"/>against policies social system and
                            leaders his country. It was his side which had most to complain about on
                            this subject.</p>
                        <p>11. I said if <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> would furnish
                            particulars on Chinese desiring go to mainland but allegedly obstructed,
                            my government would be pleased investigate. Added if <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName>'s side wished under present
                            circumstances to alter arrangement whereby Indian Embassy is its agent
                            on this question, I am sure my government would have no objection. Said
                            we had never agreed because persons had been convicted constituted
                            reason for them not to be released under agreed announcement. Re Indian
                            border, I said we were not trying to establish what is right and wrong,
                            but what is clear is that his side by military action had taken
                            territory which had long been in Indian hands. We had furnished arms of
                            which he spoke only after heavy fighting had broken out. Added
                            penultimate sentence paragraph 6 first reference telegram.<note n="9" xml:id="d158fn9">The sentence reads as follows: “Apparent position
                                of <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName>'s side may be summed
                                up in few words: ‘Aggression consists in preventing his side from
                                using armed hostilities to accomplish its objectives.’”</note>

                            proved to be the greatest source of difficulties. The 16th meeting of

                            being pilloried as villain of this act with scanty attention to ChiNats.
                            Furthermore it appeared these broadcasts were being directed to many
                            parts of the world and again US accused of aggressive action. <persName corresp="#p_SC1">Shen</persName> said he also had become aware of
                            this heavy propaganda attack from Peiping and deplored its virulence
                            with some regret ChiNats captives had fallen into trap.</p>
                        <p>Then I pointed out that President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> held strongly view that United States must do
                            nothing now to be accused of aggressive action in Taiwan Straits area,
                            that as I had stressed to Generalissimo in my earliest talks (July 4 and
                            5) furnishing by US of B57's plus large numbers landing craft was not
                            consistent with above basic attitude, and that our position must
                            continue to remain steadfastly of such nature.</p>
                        <p>Also I remarked that repeated claims by “highest sources” here that
                            ChiNats were penetrating mainland with guerrillas, agents, etc. in

                            memorandum for the record by <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName>, January 11, reads in part as follows:</p>
                        <p>“<persName>Bundy</persName> then brought up the question of the estimate
                            of Chinese Communist nuclear capability, with its current status, and
                            what was the present estimate of when the ChiComs would explode a
                            device. He stated that the President felt that this was probably the
                            most serious problem facing the world today and intimated that we might
                            consider a policy of indicating now that further effort by the Chinese
                            Communists in the nuclear field would be unacceptable to us and that we
                            should prepare to take some form of action unless they agreed to desist
                            from further efforts in this field. <persName>Bundy</persName> said that
                            he felt the President was of a mind that nuclear weapons in the hands of
                            the Chinese Communists would so upset the world political scene it would
                            be intolerable to the United States and to the West. Apparently this
                            subject was also discussed at Nassau, although this was not stated. We
                            discussed in some detail the estimate. DCI pointed out to
                                <persName>Bundy</persName> that all facts upon which the estimate
                            was based were most uncertain; we knew very, very little about the
                            ChiCom production of uranium, their metal plants, their gaseous
                            diffusion plants; that we knew nothing whatsoever about their reactors,
                            we knew nothing about their chemical separation plants and, finally,
                            their weapon developments. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> advised <persName>Bundy</persName> of his program
                            for an intense intelligence effort in this field, which had been
                            discussed in recent days with DD/P.”</p>

                            Sino-Soviet dispute. The paper points out that the ideological conflict
                            between the two Communist parties and the divergence of the national
                            policies of the two governments are already so fundamental that, for
                            most practical purposes, a “split” has already occurred. From the
                            viewpoint of most of the rest of the world, the USSR and China are now
                            two separate powers whose interests conflict on almost every major

                            obviously have many important advantages for the West. However, the
                            emergence of a separate Asian Communist Bloc under the leadership of
                            China could have grave implications for U.S. security interests in the
                            Far East because of Peiping's militant and intense anti-Western

                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> addressed the
                            National Security Council at its 508th meeting on January 22, 1963. An
                            unsigned summary of his remarks prepared by a Department of State
                            official reads in part as follows:</p>
                        <p>“He expressed great concern about the possibility of the Chinese
                            Communist nuclear capability. He thought a test ban agreement might
                            produce pressure against development of such a capability. Any
                            negotiations that can hold back the Chinese Communists are most
                            important, he said, because they loom as our major antagonists of the
                            late 60's and beyond.” (Department of State, Central Files,
                            711.5/1-2263)</p>

                        <p>Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> commented on the President's
                                <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> statement in a January 23 letter
                            to <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>. It reads in part as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p>“To my mind, the most important matter in the interest of our security
                            which you touched upon was the question of attempting to prevent Red
                            China from obtaining nuclear capability, and the possibility of working
                            with the Soviets to this end. They undoubtedly would want a similar
                            understanding regarding West Germany.</p>
                        <p>“This matter has come up in a general way in conversations I have had
                            with several Russians. They always indicated Kremlin concern over the
                            remilitarization of Western Germany, and particularly over the
                            possibility of her obtaining independent nuclear capability. In this
                            connection, I have usually suggested that the Soviets must have similar
                            concern regarding Red China.”</p>
                        <p>After comments relating to Germany, the letter continues as follows:</p>
                        <p>“As far as China is concerned, in a conversation with one Russian
                            representative, I asked what was the use of our coming to an agreement
                            on a test ban without Red China. He replied that if the United States
                            and the Soviet Union agreed, world opinion would prevent China from
                            acting independently. The earnest manner in which he spoke gave me the
                            impression that what the Kremlin had in mind was that with such an
                            agreement, together we could compel China to stop nuclear development,
                            threatening to take out the facilities if necessary. In any event, I was
                            glad to learn that you put this subject so high on your priority
                            list.”</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> also wrote: “We are
                            making progress in Taiwan in regaining our ‘independence.’” He noted
                            that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KAAG1">Kirk</persName> was to
                            return to the United States for surgery, and stated, “While he is here,
                            I hope we would have a chance to talk with you about Red China,
                            including the future of Taiwan. The Generalissimo seems to be becoming a
                            bit obstreperous and we need some guidance.” (Library of Congress

                        <p>After the usual exchange of friendly remarks, I said that we were facing
                            the period of spring fever, that the bellicose statements of the Gimo
                            and others publicly announcing this was the year and that they were
                            ready to go, time was ripe, now or never; and that we knew pretty well
                            what was going on in terms of building <gloss target="#t_LCM1">LCM</gloss>s, training parachutists to form an airborne division,
                            etc.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy plus <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>, plus the service attaches, plus Taiwan Defense Command
                                (<gloss target="#t_TDC1">TDC</gloss>) ought to warn us of impending
                            unilateral action in forces, but I said it is possible for the Chinese
                            to make a quick airlift employing all their available C-46's, C-47's,
                            etc., lifting 5 and 10 thousand men. This kind of force could take off
                            in the dark or early dawn. We would have considerable trouble in
                            detecting it and certainly in stopping it.</p>
                        <p>While the Gimo protests that he would never violate the terms of the
                            Mutual Defense Treaty, that he was a man of honor, that he resented the
                            Ambassador referring to that Treaty every time (three times) I saw him,
                            yet we are all uneasy. In fact, the Gimo sent a message by <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Admiral Felt</persName> to the effect that
                            President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> should be
                            informed that the Gimo would never violate his word, etc. etc. (I was
                            informed of this after the event.) This poses some problems about the
                            propriety of military and other personalities allowing themselves to be
                            drawn into conversations by the Gimo on political matters. After all the
                            American Ambassador is the channel for such things, and military and
                            others should not allow themselves to be trapped in any such discussions
                            nor serve as a medium of transmission of messages indirectly to the
                            President of the United States. In fact, Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName>
                            and I discussed how to deal with the paper that <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Admiral Felt</persName> was given at the airport
                            in Taipei, which was the Chinese interpreter's paper as to what the Gimo
                            had said to <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Admiral Felt</persName>.<note n="1" xml:id="d165fn1">Reference is apparently to the Chinese record

                                “Important Principles Guiding the Landing of Chinese Government
                                Forces on the Mainland” with six points. The first four points
                                concerned the size of forces to be landed and the area where
                                landings might be made. Point 5 stated that the United States should
                                not be involved. Point 6 reads as follows:</note> The argument was
                            that it was a “sovereign right” on their part and not anything to do
                            with the United States, that the United States would not be involved. It
                            does, however, pose the serious question of what is to happen if those
                            divisions get in trouble and have to be rescued. Mr.
                                <persName>Bundy</persName> agreed that it poses a serious problem
                            and how to stop a large operation of this kind was difficult. A direct
                            warning not to do such a thing in advance might be ignored or might be
                            hard to deliver in person to the Gimo.<note n="5" xml:id="d165fn5">

                            other hand, it would not be unreasonable to assume the Chinese
                            Communists <pb n="344" xml:id="pg_344" facs="0380"/>might use air attack
                            either to bomb China troops coming by sea or to bomb the port of
                            embarkation and airfield on Taiwan. The question then arises: should the
                            7th Fleet come to the succor of the Chinese Nationalists or the defense
                            of Taiwan itself? Possibly the ChiComs would refrain from overt attack
                            on Taiwan, the Penghus, or the Offshore Islands in order not to embroil
                            the United States.</p>
                        <p>“This kind of military action is China's domestic affair, and is the
                            exercise of her sovereign right as an independent nation, and as such it
                            has absolutely nothing to do with any other country.”</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, the U.S. Government must have some plan as to what is to be
                            done on our part in the event the Gimo exercises “sovereign rights” and
                            does something of this kind to our definite discomfiture.</p>
                        <p>In this connection, we then discussed the delivery of the C-123's and
                            mentioned the hassle on the alleged bad faith of the United States in
                            not making all five of them available on Taiwan now.<note n="6" xml:id="d165fn6">

                                611.93/1-3163)</note> My position was that the first two should be
                            delivered when they are completely prepared but I was strongly against
                            sending the other three out this spring or summer. Were all five to be
                            on Taiwan, it seems to me a definite risk that they would be employed
                            for large drops with or without our concurrence. If “large drops” were
                            made somewhere inland carrying between two and three hundred Chinese
                            troops, to seize a town or an area disaffected, and then get into
                            trouble, the Gimo would want to go and bail them out willy-nilly. Here
                            again we are in trouble. Consequently, Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName>
                            and I felt it would be better to give them the two C-123's as soon as
                            fully ready but not to send the other three until after next fall after
                            the summer period of tension has passed. While we both knew that the
                            other three 123's might be employed for different types of operations
                            elsewhere, my feeling was they must stay outside the control of the
                            Gimo, i.e., at Okinawa or possibly Clark Field.</p>
                        <p>I explained that I was under constant pressure to agree that certain
                            things could be done by the Gimo with his own money from his special
                            preparedness tax. Some of these things did not involve the United
                            States. My position had been consistently that use of these sums to buy
                            equipment in other areas used up the resources of foreign exchange, were
                            definitely inflationary to the economy of the Island, and objectionable
                            from many points of view. Here I remarked that it should be remembered
                            that the Vice President, Mr. Chen Cheng, had assured me that special
                            preparedness tax would expire 30 June 1963, and would not be
                            renewed.</p>
                        <p>We talked about the success of my country team, which I explained was due
                            to the caliber of U.S. military or civil people in charge. They were
                            harmonious and outstanding, we shared our points of view, and worked
                            together shoulder to shoulder. All these men understand they are working
                            for the President of the United States and not for the President of
                            China.</p>

                        <p>After kind inquiries on the part of the President about my health, I said
                            at once to him that I was in trouble this spring and summer and I was
                            afraid he might be in trouble too; that the spring fever trouble was on,
                            and the Gimo, now 76, having recovered from an operation similar to my
                            own, having promised the people he would return to the mainland sooner
                            or later, felt that now he must go. The Gimo speaks of the morale of his
                            troops and the necessity of not keeping everybody at fever pitch too
                            long. Then I explained that the gist of our study of the Chinese
                            military plan for the invasion of the Mainland had been given to the
                            Gimo by me on January 16. He had insufficient attack force for sea lift,
                            air cover, supply and everything that went to make an invasion of a
                            continent possible. I said further that from high sources we knew the
                            Chinese military and other authorities were counting on dragging the
                            United States into the party. The President then asked if they got
                            ashore, could they stick? And I said, no, not without our help. He asked
                            if the recent teams had been successful and I said all nine had been
                            captured. They had lasted 7 to 10 days, that the Peiping Government had
                            accused the United States of fostering the whole operation, that of
                            course the equipment captured with the team was made in the United
                            States and such was being exploited to our disadvantage.</p>
                        <p>I explained in connection with the Blue Lion study that I had said to the
                            Gimo that 20 years had elapsed since the amphibious operations of the
                            last war and that one must be prepared for different kinds of tactics
                            now. The Gimo had agreed but said the ChiComs were not up-to-date in
                            such matters. Whereupon the President questioned what the Gimo thought
                            about India. Were the ChiComs ok? I replied the Gimo had said it was not
                            the question of ChiCom superiority, the Indians were no good
                            whatever.</p>
                        <p>We then touched on the C-123's and I said only two should go now, that
                            despite the hassle over matters of good faith or not good faith, that is
                            what we said we would give and that is all we will give. That I was
                            opposed to sending five to Taiwan as the ChiNats would then try to make
                                <pb n="346" xml:id="pg_346" facs="0382"/>a large drop of 250 to 300
                            men and then we would have to send a fire rescue party to get them out.
                            The President said, how many men can they take? The Chinese would pack
                            from 250 to 300 men in them willy-nilly. Again I reiterated that the
                            Gimo and his cohorts would expect the United States to come to the
                            rescue and we would then be dragged in whether we wanted to or not.
                            Further, I said I am sure that the Gimo et al. based everything on
                            dragging us in.</p>
                        <p>I touched briefly upon our experience with the Gimo as the war in Asia
                            drew to a close, when he flatly rejected our advice not to attack the
                            ChiComs north of the Yellow River nor pursue them westward. The Gimo
                            tried to regain Manchuria and lost his armies and their equipment. He
                            went westward and again met disaster. He misgoverned the area south of
                            the Yangtze and was detested by the local Chinese. He complained the
                            U.S. let him down, and I felt if he ever did get back on the Mainland he
                            would be ungrateful to the United States, and be very difficult to
                            handle.</p>
                        <p>I told the President I had difficulty in seeing the Gimo, that he fobbed
                            me off, felt that I did not understand the Chinese, and that I always
                            brought up the Treaty. I further said that visitors were occasionally
                            given messages to convey to President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> in indirect means of a type that really should
                            be sent through the U.S. Ambassador. It showed the Gimo could not get
                            very far with me and he tried other and devious means of getting around,
                            an old Chinese trick.</p>
                        <p>At the end I pointed out we had a difficult personality in the Gimo, age,
                            health, glory, obstinate, etc. The President was good enough to say he
                            had excellent reports about the mission and was gratified. I replied
                            that my people all understood they were working for the President of the
                            United States and nobody else. The President asked if I liked living
                            conditions in Taiwan and I said not very much. That I wanted to get back
                            as soon as I could, that I wanted to be there before the spring fever
                            advanced; that I would be ambulatory after a little while and would be
                            available if he wanted to send anyone out to Bethesda to talk with
                            me.</p>

                        <p>DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KAAG1">Kirk</persName> has just returned to Washington and has told me
                            about a misunderstanding which he feels has needlessly complicated the
                            channels of communication between our Governments. In these critical
                            times, I feel strongly that it is of the utmost importance that these
                            channels remain as clear as humanly possible. I have made a special
                            effort in my Administration to insure that my Government speaks with one
                            voice. Consequently, where it appears that there has been a failure of
                            understanding, I am most anxious to take the measures necessary to
                            overcome it.</p>
                        <p>Since Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KAAG1">Kirk</persName> will be
                            confined for a while in the hospital, I have directed [<hi rend="italic">1-1/2 lines of source text not declassified</hi>] to discuss a
                                proposal<note n="1" xml:id="d167fn1">According to a March 5
                                memorandum [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] the
                                proposal [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] reported on
                                March 1 that he had discussed it with <persName corresp="#p_CC2">Chiang Ching-kuo</persName> on February 28. The memorandum
                                indicates that the proposal was to send the C-123 planes at issue to
                                Taiwan and that they would remain under U.S. control and ownership
                                for use in South Vietnam with <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                                crews; they would be used in mainland operations only in case of
                                joint agreement. (<persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>

                                February 14 memorandum and the March 1 report have not been
                                found.</note> with your representative which I hope will satisfy the
                                [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>] needs of both our Governments. Later, Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_KAAG1">Kirk</persName> will return to his post
                            in Taipei, and I hope you will be able to explore with him at some
                            length and in some detail the larger issues which concern us both.</p>
                        <p>I know you feel as I do that between nations with such a historic
                            friendship as ours, the greatest good is to be obtained through a frank
                            and continuous discussion of common problems. Please consider that
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KAAG1">Kirk</persName> is my personal
                            representative in the most intimate sense and is unusually well equipped
                            to carry on a frank exchange of views on my behalf.</p>
                        <p>I was especially happy to learn from Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KAAG1">Kirk</persName> that you have fully regained your
                            health and strength after your illness of last year.</p>
                        <p>Pending Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KAAG1">Kirk</persName>'s return
                            to Taipei, do not hesitate to write me your thoughts through our Charge,
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CRN1">Clough</persName>, to whom I am

                        <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> opened saying since last
                            meeting <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> had increased tension in
                            Taiwan Straits area and furthered hostile acts in Asia as whole. Serious
                            warnings 222 through 230 issued and special emphasis given activities
                            destroyer Edgar Holm (?) off Fukien and KWang Tung coasts and its entry
                            into territorial waters east of LeiChou Peninsula at 0705 on December
                            19. <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> termed this outrageous
                            provocation and demanded our side put an end to such.</p>
                        <p>2. He then accused us of jointly planning and organizing recent
                                “<persName>Chiang</persName> gang” activities against Mainland. Said
                            they had abundant evidence establish our complicity these matters.
                            Complained we had set up guerrilla section under <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> for such purposes. Also complained of
                            “blue sky” joint maneuvers and of increased aid in form F104Gs and new
                            U-2 planes despite President's earlier saying we had no plans to sell
                            further U-2s.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> made quite a point of
                            fact ChiComs would hold <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> exclusively
                            answerable for <persName>Chiang</persName> harassments large or small
                            now or in the future. Also claimed we were trying to turn Sino-Indian
                            dispute into another front against China and at same time were urging
                            Japan to join with South Korea in setting up Northeast Asia military
                            bloc to serve our purposes in preparing for nuclear war.</p>
                        <p>4. I said I had to disagree with practically everything <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> had said. Said I would report
                            warnings as usual (assume Department has them already) and especially
                            the one alleged clear intrusion into territorial waters. Followed with

                            agents to Mainland. Said our accusation continued activity in Laos was
                            pure fabrication. Said US had not yet withdrawn all its military forces
                            from Laos and it is US which should be condemned for maintaining troops
                            there. Said illegal persecution by India of Chinese nationals was not at
                            all to be compared with China's retention of mere handful of American
                            “criminals”. <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> then warned US
                            against sending aid to India saying this would prove not to be in our

                        <p>6. I said we could not accept <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName>'s seeming view our ships and planes do not have

                            complaining that US ship movements in that area were not “normal.” I
                            said I thought we could both agree on fact that conditions in that area
                            were not normal either but those conditions have to be met. I pointed
                            out several governments claim Paracels. As for Laos we had scrupulously
                            observed all provisions Geneva agreements and regretted ICC had been
                            obstructed from observing activities in Communist-controlled areas. Said
                            we could not accept warning about giving aid to India. US will consult
                            its own interests in this matter. I then covered newsmen subject in

                            refusing accept their reasonable proposal of September 6, 1960, designed
                            to seek eliminate estrangement between two governments by settling

                        </list>
                        <p>I have reviewed our policy on treatment of the Sino-Soviet conflict by
                            United States officials which is contained in Circular Airgram 5667,
                            November 22, 1962.<note n="1" xml:id="d169fn1">The airgram, sent to all
                                U.S. missions, stated that official treatment of the Sino-Soviet
                                conflict should “(a) insure world opinion aware inconsistency
                                relations communist countries and opportunities this offers West (b)
                                furnish rationale for policy changes US may find desirable in view
                                dispute (c) deny communists monopoly in interpreting their problems
                                and (d) counter communist efforts paper over seriousness differences
                                and therefore maintain fiction of non-existent monolithic unity.” It
                                cautioned against exaggerating the dispute's impact on cold war
                                problems or suggesting that U.S. interests were better served by one
                                party than the other. (Ibid., 661.93/11-2262)</note> This airgram
                            was not sent to me for clearance, and I had not previously seen it.
                            There are some statements in it with which I would disagree, but doubt
                            that these are serious enough to attempt to clear a revision.</p>
                        <p>There are several points to which I draw your attention, however, since
                            they bear on the problem of the extent to which United States officials
                            should initiate public discussions of this problem. For example, on <pb n="351" xml:id="pg_351" facs="0387"/>page three of the airgram, it
                            is stated “A general understanding of what is taking place in the
                            communist world would serve both to give impetus to the fragmentation of
                            the communist movement and to diminish the effectiveness of the
                            communist appeal. Accurate publicity given the dispute would exacerbate
                            problems of discipline in the world communist movement and in individual
                            parties.” My own view is that strong emphasis by United States officials
                            tends to increase the pressure of the other communist parties upon the
                            Soviets and Chinese to patch up the quarrel and get together. It seems
                            to me there has been ample publicity in the press about this
                            problem.</p>
                        <p>The airgram states that officials should avoid any suggestion that the
                            United States is taking sides in the dispute. While I think this is
                            debatable in view of the fact that the Chinese are advocating a more
                            militant, aggressive policy against the West, and the United States in
                            particular, the airgram, in fact, appears to be taking the Chinese side,
                            particularly in the Major Points of Stress, beginning at the bottom of
                            page four. Point one, in particular, states that the great issue in the
                            conflict is the question of Moscow's authority over the communist camp.
                            While it is scarcely our business to assess blame, we surely should not
                            come down on the side of the Chinese who advocate a policy much more
                            dangerous for us, at least in the short run, than that advocated by the
                            Soviets.</p>
                        <p>The paper also omits any mention of some of the causes of conflict, such
                            as Soviet concern over the Chinese population explosion, psychological
                            antipathy, etc.</p>
                        <p>In any event, all I would suggest for the present is that you issue a
                            directive to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRJ1">Manning</persName>, a draft
                            of which is attached,<note n="2" xml:id="d169fn2">Not found. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>'s memorandum cited in the
                                source note above concurred with his proposed directive, and an
                                unsigned note attached to the source text indicates that it was sent

                        <p>2. It seems to me quite clear that in <persName>Chiang</persName>'s

                                reads in part as follows: “The President again wished to give

                                related agreements but felt something had to be done to solve the

                            referred to September conversation with Ambassador,<note n="4" xml:id="d170fn4">See <ref target="#d151">Document 151</ref>.</note>
                            at which <persName>Chiang</persName> pled for U.S. devise some means by
                            which he could fulfill his obligation to rescue Chinese on mainland
                            without involving U.S. or violating his treaty obligations. We have had
                            other recent indications that <persName>Chiang</persName> feels
                            frustrated by limitations placed on him by 1954 exchange of notes and is
                            groping for means to gain greater freedom of action. To what extent he
                            really hopes to get greater freedom of action and to what extent his
                            objective is a public posture of greater freedom of action is unclear.
                            What he seems to be seeking is formula by which U.S. would agree in
                            advance, or perhaps only appear to agree in advance, not to oppose his
                            taking armed action against mainland and once <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> action was underway, to publicly declare a hands-off
                            policy and disclaim any responsibility for it.</p>
                        <p>3. It is clearly not in U.S. interest under present circumstances to give
                                <persName>Chiang</persName> greater freedom of action. Consequently,
                            believe we should avoid getting into discussion of subject with him if
                            possible, as outcome could only be unfavorable to his hopes and likely
                            to result in intensifying <pb n="353" xml:id="pg_353" facs="0389"/>his
                            feeling of frustration. Yes, I think it important to find means of
                            exploring his purposes more deeply.</p>
                        <p>4. Recommend, therefore [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source
                                text not declassified</hi>] be instructed respond to <persName corresp="#p_CC2">Ching-kuo</persName> as follows on this point:
                            Questions relating to treaty should, of course, be taken up through
                            diplomatic rather than intelligence channels. However, Ambassador is
                            away and it would be undesirable in any case put forward any formal
                            proposal which Washington could not accept. Some informal discussion
                            seems called for, as we do not understand why existing treaty and
                            exchange of notes do not provide acceptable framework for action against
                            mainland if circumstances should permit. Perhaps <persName corresp="#p_CC2">Ching-kuo</persName> or Foreign Minister could give
                            Charge a more detailed explanation of President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName>'s thinking.</p>

                            a brief trip to the Western Pacific in October, including a 1-day visit
                            to Taiwan. It instructed Charge d'Affaires <persName corresp="#p_CRN1">Ralph Clough</persName> to inquire whether such a visit would be
                            convenient. The fact that the President was considering it was not to be
                            made public, since the trip was necessarily contingent on his other
                            responsibilities. (Department of State, Central Files, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 7 US/<persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>) Telegram 724 from Taipei, March 26, reported

                            </item>
                        </list>
                        <p>1. The basic situation as of now seems to require decisions on our part
                            as to what we are going to do in the event of:</p>
                        <p>a. A minor harassing invasion of the Mainland,</p>
                        <p>b. Build up of minor forces successfully landed on the Mainland,</p>
                        <p>c. Chinese attempts to succor or relieve beleaguered forces from a. and
                            b. above, by large-scale operations.</p>
                        <p>2. The fundamental questions confronting the United States Government
                            are:</p>
                        <p>a. Whether the retention of the island of Taiwan in friendly hands is
                            vital to the interests of the United States in the Western Pacific
                            and</p>
                        <pb n="355" xml:id="pg_355" facs="0391"/>
                        <p>b. How and when are we going to make it clear to President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> that a feeble attempt to assault
                            the Mainland, with the intention of involving the United States
                            Government in a first-class war with the ChiComs, cannot and will not be
                            tolerated.</p>
                        <p>3. a. It would appear that the decision as to whether or not Taiwan is
                            “vital” to our interests needs to be reviewed. This would require
                            re-examination and a decision taken at the highest level.</p>
                        <p>b. The United States is committed, of course, to the Mutual Defense
                            Treaty of 1954 together with its accompanying Exchange of Notes. The
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> in turn is committed thereby not
                            to use force against the Mainland without our “agreement.” This
                            obligation the Generalissimo is currently trying to escape.</p>
                        <p>4. A major revolt on the Mainland against the ChiCom authorities of
                            Peking of real magnitude may warrant military action by the United
                            States Government to overthrow Communism on the Mainland of China.
                            Decision in this matter would require very complete intelligence as to
                            what was happening on the Mainland. We must be aware from the “Tibetan
                            Papers” that sharp unrest did occur in north China (Honan) in 1960.
                            Apparently at the time it was not known to our own Government or to the
                            Government of <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName>.
                            Despite contrary claims, it is my opinion intelligence sources from the
                            Mainland of China are very inadequate. In the major Communist states,
                            such as the Soviet Union, to acquire accurate information of disorders,
                            discontent, revolt, revolution, etc., has been found most difficult if
                            not impossible. It should be further noted that as of now no major
                            political character of the ChiCom Party has defected. Similarly no
                            highly placed officer in the ChiCom armed forces has defected.
                            Consequently claims made by the Generalissimo and others of his
                            Government that widespread discontent does exist must be looked at
                            askance.</p>
                        <p>5. On the other hand, there is a theory expressed from time to time by
                            the Minister of National Defense, Mr. Yu Ta-wei, as well as General
                                <persName corresp="#p_CC2">Chiang Ching-kuo</persName>, to the
                            effect that any landing anywhere would produce a “detonation” resulting
                            in widespread acclaim and adhesion to the forces of Nationalist China
                            which would result in overthrow of the government of Peking. With this
                            point of view it is hard to agree. The masses of the people in China are
                            lacking in food, clothing, weapons, cohesion and leaders. Invading
                            forces would be obliged to come equipped to supply these missing
                            resources on a vast scale in order for their presence to generate
                            widespread uprising of the people, assuming “the masses” had the will to
                            revolt.</p>
                        <p>6. In the military sphere we know from studies made by “Blue Lion” and
                            other papers submitted by Embassy Taipei that the Chinese military
                            regime is so deficient in the elements necessary for a successful
                            invasion of a continent as to warrant grave skepticism on our part of
                            any <pb n="356" xml:id="pg_356" facs="0392"/>success. Probably the
                            greatest handicap to a successful landing on the Continent would be the
                            deficiency of air power. It is well-known that the Allied invasion of
                            Normandy in 1944 with the subsequent outrunning of the German forces in
                            Western Europe had the paramount advantage of complete control of the
                            air. In addition, of course, masses of artillery, tanks, guns, manpower
                            and supplies of all kinds enabled the Allies to create a juggernaut
                            which overran the Germans, and under the protection of our own
                            formidable air umbrella. Besides all the above, the French Resistance,
                            properly equipped, organized and instructed, played a most important
                            part (blowing bridges, railroad tracks, etc.).</p>
                        <p>7. The United States assistance to Chinese military and economic sectors
                            has been restricted to war materiel designed for defense and not for
                            offense. The Chinese Air Force has no long-range bombers. Their fighters
                            are modern but short-ranged. Their air-lift capacity is very limited,
                            and their supplies of bombs, shells and ammunition have been furnished
                            for defense rather than offense.</p>
                        <p>8. It is true that the Chinese Air Force demonstrated a marked
                            superiority over the ChiCom Air Force in the battle of 1958 for the
                            Offshore Islands, and this was due more to their tactical skill than to
                            their use of sidewinder missiles supplied by the United States Air
                            Force. On the other hand, one must assume that the ChiCom Air Force is
                            now equipped with later-type MIG fighters and would have learned in
                            these past 4-1/2 years to improve their own tactics. Thus, an air battle
                            over the coast of Mainland China would result in a battle of attrition
                            in which the Chinese Air Force would be gradually whittled down. The
                            ChiCom air bases withdrawn some distance from the coastline would now be
                            more difficult to attack by the Chinese Air Force.</p>
                        <p>9. While some 20 years have elapsed since the Allied major amphibious
                            landings of World War II and it may be presumed that the technique of
                            such operations now would be different, yet it still appears that the
                            sea-lift for troops, replacements, ammunition, etc., would still be
                            needed in this or any Mainland invasion. Here again the Chinese military
                            machine has but meager resources. Embassy Taipei has reported recently
                            on the numbers of landing craft of all types plus merchant shipping
                            under Chinese Government control plus stocks stored on Taiwan. It is at
                            once obvious that the scale of a major invasion of a continent requires
                            vastly more than now in the hands of the Generalissimo.</p>
                        <p>10. The Chinese Navy is woefully deficient in gunfire capacity to cover
                            the landing as well as to protect replacement convoys.</p>
                        <p>11. The latest estimate from Embassy Taipei would indicate a sea-lift of
                            about 32,000 troops. An air-lift of 5-10,000 may also be possible. In
                            each of these cases it should be realized that for a short haul across
                            the Strait of Formosa the Chinese could readily overload shipping and
                            aircraft beyond the standards used by the Western Allies in World War
                            II.</p>

                        <p>12. In the papers thus far produced on the subject of Chinese
                            capabilities very little mention is made of the ChiComs' reactions. We
                            do know from the defector [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source
                                text not declassified</hi>] that in the summer of 1962 there were
                            two schools of thought in ChiCom military circles. The first was to
                            crush the attempted invasion at the shoreline and the second was to
                            allow the invasion force to make some penetration inland in order to
                            destroy or capture the invaders plus all their accompanying
                            equipment.</p>
                        <p>13. On the other hand, it seems most unlikely that, were the invading
                            forces to make any significant progress inland, the ChiComs would not
                            resort to the normal offensive strategy of attacking the bases on Taiwan
                            from which these forces were supplied, or attacking the air fields used
                            by the Chinese Air Force.</p>
                        <p>14. This does not necessarily mean an invasion of Taiwan. The government
                            at Peking might be loath to undertake any operations against Taiwan
                            which would result in US intervention. Nevertheless, such a possibility
                            should not be overlooked and ChiCom bombing squadrons should be expected
                            to make attacks by day or night on these staging areas or air fields
                            whose precise locations are undoubtedly known to the Peking military
                            authorities.</p>
                        <p>15. Here the question arises of what the United States Government would
                            feel called upon to do. It might be the Government of Peking would
                            disclaim any intent to invade the island of Taiwan, but bombing of such
                            character would undoubtedly result in considerable damage to
                            installations on the island of Taiwan plus the people living there.
                            American personnel would not escape serious punishment. Casualties to
                            our own people would be expected to produce a sharp reaction in the
                            United States—not only on the part of the Government but of the people
                            and of the Congress. Retaliation on our part by our armed forces could
                            scarcely avoid intrusions over the Mainland territory of Communist
                            China. Such hostile action by United States forces would undoubtedly
                            produce a reaction on the part of the Government of Peking. Thus, open
                            warfare between the United States Government and the Government of
                            Peking would eventuate. Consequently there arises the very delicate
                            question as to whether such would not be the opening phase of World War
                            III—a disaster for the world.</p>
                        <p>16. From this estimate it will be seen that I myself am strongly opposed
                            to giving President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang
                                Kai-shek</persName> any leeway whatsoever in his attempt to
                            circumvent his Treaty with the United States.</p>
                        <p>a. I further believe that it is necessary that we take steps now to make
                            it clear to <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> that
                            we will have no part of this.</p>
                        <p>b. I believe we might properly make some public statements in the near
                            future that we do not intend to recede from our declared position that
                            we will defend Taiwan but we will not countenance aggression initiated
                                <pb n="358" xml:id="pg_358" facs="0394"/>by the Chinese Government
                            now on Taiwan. I believe such a step would be an acceptable method lying
                            between the (a) stern warning not to do it and given on a short notice
                            or (b) using US military forces to intervene once an invasion had been
                            started by the Gimo.</p>
                        <p>I consider it most inadvisable to allow the Generalissimo to have any
                            private way of conveying to the United States Government that he is
                            going to take any measures of an aggressive nature with or without our
                            sanction.</p>
                        <p>c. I disagree with the point of view held by President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> that Soviet Russia would
                            not intervene to sustain a Communist regime in China. I myself was US
                            Ambassador to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> when the
                            Sino-Soviet Treaty of 14 February 1950<note n="1" xml:id="d172fn1">Reference is to the treaty of friendship, alliance, and mutual
                                assistance signed at Moscow on that date. For text, see UNTS 226:5;
                                also printed in <hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy: Basic
                                    Documents, 1950-1955,</hi> pp. 2463-2465.</note> was signed; and
                            its Article I is highly pertinent. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> could not afford a different type of
                            government on Mainland China, even if only in the areas south of the
                            Yangtze River. While a change in the personalities of the governing
                            authorities in Peking might be welcomed in Moscow, a complete overthrow
                            of Communist domination would be intolerable—especially if the United
                            States shared therein.</p>
                        <p>d. I find it impossible to believe a Chinese invasion of the Mainland
                            could now occur without the whole world—friend and foe alike—blaming the
                            United States for allowing the Sino-American Defense Pact to be
                            violated. I see no way in which that Treaty can be circumvented; short
                            of its denunciation or public abrogation, the Treaty stands before our
                            Allies, all neutral nations, and all of the Communist bloc as a solemn
                            pledge of the United States. To condone or to camouflage the evasion of
                            its articles would impugn our good faith, our honor, and our
                            self-respect. Furthermore, we should be well aware of our inability to
                            reason with General <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang
                                Kai-shek</persName> in the 1944-49 period, when he lost the

                        <p>DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: I have read your letter of March fifteenth<note n="1" xml:id="d173fn1">
                                <persName>Chiang</persName>'s letter argued that growing unrest on
                                the mainland and the deepening rift between <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> created an unprecedented
                                opportunity and urged consultation on a plan to give his government
                                “adequate support for the deliverance of our compatriots from
                                despotic rule.” (Department of State, Presidential Correspondence:

                                Supplement.</note> with great interest. I appreciate your full and
                            frank expression of your views on problems of deep concern to both of
                            our countries. I know that you would want me to respond with equal
                            candor.</p>
                        <p>China occupies a special place in the hearts of the American people. No
                            news could give Americans greater joy than to learn that, after thirteen
                            long years of suffering, the people of mainland China have freed
                            themselves from Communist oppression. Our hopes for the early liberation
                            of the Chinese people, however, cannot be permitted to cloud our
                            judgment of what is possible or to lead us into ill-considered actions
                            that would not work, would end only in disaster for you and might
                            precipitate a situation that neither of us want.</p>
                        <p>Despite the arguments set forth so cogently in your letter, I do not
                            believe that we possess sufficient information to make firm judgments on
                            vital questions such as the will and ability of the Chinese people to
                            rise up successfully against their Communist masters. Also, I do not see
                            how, given the long and close association of our two Governments and the
                            Treaty and related agreements which bind us, the United States
                            Government could be absolved from responsibility for actions which your
                            Government might take against the Communist-held mainland.</p>
                        <p>Under these circumstances, the United States Government must exercise
                            care in concerting with your Government on a program of action against
                            the Chinese Communists. We can and will continue to work closely with
                            you in checking the expansion of Chinese Communist political and
                            diplomatic influence and in supporting the international position and
                            influence of the Republic of China. We can and will continue to <pb n="360" xml:id="pg_360" facs="0396"/>give you needed assistance in
                            your most important effort to create on Taiwan a model of dynamic

                        <p>It was in order to facilitate close consultations on the entire range of
                            problems of common concern to China and the United States that I

                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName>, whom I have known
                            for a long time, called on me today. He said that he had spent about 40
                            days in Taiwan and was extremely concerned over the attitudes that he
                            found there on the question of the return to the mainland. He said that
                            we should not underestimate or minimize the problem. He impliedly agreed
                            with my observations that an attempt could only result in disaster but
                            emphasized that the leadership on Taiwan is in an increasingly desperate
                            frame of mind and feels that it is “this year or never”, regardless of
                            the risks. He implied that we had not been sufficiently blunt in talking
                            with Taiwan and that, unless we were more blunt than in the past, they
                            may misinterpret our attitude.</p>
                        <p>In reply to his direct question as to my “personal view” as to what the
                            reaction of the United States Government would be in the event they were
                            to seek to mount an invasion of the mainland without concurrence of the
                            United States, I said that the reaction would be uniformly most
                            seriously adverse. I said that we had, in our treaty with the GRC,
                            undertaken very clear and definite obligations with respect to the
                            defense of Taiwan, and the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> had in
                            turn undertaken very definite obligations with respect to us. If the
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> disregarded its reciprocal
                            obligations it could not but call into question the validity of the
                            obligations we had undertaken. I had Colonel Hwang translate this so
                            that there would be no misunderstanding.</p>
                        <p>In reply to his direct question, I said that, in spite of the undoubted
                            economic difficulties Peking was having, we had no information whatever
                            which would indicate its hold on the mainland had weakened sufficiently
                            to give any hope whatever that a landing by the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> could be <pb n="362" xml:id="pg_362" facs="0398"/>successful. I pointed out that the first indication of the weakening
                            of Peking's hold would be the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            ability successfully to carry out extensive intelligence operations on
                            the mainland. He, as a soldier, well appreciated the importance of
                            intelligence and nothing that he had said, or other information that I
                            had, indicated any increased <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            capability in this regard. General <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> admitted that this was correct.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> also said that many
                            people and “scholars” in Taiwan were saying that the question of the
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> seeking to land on the mainland
                            was purely an “internal matter”. I said that this, of course, was also
                            exactly what I had heard from <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang
                                Ping-nan</persName> at Geneva for three years, and was the
                            consistent Peking line. I said that I could not see how Taiwan could
                            take this attitude without also reviewing whether it desired to maintain
                            its treaty relationship with the United States. Under our present
                            treaty, what affected the security of Taiwan affected the United States,
                            and for Taiwan to undertake offensive operations against the mainland
                            clearly involved the security of Taiwan. Apart from the attitude of the
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>, the security of Taiwan was of
                            great interest to the United States and we had invested heavily in its
                            maintenance.</p>
                        <p>In reply to General <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName>'s
                            question on the outlook for military aid this next year, I pointed out
                            the extreme resistance that aid was meeting in the Congress this year,

                                meeting in telegram 1608, April 18. He noted that the “list of US

                                    <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> was considerably

                                stated that since his own initial presentation had been “relatively
                                moderate,” he subsequently “spoke rather sharply” and “having

                                concerned three deportable individuals who wished to go to mainland

                            it does not want to see renewed conflict and US must stop interference
                            in internal affairs and withdraw all military personnel. Chinese

                            and foreign policies, to identify the major problems it faces, and to

                            possible, further ahead.</p>
                        <pb n="366" xml:id="pg_366" facs="0402"/>
                        <p>Conclusions</p>
                        <p>A. Communist China's domestic situation appears slightly improved from
                            its recent grievous state. To a considerable extent this improvement
                            reflects relatively moderate, pragmatic policies which have replaced the
                            excesses of the “leap forward” and commune programs. With good luck and
                            good management, the economy could within the next couple of years
                            resume a rapid rate of growth approaching that of the First Five-Year
                            Plan, though it is likely to fall short of this. A critical question
                            over the next five years will be whether the Chinese Communist
                            leadership will sustain a pragmatic course in the face of its strong
                            ideological compulsions. Unsound doctrinaire policies, bad weather, and
                            other unfavorable factors could combine to cause complete economic
                            stagnation. (Paras. 1-6, 11-17)</p>
                        <p>B. Though discontent will persist and could increase if the economic
                            situation deteriorates, we do not believe that dissidence will pose any
                            serious threat to the regime in the next two years. (Para. 10)</p>
                        <p>C. Communist China's economic difficulties and the drastic reduction of
                            Soviet cooperation have lessened the relative effectiveness of Communist
                            China's military establishment. Nevertheless, Peiping still has by far
                            the strongest Asian army, and this is sufficient to support the kind of
                            relatively cautious foreign policies Peiping has actually been
                            conducting or is likely to conduct during the next two years. It will
                            almost certainly not have a militarily significant nuclear weapons
                            system until well beyond this period.<note n="1" xml:id="d176fn1">This
                                question will be discussed in detail in <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> 13-2-63, “The Chinese Communist Advanced Weapons
                                Program”, (Top Secret) to be published soon. [Footnote in the source
                                text. The estimate under reference was published as SNIE 13-2-63,
                                “Communist China's Advanced Weapons Program,” July 24, 1963. A

                        <p>D. Peiping's dispute with Moscow springs from basic issues of
                            incompatible national and party interests, and the Chinese Communists
                            show no signs of relenting. Public polemics may be damped down on
                            occasion, but we do not believe a fundamental reconciliation will take
                            place. The Chinese will almost certainly continue to attempt to expand
                            their influence at Soviet expense in the underdeveloped countries and to
                            turn Communists throughout the world against <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> and his policies. A formal schism could occur
                            at any time, although the chances are reduced by each party's great
                            anxiety to avoid the onus of having split the world Communist movement.
                            (Paras. 24-30)</p>
                        <p>E. Communist China's foreign policy will probably continue generally
                            along current lines. Peiping will remain passionately anti-American and
                            will strive to weaken the US position, especially in east Asia, but is
                            unlikely knowingly to assume great risks. China's military force will
                                <pb n="367" xml:id="pg_367" facs="0403"/>probably not be used
                            overtly except in defense of its own borders or to assert territorial
                            claims against India. Subversion and covert support of local revolutions
                            will continue to be Peiping's mode of operation in southeast Asia and,
                            to a necessarily more limited degree, elsewhere in Asia and in Africa
                            and Latin America. (Paras. 31-40)</p>

                            problem of dealing with the ChiCom military problem than to the specific
                            Korean problem.</p>
                        <p>As I remember it, <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">General Taylor</persName>
                            said we should not permit ourselves to become engaged with the hordes of
                            China, that any military contest with Communist China should be nuclear;
                            your view was that our present strategy calls for the use of nuclears
                            against the ChiComs and, therefore, conventional capabilities in the Far
                            East, beyond counter-insurgency, have a low priority; and the President
                            said that just as in Europe we would use nuclears if there were no other
                            way of avoiding defeat, so would we in the Pacific.</p>
                        <p>To my mind, and as I understood the President to suggest, there is no
                            substantial difference in the grounds for policy toward the East or <pb n="368" xml:id="pg_368" facs="0404"/>toward the West, toward Russia
                            or toward China. If a policy of giving the President maximum options in
                            Europe makes sense, it would also seem to make sense in the Pacific. If
                            a policy of giving the other side time to make the decision to back down
                            makes sense in Cuba, I don't see why it doesn't make sense in Korea. If
                            a policy of getting our allies to reduce, over time, the conventional
                            imbalance in Europe makes sense, I don't see why a similar policy
                            doesn't make sense in the Pacific. The ChiComs non-nuclear power,
                            particularly her air power, is certainly vastly inferior to that of the
                            Warsaw Pact. We can't foretell the exact relationship between Peiping
                            and Moscow that will emerge, but to my mind it is equally doubtful, or
                            more doubtful, that the U.S.S.R. would stand aside while we defeated
                            China with nuclear weapons, than if we did so with non-nuclear weapons.
                            The more important point, however, is that the Soviets might have less
                            reason to restrain the Chinese in aggressive action if our only possible
                            response were a nuclear response which the circumstances might make
                            politically difficult for us and thus of dubious credibility.</p>

                            conference on May 22, 1963, a reporter noted that there had been
                            “considerable discussion in the Far East that <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> might be preparing to invade the
                            mainland of China” and asked how the U.S. Government would view such an
                            attempt. The President replied that the treaty relationship under the
                            Mutual Defense Treaty provided for “very close consultation between the
                            two governments before any such action would be taken.” He continued:
                            “As a practical matter, this of course does involve the United States,
                            and we have expressed our views to the Government of Formosa on the
                            matter.” (<hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the Presidents of the

                            Soviet Union were held in Moscow, July 15-25, 1963, leading to the
                            initialing on July 25 of a treaty banning nuclear weapons tests in the
                            atmosphere, in outer space, and under water. Under Secretary of State

                            occasions, especially in a July 15 conversation among <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>, British representative Lord

                            only, but consider that relatively small forces in hands of people like
                            ChiComs could be very dangerous to us all. Further believe even limited
                            test ban can and should be means to limit diffusion.</p>

                        <p>“A search of our records of the Test Ban Treaty negotiations in Moscow
                            fails to reveal any <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>

                            question of Chinese nuclear capacities came up in various <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> conversations. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> probed <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                            knowledge of Chinese capacities and its attitude toward them. He
                            expressed our concern regarding this matter and said he hoped that the
                            problem would be solved by eventual Chinese adherence to the Treaty or
                            by disarmament. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> was
                            obviously unwilling to talk at much length on the question and he tried

                        <p>“One of the reasons that the Chinese issue was raised with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> was <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>'s theory that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s interest in a test ban
                            treaty flowed from his desire to isolate Red China in the international

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> asked whether we
                            have any hard evidence that there were significant movements of Chinese
                            Communist troops anywhere along their borders. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CRS1">Cline</persName> responded that the answer
                            depended on the definition of the word “significant.” He then summarized
                            the hard evidence on troop activity contained in the <gloss target="#t_SNIE1">SNIE</gloss>. He described the logistic
                            improvements being made by the Chinese Communists along the Tibetan
                            border consisting primarily of work on local roads.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> asked whether it was
                            agreed that we could only speculate as to what effect the Sino-Soviet
                            split has had on military deployments on both sides. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CRS1">Cline</persName> agreed, adding that the <gloss target="#t_SNIE1">SNIE</gloss> stated that the Chinese probably
                            anticipated less political support from the Russians than they had
                            received in the past.</p>
                        <p>The President asked whether the recent military crisis in Korea should be
                            viewed as an isolated incident or as part of a broader military pattern.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CRS1">Cline</persName> replied that no one
                            could say with certainty. General Wheeler said that incidents similar to
                            those which took place this week in Korea occur every summer. Citing
                            officers with combat experience in Korea, he said at this time of year
                            for several years past there have been instances of line-crossing
                            activity. This year's incident is similar to last year's, although no
                            one can say positively that the recent ambushes are not part of a larger
                            pattern.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> then asked Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> to discuss the
                            actions which we were taking in anticipation of Chinese Communist
                            initiatives. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> had
                            earlier circulated copies of a memorandum to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> (copy attached).<note n="4" xml:id="d181fn4">

                            review policy contingencies in Laos because the President had been
                            thoroughly briefed on this subject earlier.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> said that Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_CJM1">Cabot</persName> in Warsaw would be
                            instructed to warn the Communist Chinese not to take actions which would
                            prompt immediate U.S. response in the area. He mentioned the two
                            recommendations in his paper; i.e. a request to the Department of
                            Defense to comment on U.S. military responses to possible renewal of
                            Chinese Communist militancy on the Indian front, and a request for a
                                <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> military evaluation of the
                            potential for increased infiltration into South Vietnam and of the means
                            available to deal with it within the territory of South Vietnam.<note n="5" xml:id="d181fn5">

                            An additional problem is how to reinforce against Communist subversion
                            inside India.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> also mentioned a draft
                            statement for the President to use at his press conference in response
                            to questions about Korea. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> noted that he wished to rework the statement before
                            discussing it with the President.</p>
                        <p>The President called attention to a press story in the Philadelphia
                            Inquirer which appeared to have been based on a statement made by a
                            State Department spokesman to the effect that we were anticipating
                            serious trouble with Communist China. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> responded by recalling the warning
                            the U.S. had given Communist China two days before the outbreak of the
                            Korean War. In his view, if our warning to the Chinese had been sent
                            earlier, the Korean War might not have taken place. Because the warning
                            reached Peiping only two days before the offensive began in Korea, the
                            Chinese were so fully committed to the attack that it was too late for
                            them to consider the warning.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> said the story the
                            President referred to raised the problem of how to deal with press
                            speculation. He said the State Department spokesman had not volunteered
                            the statement but had merely said that the reports which the reporter
                            had of Chinese Communist military activity were known to the Government
                            and were being studied. The reporter had written the story as if the
                            Department had confirmed the reports.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> referred to the
                            Special Estimate and called attention to the majority USIB view; i.e.
                            the possibility of Communist Chinese activity is greater than that
                            expressed by the State Department.</p>
                        <p>The President asked whether the Indian army was any better off this year
                            than it had been last year when the Communists attacked. General Wheeler
                            responded that the Indians were better off because of our military
                            assistance. He noted, however, that no Indian military force was in the
                                <gloss target="#t_NEFA1">NEFA</gloss>, so that if the Chinese
                            Communists chose to take this area, they could do so without military
                            opposition.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> concluded the
                            discussion by expressing his belief that we should maintain a state of
                            considerable alert during the next few weeks. He pointed out that the
                            Chinese Communists could cause grave trouble from a standing start; i.e.
                            without reinforcements, on several fronts at the same time. The military
                            capability on their frontiers is great. The troops in front of them are
                            very thin and totalitarian regimes can reverse their courses very
                            quickly. Thus, some Chinese initiative might suddenly reveal that the
                            Russians and the Chinese were back together again.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> added that although
                            the differences between the Russians and the Chinese are very great, he
                            did not think they were very deep or that a final break between the two
                            powers would occur.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> said he did not think
                            the two powers would break, but he believed that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would not back China in any
                            wild adventure. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would
                            not react if the Chinese got into a small <pb n="374" xml:id="pg_374" facs="0410"/>military fight, but if <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> landed on the Mainland, the Russians
                            would support the Chinese Communists fully.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said that during the
                            period ahead of us, we should not contemplate reductions in the
                            indigenous force levels of either Korea or Nationalist China. There was
                            no comment on this suggestion.</p>
                        <p>In response to the President's question, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said he was asking no action by the
                            President on the matters discussed today.<note n="6" xml:id="d181fn6">

                        <p>Mr. Murrow asked for Presidential approval of the way <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> is handling the Sino-Soviet split. He
                            said existing guidance forbade polemics and attempts to exacerbate
                            relations between Communist China and the Soviet Union. The Voice of
                            America is playing straight the comments on the split coming out of both
                            Peking and Moscow, but it does not attempt to exploit the difference.
                            The President agreed that this was the proper way to handle the current

                                that <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> forces should not be
                                reduced because, among other considerations, they represented a
                                strategic reserve “available for support of U.S. Objectives in the
                                Far East” or “meeting contingency military requirements.” He
                                requested <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s views on this
                                and on a <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> proposal of January
                                1963 supporting the possible use of <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> forces up to three divisions in Southeast Asia.
                                (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_DEF1">DEF</gloss> 12 US)</note> concerning
                            certain aspects of the employment of <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            forces. We believe that <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> forces
                            available as a strategic reserve of conventional force in the Far East
                            would contribute to the support of U.S. objectives of deterring Chinese
                            Communist aggression and under certain circumstances of countering such
                            aggression if it should occur. At the same time we do not agree with the
                            JCS recommendation that U.S. policy favor the principle of employment of
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> units in conflicts in Southeast
                            Asia, though as will be noted subsequently there is one set of
                            circumstances where such employment might be feasible.</p>
                        <p>It seems to me that we must be quite realistic in understanding that the
                            Nationalist Government of China would not commit its military forces
                            except as a part of a major engagement whose objective is the return of
                            that Government to full control on the mainland of China. Conversely,
                            the use of Nationalist Chinese forces in Southeast Asia, in the absence
                            of Chinese Communist forces in that area, would almost inevitably result
                            in the commitment of Chinese Communist forces to meet them. The
                            Nationalist Chinese forces are of great importance to the United States
                            in the event of a major Chinese Communist aggression, and I would think
                            that we would wish to be very cautious about reducing those forces
                            during the present period of uncertainty about Peiping's intentions
                            following their break with Moscow. In evaluating the role of Chinese
                            Nationalist forces, particularly ground forces, I also feel that we must
                            assess their capabilities in the most rigorous professional manner and
                            not be unduly influenced in this regard by mere hope or traditional
                            goodwill.</p>

                        <p>With respect to the strategic reserve concept, from the Chinese Communist
                            viewpoint, the existence of these <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            forces must be regarded as providing the United States and its allies
                            with a number of options, all of which the Chinese Communists would have
                            to take into account in planning aggressive action anywhere in Asia. The
                            Joint Chiefs' study points out that the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> forces keep large Communist forces tied down on the
                            mainland opposite Taiwan. The forces so tied down would presumably be
                            unavailable to support a major Chinese Communist aggression in Korea or
                            in Southeast Asia. Moreover, given the presence of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> strategic reserve force on Taiwan, one
                            can imagine that in the event of Chinese Communist aggressive action in
                            Korea or Southeast Asia, <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> feints
                            against various points along the mainland China coast might serve to
                            draw Chinese Communist forces off from their main point of attack or at
                            least to restrain the Chinese Communists from developing their attack to
                            major proportions which would require U.S. employment of nuclear
                            weapons.</p>
                        <p>However, the only situation in which, from a political point of view, we
                            can clearly visualize the actual introduction of <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> troops in Southeast Asian countries (or in the
                            territory of any other free Asian nation) would be in the case of
                            large-scale Chinese Communist aggression, as such aggression is defined
                            in the Chiefs' study. There are two reasons why, except in the case of
                            large-scale Chinese Communist attack, it would be infeasible to
                            introduce <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> forces into Southeast
                            Asia. The first is that the countries concerned would be strongly
                            opposed to the introduction of <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            forces. Second, the introduction of <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            forces would almost certainly provoke the introduction of Chinese
                            Communist forces. Consequently, while we support the concept of a <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> strategic reserve, we would not support
                            the establishment of a general policy of favoring the use of <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> forces in Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p>Conceivably, <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> troops might be used to
                            help meet a limited Chinese Communist action against Southeast Asian
                            countries, but this seems undesirable. If the limited Chinese Communist
                            attack were of a probing nature designed to test our reactions, or if
                            the attack could be adequately met by conventional U.S. and other allied
                            forces (SEATO and indigenous), <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            troops should not be introduced. The use of <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> troops could have an important effect on the Chinese
                            Communist estimate of our intentions. If no <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> troops were brought in, the Chinese Communists might
                            consider that our intention was only to stop their probe and drive the
                            Communist forces back behind existing borders. If <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> divisions were brought in, even if
                            initially in only limited numbers, the Chinese Communists might consider
                            that the ultimate intention was to reinforce and thence to try to drive
                            into mainland China. Peiping could believe that American forces would be
                            used only to achieve limited objectives whereas they would be more
                            likely to judge that <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> troops <pb n="377" xml:id="pg_377" facs="0413"/>would participate only as a
                            means of facilitating their return to power on the mainland. The Chinese
                            Communists would go all out to meet what they regarded as a serious
                            threat to their security. Consequently, the introduction of <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> divisions might transform what was
                            initially intended only as a limited Chinese Communist probing action
                            into a large-scale Chinese Communist aggression.</p>
                        <p>In all the spectrum of conflict which ranges below these upper levels of
                            intensity, it clearly would be infeasible to use <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> troops in Southeast Asia. And, it is in the lower part
                            of the spectrum—subversion, guerrilla warfare, clandestine introduction
                            of North Vietnamese cadres and troops—that the principal Communist
                            threat to Southeast Asia is manifested.</p>
                        <p>One point which ought to be noted in this consideration of <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> strategic reserve divisions is the
                            attitude of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> itself toward the
                            actual employment of these divisions. Chinese Nationalist interest in
                            such employment would probably vary directly with the opportunity
                            afforded them to confront the Chinese Communists. In any event, before
                            the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would make available divisions
                            of their better trained troops for use on the Asian mainland, they would
                            weigh very carefully the effect of such action on their own security and
                            aspirations.</p>
                        <p>Aside from these questions of the use of <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> forces, I was much interested in the Study's
                            presentation of the pros and cons on the use of nuclear weapons at the
                            outset of large-scale Chinese Communist aggression. It seemed to us that
                                <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss>'s views, as set forth in
                            the study on pages 8 and 9,<note n="2" xml:id="d182fn2">The quotation of
                                    <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss>'s views, which
                                occurs in an annex to the study headed “Discussion,” reads: “I will
                                not comment on the political aspects that militate against making
                                such a critical assumption. However, from purely a military point of
                                view, the resulting inflexibility evolving from such a concept is
                                one which causes me great concern. Should such a concept result in a
                                force incapable of conducting successful operations against ChiCom
                                aggression without resort to the use of nuclear weapons, we would
                                indeed have created conditions which would impose a degree of
                                rigidity in our military forces which is undesirable and
                                unwarranted.”</note> were particularly pertinent. Politically and
                            psychologically it will become even more important after a Chinese
                            Communist nuclear detonation, to have adequate U.S. conventional
                            capability in the Pacific so that free Asian nations will believe that
                            we can assist in defending them against at least limited Chinese
                            Communist attack without necessarily involving them in nuclear war.</p>

                            matters in order that there may be ample opportunity for mutual

                            August 5 tripartite test ban treaty goes against aspirations people of
                            world because it can be used by nuclear powers consolidate their nuclear
                            monopoly. It legalizes continued manufacture, transportation,
                            underground testing and use of weapons by US while binding hands of
                            peace-loving countries, denying them adequate means protect selves
                            against nuclear threat. Treaty thereby actually increases hazard of
                            nuclear war and is fraud menacing world peace. Asked how a few nuclear

                            people of whole world be ignored and a few nuclear powers be permitted
                            monopolize everything. Without participation China no major questions in
                            international affairs can be settled in our times. Said President

                            carrying on of nuclear race. If US sincere in wanting take first step,
                            should first remove nuclear threat it now possesses by dismantling all
                            overseas bases and reaching an accord establishing nuclear-free zones.

                            its nuclear threat to China and the Far East. This threat much felt in
                            China and entire Far East. Spoke of Guam fortifications, units with

                            Said as for missing servicemen in Korea, all such matters whether

                            this was impossible without verification. We had been negotiating on
                            this point at length. Our President's speech attempted to contribute

                            to test ban treaty as “dirty fraud.” Accused US of backing <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> acts on mainland, saying recently

                                <persName>Chiang</persName> would do no good. In June alone, ChiCom
                            wiped out six commando groups and shot down P2V. Said we were held

                            because we ourselves aware of this responsibility that I felt it

                            of amenities, General <persName corresp="#p_CC2">Chiang
                                Ching-kuo</persName> said that, although the Government of the
                            Republic of China (<gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>) understood the
                            reasons why the United States had signed the nuclear test ban treaty and
                            the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> shared the U.S. desire to ease
                            world tensions and preserve world peace, the treaty alone would not
                            solve all the problems. The <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> is
                            encouraged by President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>'s
                            public acknowledgement of the potential threat of continued Chinese
                            Communist growth; but, <persName>Chiang</persName> emphasized, the
                            Chinese Communist regime at the present time is weaker than it has ever
                            been since its 1949 takeover of the China mainland. On the assumption
                            that the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. will maintain the status quo in their
                            mutual relations, the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> feels that now
                            is the time for the U.S. and the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> to
                            establish a formula aimed at solving the problem of the China mainland
                            without triggering a major war. The <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            is prepared to assume full political responsibility for such action with
                            U.S. support. President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang
                                Kai-shek</persName> is positive that if the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> acts now, the Soviet Union will not go to the aid of
                            the Chinese Communists. Time is the key element, however, since new
                            factors could change the situation in the future. According to <persName corresp="#p_CC2">Chiang Ching-kuo</persName>, it is important that
                            the U.S. and the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> take joint action
                            immediately to enhance the difficulties now facing the Chinese
                            Communists and make it impossible for them to consolidate their
                            position. <persName corresp="#p_CC2">Chiang Ching-kuo</persName>
                            re-emphasized that the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> recognizes
                            the leading role of the United States and accepts the assumption that no
                            action will be taken which would risk war. The <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> is willing to discuss ways and means to weaken the
                            Chinese Communist regime and eventually overthrow it and feels that the
                            solution to the problem must be more political than military.
                                <persName>Chiang</persName>'s definition of political devices
                            included political warfare, psychological warfare, diplomatic action and
                            paramilitary operations such as maritime raids on the coast and airdrops
                            of paramilitary teams. The <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> plans for
                            the maritime raids and airdrops were to escalate from small and medium
                            teams to large teams in three stages, six months apart. <persName corresp="#p_CC2">Chiang Ching-kuo</persName> claimed that the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> has located missile sites and atomic
                            installations on the China mainland and desires to work with the United
                            States on ways and means to remove these and restrain their expansion.
                                <persName>Chiang</persName> promised to discuss details of the ways
                            and means to achieve this goal on other levels and reiterated that the
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would assume full political
                            responsibility for this action, expecting only transportation and
                            technical assistance from the United States. In conclusion,
                                <persName>Chiang</persName> repeated the contention that the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> is not planning a large scale attack on
                            the China <pb n="385" xml:id="pg_385" facs="0421"/>mainland and that the
                            Chinese Communists must not be permitted to solve their present
                            difficulties to become an even greater menace in the future.</p>
                        <p>In reply, Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> told <persName>Chiang</persName>
                            that the United States places a high priority on measures to weaken the
                            Chinese Communist regime, particularly its nuclear growth, and assured
                            him that the U.S. Government would examine most carefully any
                            possibilities advanced. Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> stressed the
                            United States Government's aversion to triggering a major conflict and
                            expressed the view that the split between the Soviet Union and Communist
                            China would probably widen unless extreme forces of great magnitude
                            drove them back together again. He said that one example of such a force
                            would be any major attack against the China mainland in which the United
                            States would be a dominant factor. Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName>
                            emphasized that the moment when major action against the mainland can be
                            taken without danger of Soviet intervention is not yet here and may
                            never arrive.<note n="3" xml:id="d185fn3">The words “when major” and
                                “danger of” appear in <persName>Bundy</persName>'s handwriting on
                                the source text.</note> In view of the lack of success of the small
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> operations of the past two and
                            three years, Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> felt there was a question of
                            whether larger operations would be productive and said the U.S. and the
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> must work together on the
                            problem. In Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName>'s opinion, any action against
                            the China mainland should depend on three factors: (1) a sound
                            intelligence estimate of Chinese Communist strength and capabilities;
                            (2) the degree of political usefulness of such operations; and (3) the
                            hazards and repercussions of failure to the U.S. and <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>. In passing, Mr.
                                <persName>Bundy</persName> mentioned the U.S. admiration of the
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>'s accomplishments in its social
                            and economic growth and assured <persName>Chiang</persName> that the
                            success and effectiveness of such growth is of great interest to the
                            United States Government. (End of summary)</p>

                                action by guerrilla airdrops and commando raids which would “ignite
                                an explosion on the Chinese mainland” and stating that U.S.

                        <p>General <persName>Chiang</persName> then told the President:</p>
                        <p>—that the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> wants additional aircraft
                            (five C-130's) and landing craft to conduct commando raids, in units of
                            up to 500 men, against the China mainland,</p>
                        <p>—that the 28 landings conducted since last October disrupted the Chinese
                            Communists to some extent, and more and larger raids would cause
                            commensurately greater disruption,</p>
                        <p>—that President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName>'s idea is to
                            seize one or more of the provinces south of the Yangtze when the time is
                            ripe,</p>
                        <p>—that President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> believes the
                            Chinese Communists must be denied a respite to overcome their present
                            serious difficulties.</p>
                        <p>The President responded:</p>
                        <p>—that we lack sufficient hard intelligence on conditions on the
                            mainland,</p>
                        <pb n="387" xml:id="pg_387" facs="0423"/>
                        <p>—that we do not wish to become involved in military operations where our
                            role would inevitably become known and which would end in failure,</p>
                        <p>—that we had one bad experience in Cuba where operations had been based
                            more on hope than on a realistic appraisal of the situation,</p>
                        <p>—that we both agree that we wish to weaken and, if possible, to destroy
                            Communist China, but undertaking actions which failed would result in a
                            setback for the cause of freedom everywhere,</p>
                        <p>—that we would carefully study the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>'s
                            proposals for use of additional ships and planes,</p>
                        <p>—that United States officials would work closely with <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> officials to develop detailed
                            intelligence so that any action would fit the actual situation. <hi rend="italic">End Summary</hi>.</p>
                        <p>1. General <persName>Chiang</persName> opened the substantive part of the
                            conversation by presenting to the President a letter from President
                                <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName>. After reading
                            the letter, the President asked <persName>Chiang</persName> what he felt
                            were the military prospects for intensified <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> raids on the Chinese mainland, such as the letter was
                            suggesting, in view of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            experience with small scale raids in the recent past. The President
                            asked what was the basis for the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            belief that airdrop operations of 100 to 300 men and sea-borne landings
                            of 300 to 500 men would be successful.</p>
                        <p>2. General <persName>Chiang</persName> replied that President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> had asked him to present the
                            following views:</p>
                        <p>a. The signing of the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty is a diplomatic
                            victory for the United States which will help to preserve world peace.
                            (President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> then expressed
                            appreciation for the signing by the Republic of China of the
                            Treaty.)</p>
                        <p>b. The Sino-Soviet dispute is a favorable development because, within the
                            premises of maintenance of the status quo and the preservation of peace,
                            it gives us a chance to use the forces now available to us to weaken the
                            Chinese Communists.</p>
                        <p>c. The Sino-Soviet dispute is primarily a personal one between <persName corresp="#p_MTMZ1">Mao</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. Thus, the dispute could continue to worsen
                            or there could be a 180-degree change.</p>
                        <p>d. President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> greatly admires
                            President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>'s foresight in
                            predicting in a recent speech that by 1970 the Chinese Communists could
                            become a much greater menace.<note n="2" xml:id="d186fn2">Reference is
                                to <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>'s August 1 press
                                conference; see <ref target="#d183fn6">footnote 6, Document
                                    183</ref>.</note> President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> believes that the Chinese Communists must not be
                            allowed to recover from their present difficulties but that advantage
                            should be taken of the present situation to harass and disrupt them, to
                            weaken them so that it will be possible to launch a successful
                            counterattack sometime in the future.</p>
                        <p>3. The President asked <persName>Chiang</persName> what weight he gave to
                            historical and geographic factors in the Sino-Soviet dispute, noting his
                            own feeling that the geographic factors had considerable importance.
                                <persName>Chiang</persName> replied that while geography was
                            important, in the Orient personality was a more <pb n="388" xml:id="pg_388" facs="0424"/>important factor. This was especially
                            true of the Communist party on the mainland.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName>Chiang</persName> said that President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> feels that the United States and
                            the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> should get together to take
                            advantage of the present situation. Fully aware of the peace policy of
                            the United States, President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> feels that this is not the time for large-scale
                            military operations against the mainland. But if lesser attacks are not
                            made against the mainland, if the Chinese Communists are left in peace
                            to overcome their present serious difficulties, if means are not found
                            to disrupt, disturb and disorganize them, the Chinese Communists will be
                            able to develop into a far greater international menace than they have
                            been in the past. Even though Soviet military aid has been discontinued,
                            the Chinese Communists will be able to consolidate. While political and
                            psychological warfare is important, it will not be effective unless
                            military measures are carried on simultaneously. The <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> envisages an augmented program of
                            attacks by airdrop operations and seaborne commando landings, but not a
                            large-scale invasion.</p>
                        <p>5. President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> inquired
                            about the degree of success of the guerrilla raids carried out in the
                            recent past, and asked for details concerning the number of raids and
                            percentage of casualties involved.</p>
                        <p><persName>Chiang</persName> replied that as military operations these
                            raids had not seen much success, but from the point of view of their
                            disruptive effect on the Chinese Communists, there had been much better
                            results. Since last October, 28 raids had been carried out, involving
                            teams ranging from six to 28 men. Most of the raiders were recent
                            refugees from the areas attacked. Half of four teams were able to return
                            to Taiwan. All other personnel became casualties. This meant a casualty
                            rate of 85 percent. The significance of these raids lies not in the
                            percentage of casualties but rather in the disruptive effect on the
                            Chinese Communists, as demonstrated by Chinese Communist broadcasts
                            themselves. For example, on July 28 of this year, a ten-man team was
                            landed and suffered 100 percent casualties. But according to Chinese
                            Communist radio broadcasts, 3,000 troops were mobilized to deal with the
                            team and 205 officers and men were later rewarded for their part in the
                            operations against the raiders. Similarly, according to the Chinese
                            Communist radio, 1,500 <gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss> troops fought
                            for three days to deal with a team which landed in Chekiang June 27.</p>
                        <p>These examples illustrate that, although most of the raiders may be
                            casualties, the raids achieve their purposes: i.e., to cause trouble on
                            the mainland, to raise the morale of the people, who hope for
                            liberation, and to upset the organization of the army. The ability of
                            the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> to carry out these raids,
                            however, is hindered by lack of transport and other factors.</p>
                        <p>6. The President asked what the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> had
                            in mind with regard to airdrops.</p>
                        <pb n="389" xml:id="pg_389" facs="0425"/>
                        <p><persName>Chiang</persName> replied that the numbers involved would
                            range from 20 to 100 or more depending upon the situation. Such
                            operations would not lead to a world war, but would serve to keep the
                            Chinese Communists on the defensive. Also, atomic research and
                            development installations and missile emplacements might be likely
                            targets for airborne raids. The purpose of these operations would be to
                            weaken the strength of the Chinese Communists progressively over the
                            next 12 to 18 months, to see what the result would be. President
                                <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName>'s idea is to proceed to
                            establish a foothold on the continent, when the time is ripe, through
                            the occupation of one or more provinces south of the Yangtze River.</p>
                        <p>The frequency and size of the airdrops would depend upon the situation,
                            the target, and upon joint discussions with your officials. The size of
                            the teams might range from 50 to 300 men. Both sides would have to study
                            this.</p>
                        <p>7. The President asked what <persName>Chiang</persName> thought would be
                            the result of such airdrops.</p>
                        <p><persName>Chiang</persName> replied that likely targets would be in more
                            inaccessible areas where communications were poor, where there were
                            relatively few garrison troops, and where unrest was more pronounced. If
                            200 to 300 men were dropped, they might be able to seize a county, in
                            which case the people would be likely to rally around them.</p>
                        <p>8. The President asked what information had been gathered from the recent
                            landings or from intelligence sources which led the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> to believe that the people would
                            support such operations or that there would be defections in the Chinese
                            Communist army.</p>
                        <p><persName>Chiang</persName> replied that the overall picture on the
                            mainland was one of growing unrest. Raiding operations would be carried
                            out in areas where this unrest was marked; for example, slave labor
                            camps would be ideal targets.</p>
                        <p>9. The President asked concerning the nature of <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> intelligence contacts on the mainland.</p>
                        <p><persName>Chiang</persName> replied that the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> had many intelligence sources. In July there had been a
                            revolt of slave laborers in Chung-shan County, Kwangtung province. The
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> had dispatched a team of ten men
                            to stimulate revolt there, but the timing had been poor and too few were
                            involved.</p>
                        <p>10. The President asked how many intelligence agents the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> had on the mainland.</p>
                        <p>[<hi rend="italic">1-1/2 lines of source text not declassified</hi>] The
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> depends to a considerable extent
                            on persons travelling to and from the mainland and on clandestine
                            correspondence for intelligence.</p>
                        <p>11. The President emphasized that the United States felt there was a
                            particular lack of hard intelligence from the China mainland. United
                            States actions in Cuba, for example, had suffered for lack of hard
                            intelligence. <pb n="390" xml:id="pg_390" facs="0426"/>We feel that
                            there is insufficient detailed and reliable intelligence from the China
                            mainland. If the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> has such
                            intelligence, the President hoped that it would be made available to
                            us.</p>
                        <p><persName>Chiang</persName> replied that, on this point, the President
                            should understand a special characteristic of the Chinese people. The
                            latter want to be rid of the Communists, but without anyone to lead and
                            to organize them, they are reluctant to act. Throughout Chinese history,
                            troops have hesitated to take action to revolt unless there were
                            assurances of an external source of help. The same consideration applies
                            to the Chinese people. The most important thing is not to allow the
                            Chinese Communists to consolidate and to have peace and quiet over the
                            next year. To let them alone for the coming year would be to permit them
                            to survive this critical period and to advance to greater strength. What
                            methods are to be used to prevent this consolidation is another matter,
                            one which the United States and the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            should discuss.</p>
                        <p>12. The President agreed that under the Communist control apparatus the
                            people have no means to express their dissatisfaction. But it is an
                            extremely serious matter for the United States to become involved in
                            support of the operations suggested by General
                                <persName>Chiang</persName>, particularly in view of the fact that
                            the United States part would inevitably become public knowledge. There
                            is no doubt that it is to our common advantage to weaken the Chinese
                            Communists, but we do not want to become involved in operations which
                            could be regarded as attacks on the mainland and which would fail. Thus,
                            detailed and accurate intelligence is extremely important. Our
                            intelligence people feel that there is a considerable lack of such
                            intelligence. We need to know definitely the extent of unrest on the
                            mainland and, for example, whether or not major officials are likely to
                            defect. The United States is not sure that the operations can be
                            successful until the whole mainland is ready for revolt.</p>
                        <p>13. <persName>Chiang</persName> stated that the question is one of how to
                            deny the Chinese Communists a period of peace and quiet which would
                            enable them to survive their present difficult situation. In this
                            regard, aside from political and psychological warfare, it is important
                            to step up raids by air and sea.</p>
                        <p>14. The President observed that 28 small-scale raids were not very
                            significant. It did not appear that these raids had disrupted the
                            mainland regime in any large degree.</p>
                        <p><persName>Chiang</persName> replied that the need now was to increase
                            the size of the raids, and that the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            needed more transport and technical help to do this. The goal of these
                            larger raids would be to multiply the disruption which had already been
                            caused. Since the Chinese Communists had been obliged to use 3,000 men
                            to deal with a small raid, more and larger raids would force them to use
                            greater forces, and would cause commensurately greater disruption.</p>
                        <pb n="391" xml:id="pg_391" facs="0427"/>
                        <p>15. The President asked what the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            wanted over the next 12 months in this regard.</p>
                        <p><persName>Chiang</persName> replied that over the next 12 to 18 months
                            the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would need to use the four
                            C-123's which it now has, but is not using, and an additional five
                            C-130's. It would also need additional landing craft. If agreement could
                            be reached on principle, details can be determined at the working
                            level.</p>
                        <p>16. The President noted that he felt the Chinese Communists pose a
                            tremendous danger to world peace, and that the United States is willing
                            to do any reasonable thing which would weaken their power. Our concern
                            is that our policy should be determined by reality and not by our hopes
                            or by our optimism. Thus, we feel that we should concentrate on
                            improvement in the intelligence gathering field. With better
                            intelligence and more facts, we can be more sure that our actions suit
                            the situation. The small raids which have been carried out, for example,
                            would appear to have been useful in teaching us a lesson concerning the
                            feasibility of such operations. The sacrifice made by the many brave men
                            who took part shows that the Chinese Communists still exercise effective
                            control on the mainland.</p>
                        <p>For our part, we shall study carefully the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> proposal for use of additional ships and planes. But
                            such a study will depend upon more intelligence from the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>. We would request that the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> make sure that its plans are in fact
                            realistic. The United States suffered a setback in the Cuban affair,
                            because of insufficient intelligence, a setback we would not want to
                            repeat.</p>
                        <p><persName>Chiang</persName> replied that he hoped the President would
                            authorize United States organizations to go into details on the requests
                            made during this visit, and that planning could continue after
                                <persName>Chiang</persName>'s return to Taiwan. President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> feels that efforts must be
                            coordinated. The Chinese Communists are like a starving tiger. The tiger
                            should be killed now, when he is weak, and before he has a chance to
                            regain his strength.</p>
                        <p>17. The President asked if <persName>Chiang</persName> thought it would
                            be possible to send 300 to 500 men by air to such distant Chinese
                            Communist atomic installations as that at Pao-t'ou, and whether it was
                            not likely that the planes involved would be shot down.</p>
                        <p><persName>Chiang</persName> replied that this had been discussed [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>]
                            yesterday and that [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text
                                not declassified</hi>] such an operation was feasible.</p>
                        <p>18. President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> stated that
                            the United States agreed that the Chinese Communist regime should be
                            weakened, and even destroyed, if that were possible. The <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> wishes to return to its home, and we
                            wish to ensure peace in the world. But we must be realistic. If
                            operations which failed were to be undertaken, then we would be in a
                            worse position than before. An example of this took place in 1961 in
                            Cuba when the operations <pb n="392" xml:id="pg_392" facs="0428"/>there
                            were based more on hope than on realistic appraisals. We must be
                            cold-blooded in our assessments. The United States cannot be involved in
                            losing operations. If four to six divisions were put ashore on the China
                            mainland and were defeated, this would be a setback for the cause of
                            freedom everywhere.</p>
                        <p>The President then summarized the United States position: the need now
                            was for better intelligence, more detailed information about conditions
                            on the China mainland, so that we might be assured that whatever action
                            is undertaken would fit the actual situation. He promised that the
                            United States would work closely with Chinese officials for these
                            ends.</p>
                        <p>19. The meeting concluded with the usual courtesies and an exchange of
                            gifts. <persName>Chiang</persName> presented the President with a
                            Chinese translation of his Inaugural Address and a copy of a Chinese
                            translation of his book “Profiles in Courage.” The President presented
                                <persName>Chiang</persName> with an autographed photograph of
                            himself.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_CJM1">Cabot</persName> commented and sent
                                recommendations for the next meeting in telegram 516, September 12.
                                He commented that in view of the Sino-Soviet rift, the Department
                                was presumably considering whether a “more conciliatory tone on our
                                part in talks might pay off.” He stated that he saw “no signs
                                whatever as yet it would”, but he thought the Department “should
                                study situation in light its overall knowledge to judge whether any
                                change in atmospherics of the talks would be worthwhile experiment.”
                                (Ibid.) He sent a detailed, apparently verbatim report of the
                                meeting in airgram A-235, September 14. (Ibid.)</note> Two hours 35

                        <p>(1) I opened with substance paragraphs 1, 2, and 3 reference telegram on
                            deportees, claims against shipping companies, and Howden,<note n="3" xml:id="d187fn3">Paragraph 1 concerned arrangements for the return
                                of six deportees. Paragraph 2 stated that discussions were to take
                                place in Hong Kong between the parties involved in one of the
                                shipping incidents raised at the previous meeting. Paragraph 3
                                instructed <persName corresp="#p_CJM1">Cabot</persName> to request
                                information concerning Robert Howden, reported by a French
                                journalist to be an American in prison in China.</note>
                            <pb n="393" xml:id="pg_393" facs="0429"/>adding to paragraph 3 that we
                            still hoping for release other imprisoned Americans in accordance with
                            agreed announcement. Said I mentioned this particularly in light
                            newspaper reports Bishop Walsh ill. Said did not need tell <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> what painful impression would be
                            caused in US if Bishop Walsh should die in Chinese jail. Continued with
                            substance paragraphs 4 and 5 with some embellishment and handed
                                <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> copy of Documents on
                            Disarmament 1961.<note n="4" xml:id="d187fn4">Paragraph 4 instructed

                                to discrepancies in Chinese statements on disarmament. Paragraph 5
                                instructed him to call attention to various U.S. statements and
                                suggested that he give <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName>
                                a copy of <hi rend="italic">Documents on Disarmament, 1961</hi>; it
                                stated that the Department did not intend to answer <persName corresp="#p_CEZE1">Chou</persName>'s letter or comment further
                                on the agreed announcement <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> had proposed at the August 7 meeting (see <ref target="#d183">Document 183</ref>), since it believed the
                                Chinese might be hoping for an outright U.S. rejection of their
                                proposals used to justify their own nuclear tests.</note> Concluded
                            opening statement with substance paragraph 7 on our defense commitments
                            in area.</p>
                        <p>(2) <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> said he had listened
                            with regret because he thought after more than month of consideration my
                            government would have reacted favorably to <persName corresp="#p_CEZE1">Chou</persName>'s August 2 letter and to draft agreed announcement.
                            Said my statement showed once more we not sincerely interested
                            preventing nuclear war. <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName>
                            said his government position clear and consistent, always standing for
                            general disarmament and complete ban nuclear weapons. Gave lengthy
                            review in most general terms of his government's “unremitting efforts
                            for general disarmament and destruction nuclear weapons”. <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> said his government convinced
                            mankind will destroy nuclear weapons and nuclear weapons will not
                            destroy mankind. Said his government had put forth both general
                            objectives and concrete measures to reach general disarmament and
                            destruction nuclear weapons. Said there was sharp contrast between his
                            proposal and tripartite treaty which “divorced discontinuance of nuclear
                            tests from total banning nuclear weapons”. Alleged only by adopting
                            Chinese proposal could real progress be made. Referred to ChiCom call
                            for conference heads of all nations of world and said facts have shown
                            that without participation China no major international question can be
                            settled. Era when handful of big powers take all in their hands is
                            passed. Said proposal for nuclear-free zone in accord with overwhelming
                            desire people of Asia. Enumerated various provisions called for in
                                <persName corresp="#p_CEZE1">Chou</persName> letter and draft
                            announcement. Said it was high time we took action extricate ourselves
                            from difficult situation posed by fact people of countries where we had
                            military bases opposed our presence. <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> said believed agreement on draft presented last
                            meeting would facilitate smooth settlement other disputes between China
                            and US. Said draft was only statement of principle not containing any
                            complicated technical questions and therefore agreement should be
                            reached in a relatively short time. Said once agreement in principle
                            reached, technical questions such as verification and <pb n="394" xml:id="pg_394" facs="0430"/>control could be settled through
                            further negotiations between the two sides.</p>
                        <p>Said we had even got “<persName>Chiang</persName> clique” sign tripartite
                                treaty.<note n="5" xml:id="d187fn5">The Republic of China signed the
                                treaty on August 23.</note> This showed hostility to his country and
                            was new plot to create two Chinas. Said nuclear fraud of <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> could not succeed. Said he was calling
                            on me to “reconsider” their proposal but immediately started his
                            sentence over saying “give careful consideration” to proposal for it was
                            major question which we called on to discuss seriously in this meeting.
                            Invited constructive views on it.</p>
                        <p>(3) <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> said report by French
                            correspondent of fifth American allegedly imprisoned was complete
                            fabrication.</p>
                        <p>(4) I said disarmament was very complicated subject on which we have
                            negotiated in Geneva for very long time. This suggests <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> incorrect in saying we not
                            interested in elimination threat nuclear war. Fact we have been able
                            sign treaty with <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> is step forward and at least 88 nations
                            have signed treaty. Said we had given detailed documents on our position
                            re disarmament while Chinese proposal was vague and certainly not clear
                            to us. Said his side had repeatedly talked of anxiety to reach general
                            disarmament and prohibition nuclear weapons—why then did they not sign
                            test ban treaty which is important step in that direction. Reminded him
                            he had said number of nations had expressed sympathy for his side's
                            proposals and inquired which these were. Said he had mentioned so-called
                            Vietnam Democratic Republic support. Considering blatant intervention
                            that regime in Laos and South Vietnam, I did not think this was good
                            endorsement for proposals. Said while we shared to considerable extent
                            basic objectives as he had described them in connection his side's
                            proposals, we were far from convinced deeds matched words his side and
                            certain care was essential in any scheme for disarmament to make sure
                            there was no cheating.</p>
                        <p>(5) I continued with substance paragraph 9 reftel re firmness without
                                hostility<note n="6" xml:id="d187fn6">Paragraph 9 instructed
                                    <persName corresp="#p_CJM1">Cabot</persName> that the United

                                hostility and was prepared to “wait patiently until <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName>'s side is willing to
                                cooperate in lessening tensions.”</note> and gave answer redraft
                            agreed announcement as instructed paragraph 5 (C).<note n="7" xml:id="d187fn7">Paragraph 5 (C) summarized U.S. criteria concerning

                                set forth on October 29 in Committee I of the U.N. General Assembly
                                by Charles C. Stelle, see Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, November 18, 1963, pp. 797-798.</note>

                        <p>(6) <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> continued with long
                            dissertation peaceful intent his Government and <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> obstruction to disarmament efforts. Listed testing and
                            other activities by <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> which he thought
                            inconsistent with spirit recently signed treaty. Again asked for serious
                            consideration draft <pb n="395" xml:id="pg_395" facs="0431"/>agreed
                            announcement and returned to theme of convocation of Heads of Nations
                            for conference on total disarmament. Said that proposal had been
                            endorsed by many countries including North Korea, North Vietnam,
                            Cambodia, Burma, Indonesia, Laos, Albania, Ethiopia and Sierra Leone.
                            Read at length endorsements by Prince Sihanouk, Emperor Haile Selassie,
                            and Bertrand Russell, and numerous editorials from newspapers (some of
                            which I recognized as being pro-Commie). Said fact so many countries had
                            signed tripartite treaty shows US authorities have abused innocent
                            peaceful wishes of people of these countries in order serve selfish
                            interest USG and was continuance policy of satellization. Quoted <hi rend="italic">Time</hi> magazine saying, “effect of treaty
                            negligible.”</p>
                        <p>(7) I expressed regret <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> had
                            not spelled out more fully what was meant by his side's proposals and
                            recalled we had not received comments from their side on our explicit
                            and detailed positions re disarmament which earlier passed him.</p>
                        <p>Reminded <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> actions we had
                            taken since tripartite treaty had been in accord with that treaty and we
                            had no intention accept moratoria as we did before and find ourselves
                            surprised by nuclear testing. Asked <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> whether his side when able would test in air and
                            under sea, and whether reports true his side working hard as it could to
                            get nuclear power at same time talking nuclear disarmament.</p>
                        <p>(8) <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> simply replied by saying
                            mankind confronted with serious nuclear threat and specifically his
                            country now faced with nuclear threat coming from US. Therefore
                            necessary put forward draft agreed announcement which is not vague but
                            specific, practical and feasible and formed useful basis for
                            negotiations.</p>
                        <p>Next meeting November 13.</p>
                        <p>Before talk I told correspondents at entrance that no significance should
                            be read into presence of photographers who in view of precedents were
                            briefly admitted by mutual consent. After talk I said to correspondents
                            that no inference should be drawn from length of talk. This was because
                            there seemed to be impression among correspondents that something
                            important was impending. At end of talk one correspondent asked whether
                            atmosphere was cordial and I, knowing correspondent was well aware that
                                <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> and I are very blunt
                            with each other, said ironically that atmosphere was always cordial.</p>

                        <p>The following summarizes certain discussions with General <persName corresp="#p_CC2">Chiang Ching-kuo</persName> during the General's
                            visit to Washington.</p>
                        <p>The present moment is an important one in world history particularly in
                            relation to the future course of events in the Far East and in Communist
                            China. In order to weaken the Chinese Communist regime, it is desirable
                            for the Government of the Republic of China and the United States to
                            consult closely and carry out such actions as we mutually agree will
                            serve this end.</p>
                        <p>Both governments wish to avoid action which would run the risk of
                            precipitating a world conflict or action which, by failure or otherwise,
                            would be detrimental to their joint interests. [<hi rend="italic">2

                        <p>There was discussion of a proposal [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of

                            effective operations. This group would develop plans and programs for
                            consideration by both sides to improve capabilities to hurt the Chinese
                            Communist regime. It was agreed that this subject would be discussed
                            further [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>]. In general the plans and programs might
                            cover:</p>
                        <p>1. The Political Path to Mainland Resistance—It is important to develop
                            ways and means to win the political allegiance of individuals on the
                            mainland and to properly indoctrinate agents who were sent there.
                            President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName>'s “Ten Pledges to
                            the Mainland People” might well form a basis for the political
                            program.</p>
                        <p>2. Penetration and Subversion—Equally important is the weakening of the
                            Chinese Communist control apparatus by the recruitment and subversion of
                            individuals in the government, the Party, and the Communist Army.</p>
                        <p>3. Strategic Targets—Study would be given to paramilitary sabotage
                            operations directed at key Chinese Communist military and industrial
                            installations.</p>
                        <p>The United States will provide adequate support for use when necessary in
                            mutually agreed operations.</p>

                        <p>At a meeting of the Special Group on September 19, 1963, William Colby of
                            the Central Intelligence Agency referred to a detailed review of Agency
                            operations in several areas including China and Tibet. According to a
                            memorandum of the meeting by Thomas A. Parrott, Colby stated that the
                            review had shown those activities were “not especially productive.” The
                            memorandum continues: “Therefore, the responsible operators have come to
                            the conclusion that probably a change of approach is indicated. This
                            would restrict targets to those of real significance, and would provide
                            sufficient agent forces to accomplish the objective. Sizeable losses
                            would have to be anticipated.” (Central Intelligence Agency, <gloss target="#t_DCI1">DCI</gloss> (<persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName>) Files, Job 80-B01285A, Box 1, 303 Committee

                        <p>Current trends underline the need for taking a new look at the problem of
                            Communist China in a changing world: the deepening of the Sino-Soviet
                                <pb n="398" xml:id="pg_398" facs="0434"/>rift, the growing
                            triangulation of the Cold War, the new diffusion of power and authority
                            in the Communist world, progress in arms control counter-balanced by
                            evidence that a truculent China may soon enter the nuclear club, and
                            signs that Peiping baffled by the great leap backward and the enormity
                            of China's long-term economic problems is casting about for new
                            solutions which could involve dangers and/or opportunities for us.</p>
                        <p>In this situation there is a need to lay the foundation for a
                            longer-range China policy, for a better coverage of North Korea, North
                            Vietnam and Outer Mongolia, for closer attention to the world-wide
                            implications for US policy of the Sino-Soviet split and for new focus on
                            Subcontinent affairs as they affect China. This Bureau must share
                            responsibility for developing policy affecting Communist Asia and must
                            assume the main responsibility for carrying out these policies.</p>
                        <p>Although Mainland China, North Vietnam, North Korea and Outer Mongolia
                            comprise two-thirds of the land area of the Far East and have over
                            two-thirds of the population of the Far East, it is a fact that at
                            present there are only two officers in the Bureau of Far Eastern Affairs
                            who spend full time on Mainland Chinese affairs, working under an
                            officer in charge who devotes perhaps two-thirds of his time to Mainland
                            China. These three officers comprise a sub-section of the Office of East
                            Asian Affairs which is responsible for Japan, Korea, and Taiwan as well
                            as Mainland China. Obviously, the Office's overwhelming concern is with
                            operational problems affecting Korea, Taiwan and Japan, the first two of
                            which are major recipients of our aid with the largest armed forces in
                            free Asia while Japan is by far the most important nation of the free
                            Far East. The Office has little capacity left for Mainland China.
                            Besides this, there is no officer in the Bureau dealing full time with
                            North Vietnamese or North Korean affairs while Mongolia is almost
                            totally ignored.</p>
                        <p>We, therefore, believe it essential to make certain adjustments in the
                            structure of the Bureau to permit more adequate coverage and handling of
                            Asian Communist affairs. (We recognize that we should avoid creating any
                            public impression of change in our China policy, but we feel there may
                            be advantage in acknowledging efforts being made to follow more closely
                            Asian Bloc developments and implications for the US.)</p>
                        <p>We propose to establish an Office of Asian Communist Affairs which will
                            have the responsibility within the Bureau of reinvigorating our China
                            policy and meeting all other requirements for increased attention to
                            Asian Communist affairs. The new Office will be small, consisting of a
                            Director and five or six officers with area and functional specialties.
                            Three of these would be taken from the Mainland China desk of the Office
                            of East Asian Affairs thus relieving that Office of responsibility for
                            Mainland China affairs. Additional officers would include a Sino-Soviet
                            specialist, a <pb n="399" xml:id="pg_399" facs="0435"/>specialist in

                            favorably commented upon as a fine example of creative and imaginative
                            thinking. There was consensus with the paper's thesis that the advent of
                            a ChiCom nuclear capability would heighten already existing issues
                            rather than pose wholly new problems.</p>
                        <p>Reference was made to the possibility that a ChiCom nuclear capability
                            might create rather more difficulty with respect to the position of the
                            Republic of China than the paper concluded. For example, it could <pb n="400" xml:id="pg_400" facs="0436"/>significantly affect morale on
                            Taiwan, help undermine international support for the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> (either as a result of international
                            reaction to mainland raids or of pressures for expanded communication
                            with Peiping) and create difficulties through Peiping's possible
                            exploitation of the offshores situation.</p>
                        <p>The Soviet estimate puts a later date upon the development of ChiCom
                            advanced weapons capabilities than U.S. estimates; the possibility
                            exists that we have overestimated the extent of Soviet technical aid to
                            the ChiComs. U.S. intelligence may, however, now be better than that of
                            the USSR on the ChiCom program. Prevention of a ChiCom nuclear
                            capability is one important goal that we share in common with the
                            Soviets. The USSR may mobilize all the means at its disposal to
                            forestall the ChiComs from acquiring a nuclear capability. The test ban
                            treaty may have been a step in this campaign.</p>
                        <p>There was discussion of how the Chinese Communist nuclear capability
                            would affect the Moscow-Peiping alliance. In September the Soviets made
                            it clear that there were at least two areas in which the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would not feel obliged to honor the
                            treaty: in the event of ChiCom aggression against India, or in the
                            Taiwan Straits. Thus, the Soviet nuclear umbrella over the “Socialist
                            camp” does not mean unqualified support for ChiCom aggression.</p>
                        <p>There was discussion of whether a ChiCom nuclear capability would cause
                            other Asian nations to move closer to either China or the U.S. (in the
                            light of the estimate in the paper that Asian countries were likely, at
                            least initially, to be confirmed in their present policies). It was
                            pointed out that it did not require a large nuclear arsenal to terrorize
                            Asian neighbors and coerce them into political compromises favorable to
                            Peiping. The threat of one nuclear bomb on Calcutta could conceivably
                            give Communist China considerable political leverage. The ChiComs might
                            also hope to use their nuclear capability as a deterrent to response to
                            major conventional aggression. On the other hand, the fear of a U.S.
                            nuclear response to a nuclear attack would act as a major restraint on
                            Communist China. U.S. countermoves and the U.S. military posture in the
                            area will go far to determine the course which China's Asian neighbors
                            will adopt once China has the bomb. For reasons developed in the paper,
                            including effects on the willingness of Asian countries to seek U.S.
                            aid, the emphasis should be on a strong U.S. conventional
                            capability.</p>
                        <p>Question was raised as to whether we should reject outright as a future
                            course of action the possibility of bringing Communist China into the
                            Eighteen Nation Disarmament Commission (ENDC) (Issue No. 3).<note n="2" xml:id="d191fn2">Reference is to Issue No. 3 in the summary, which
                                asked how the United States could meet probable Chinese Communist
                                efforts to demonstrate peaceful intentions through proposals for
                                Asian nuclear-free zones and the like with positive initiatives,
                                without taking actions seriously unsettling to its Asian allies or
                                inconsistent with other U.S. policies. Several actions were
                                proposed, but bringing Communist China into <pb n="401" xml:id="pg_401" facs="0437"/>the Eighteen-Nation Disarmament
                                Commission was specifically rejected.</note> In the second stage of
                            the disarmament plans discussed at Geneva the adherence of the ChiComs,
                            France and others would be needed. It was agreed that Issue 3 should be
                            revised to make it clear that exclusion of Communist China from the ENDC
                            referred only to the immediate future.</p>
                        <p>Regional disarmament arrangements were unrealistic because there was
                            little prospect that China's neighbors could reduce arms below present
                            levels without endangering internal security needs. It was suggested
                            that we should attempt to divert Peiping from regional solutions,
                            nuclear free zones, etc. (It was noted that it was for this reason that
                            the paper proposed development of the Asian components of the Outline
                            Treaty rather than a separate Asian disarmament scheme.)</p>
                        <p>The difficulties of providing even “temporary limited” increases in
                            military assistance to Asian countries as a form of reassurance
                            following ChiCom detonation of a nuclear device were discussed. It was
                            emphasized that the paper did not contemplate a massive increase in aid,
                            but only modest increases. Nonetheless even the provision of modest
                            additional <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> could become very
                            difficult or impossible in view of the rapidly decreasing availabilities
                            of <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> funds. Such increase would
                            require, at a minimum, hard planning of <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> programs and hard selling to Congress.</p>
                        <p>It was questioned whether military assistance for conventional military
                            equipment would be a relevant form of response to a ChiCom nuclear
                            capability; it was pointed out that we did not want to burden ourselves
                            with needless additional assistance requirements. In answer it was noted
                            that assistance in air defense was likely to be considered relevant so
                            long as the ChiComs depended upon aircraft for delivery. India was cited
                            as a case where assistance to air defense probably increased the will to
                            resist. Moreover, the real threat would continue to be conventional
                            rather than nuclear in character and Asian countries were likely to seek
                            additional U.S. aid as a form of general reassurance of the U.S.
                            commitment to their defense.</p>
                        <p>It was suggested that the colored peoples of the world might rally to a
                            nuclear-armed China. However, the colored peoples would also tend to
                            fear China and to press a settlement on her rather than to rally to her
                            standard. It was partly for this reason that Communist China could be
                                <pb n="402" xml:id="pg_402" facs="0438"/>expected to emphasize its
                            defensive and peaceful purposes in the post-detonation period.</p>
                        <p>ChiCom acquisition of the bomb will pose immediate problems that are
                            diplomatic or political, rather than military, in nature. China is
                            likely to strike a conciliatory stance from her new position of strength
                            and wait for her neighbors to rush to the bargaining table. A good
                            example of this tactic was China's sudden acceptance of a cease-fire and
                            partial withdrawal after the invasion of India.</p>
                        <p>The question of the nuclear threshold was discussed and the similarity to
                            the problem in Germany suggested. Just as the Germans demand an
                            unambiguous commitment to nuclear defense, so the Asians might want to
                            lower the nuclear threshold, rather than raise it as the paper
                            advocates. We may well be put in the same position as in Europe-that of
                            asking our allies to increase their conventional forces while they
                            prefer to solve defense problems through greater nuclear protection.
                            However, it was pointed out that the Germans, when it comes to cases
                            rather than questions of general defense theory, admit the need of a
                            conventional response as less likely to lead to obliteration of their
                            country. Similar attitudes may be expected in Asia where, in any event,
                            attitudes toward nuclear weapons are somewhat different.</p>
                        <p>There are few real targets for nuclear attack by Communist China in the
                            area. In the Korean War we were ourselves faced with a similar
                            situation: outside of the mass bombing of cities, there were no targets
                            in China whose destruction would affect matters on the battlefield.
                            Japan would present targets, but some of the most important targets in
                            Asia would be U.S. military installations and the Chinese were most
                            unlikely to attack these with nuclear weapons.</p>
                        <p>It was suggested that the statement of the second major conclusion in the
                            summary paper<note n="3" xml:id="d191fn3">It reads: <p>“Whatever U.S.
                                    intentions, so long as the ChiComs have only soft, vulnerable
                                    delivery means, they will have to take account of the danger of
                                    pre-emptive U.S. counterforce action in military crisis
                                    situations. This could increase ChiCom caution.”</p>
                            </note> was somewhat misleading. As the basic paper itself made clear, a
                            “pre-emptive” counter-force strike by the U.S. was ruled out. While the
                            conclusion intended only to refer to the ChiCom perception of their
                            situation and to the concern that perception could generate, it might be
                            misinterpreted to imply the possibility of such a pre-emptive strike. It
                            was agreed that the paper should be revised to avoid any such
                                implication.<note n="4" xml:id="d191fn4">The second major conclusion
                                in the revised paper of October 15 reads: <p>“Whatever actual U.S.
                                    intentions, so long as the ChiComs have only soft, vulnerable
                                    delivery means, they will have to take account of the danger of
                                    a U.S. nuclear or non-nuclear counterforce attack as a possible
                                    U.S. response to major ChiCom aggression. This could increase
                                    ChiCom caution.”</p>

                                memorandum.<note n="1" xml:id="d192fn1">Neither printed.</note> The
                            first is entitled “Revision of Travel Regulations Governing American
                            Citizens”, with an annex providing talking points detailing our reasons
                            for believing that a change in the travel rules is desirable. The second
                            is entitled “Diplomatic Recognition of Mongolian People's Republic”; it
                            also is annexed with talking points.</p>
                        <p>These two subjects seem unconnected. However, there are real advantages
                            for taking action on both issues more or less simultaneously: the
                            combined effect would be that we are trying to keep ourselves as well
                            informed as possible on Communist Asia, siding neither with Moscow nor
                            Peiping.</p>
                        <p>Recognition of Mongolia is a tactical decision, and we believe the
                            national interest justifies it. A more basic issue is involved in the
                            travel question: If we are interested in freedom, we have an interest in
                            holding restriction on travel to a minimum. We believe that only in the
                            case of Cuba are the foreign policy considerations so clear as to
                            require that we continue to forbid travel by Americans. To other areas
                            wherein we have no representation, we will discourage travel but not
                            forbid it.</p>
                        <p>Our principal problem with recognition of Mongolia will be the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>'s reaction. The principal problem with
                            the change of the travel rules will be domestic charges that “the
                            Administration is going soft on Communism”. Answers to these and other
                            criticisms will be found in the annexed talking papers.</p>
                        <p>Both actions should be done before the 1964 election campaign reaches
                            full crescendo. The proposal on travel is consistent with the policies
                            which have been stated by this Administration, and the net effect on the
                            electorate may well be favorable, but the announcement should be made in
                            a relatively calm atmosphere, sufficiently well in advance of the <pb n="404" xml:id="pg_404" facs="0440"/>1964 elections to permit a
                            sober consensus to have developed as to the advantages of the
                            action.</p>
                        <p>If the recommendation to go ahead with the change in travel rules is
                            accepted, there would appear to be no requirement for extra-Departmental
                            clearances (since Justice has already cleared the original proposal),
                            though we might check with Defense and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> as a courtesy. <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
                            would probably be delighted over the change. Once it had been decided by
                            the Administration to move on the travel question, there would be
                            advance consultations with key Congressional leaders. Preparation should
                            be made to notify interested governments shortly before the travel
                            changes go into effect. The line for responding to press inquiries will
                            need to be considered. A background briefing for selected members of the
                            press might help to launch the new regulations properly.</p>

                                interdepartmental group of high-level officials who met regularly
                                for informal discussions. Most of their discussions were apparently

                            essential conclusion is that ChiCom acquisition of a semi-nuclear
                            capability will not have much more than a marginally significant impact
                            and can probably be coped with by some marginal stepping up of existing
                            programs. Its major emphasis is on a variety of reassurances which we
                            can give our Asian friends; in no case do these involve radical
                            departures from existing policy.</p>

                        <p>The consensus was that the Chinese would remain basically cautious in the
                            overt use of force even after they acquired a few nucs; first use by
                            them would be highly unlikely—instead they would see their nucs as a
                            deterrent to escalation by us.</p>
                        <p>There was much discussion on how to “strangle the baby in the cradle”
                            before the Chinese developed a capability, but if my reading of the
                            thrust of the paper (above) is correct, there would seem to be less
                            incentive for us to do so.</p>

                        <p>11. <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> said he would look into

                            days.</p>
                        <p>12. I expressed regret we seemed be far apart on most matters this
                            meeting. Reiterated Republic of China operating U-2s and saw no reason
                            for responsibility to be placed on US. With reference his quotation

                            opinions. I then referred to recent Soviet-Chinese exchange of
                            communications and said that Chinese statements themselves showed that
                            his side was aggressive. Agreed we had worked against admission to

                            not want them to remain but they themselves had raised obstacles to
                            their immediate deportation.<note n="9" xml:id="d194fn9">Telegram 823 to

                        <p>13. <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> misunderstood my
                            comments about Sino-Soviet communications and thought I had referred to
                            Soviet not Chinese statements. He stated it was inappropriate in these
                            talks to refer to third countries and expressed view it was futile to
                            cite Soviet statements as defense our own hostile policy. He described
                            Soviet Union as great Socialist country whose people had glorious
                            revolutionary tradition and said it would be premature for anyone to
                            show delight or to attempt to profit from dispute.</p>
                        <p>14. <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> claimed our obstructive
                            tactics <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> becoming more unpopular each
                            year and it was not up to US to determine unilaterally which countries
                            are peace-loving. Said our obstructive tactics would go bankrupt.</p>
                        <p>15. I straightened out his confusion re my reference to Soviet and
                            Chinese statements emphasizing the manner and reasonable man would
                            interpret Chinese statements regarding their attitude towards matters
                            which impinge on our interests.</p>
                        <p>16. I suggested next meeting be held January 8 but <persName corresp="#p_WPWB1">Wang</persName> requested it be January 29. I

                            present were Couve de Murville, Alphand and de la Grandville who served
                            as interpreter.</p>

                        <p>I then reverted to the subject of the Communist world and relations
                            between the Soviet Union and China. I said we were concerned at the
                            evidence of Chinese militancy—one aspect of the dispute with the Soviet
                            Union—and that in our talks at Warsaw they were insistent that we should
                            give up Formosa. There had also been the Indian attack and we felt that
                            Hanoi and Peking together had blocked the implementation of the Laotian
                            accords. There was also some evidence that the Chinese were stimulating
                            Sukarno in his present courses of action; they were active in Latin
                            America, particularly with Castro; and finally <persName corresp="#p_CEZE1">Chou En-lai</persName> was at present in Africa.
                            We felt it important that Peking not be given any impression that any
                            such policy would pay dividends. I mentioned that we had been very glad
                            to hear that France had no intention of recognizing China<note n="2" xml:id="d195fn2">Reference is to a conversation on November 5

                                in telegram 2222 from Paris, November 5. When <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName> asked <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> about his views on
                                Communist China, he replied that he had no intention of proceeding
                                with any such step as diplomatic relations “at this time” but that
                                he thought “sooner or later” some relationships would have to be
                                worked out. (Ibid., Central Files, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 16 <gloss target="#t_CHICOM1">CHICOM</gloss>)</note> but felt it was worthwhile keeping in
                            contact on such developments. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName> then made rather a long statement that with the
                            Chinese-Soviet dispute the Soviets seemed to have calmed down while
                            Peking was taking on “as a trial gallop” the task of promoting
                            revolution, but he doubted if they would be any more successful than the
                            Soviets had been except in Eastern Europe where the armies controlled.
                            He said the question was how the West could turn this to its advantage,
                            whether it was best to leave China alone completely or have certain
                            contacts. He felt that such contacts had helped in the past with Soviet
                            Russia. I replied I could not see much evidence of our influence in our
                            contacts with the Soviets and I had felt that the change in Soviet
                            attitude was due to the confrontation with military power in the West,
                            possibly increased by the <pb n="410" xml:id="pg_410" facs="0446"/>attitude of their own people and from the Eastern European countries.
                            After all Moscow had been the most dangerous on Berlin and Cuba.
                            Furthermore there had been no signs that the contacts with Peking such
                            as the extremely friendly ones on the part of India and more informal
                            ones on the part of Japan had had any effect on the Chinese. I told him
                            I thought it would be a great mistake to let the Chinese or their
                            Communist allies get any idea that such policies paid off.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> agreed that the Soviets
                            had been the more dangerous of the two but questioned whether they would
                            not have been more so if we allowed them to “stew in their own juice”,
                            offering no alternative except war. He felt that the contacts had
                            certainly not been unuseful. He agreed that India's and Japan's contacts
                            had not changed the Chinese very much, but after all these were “poor”
                            countries which had little to offer China whereas if at some time in the
                            future the West might be in a position to establish relations with China
                            this might be another story.</p>
                        <p>I pointed out that in Warsaw in nine years of contacts we had seen no
                            interest insofar as Chinese trying to improve relations except at the
                            cost of abandonment of Formosa. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName> significantly said that Formosa would have to be
                            sacrificed by the West (by implication in any agreement with the
                            ChiComs).</p>
                        <p>In order to button down the French position further I inquired of
                                <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> whether he had any
                            judgment as to the timing of any relationship with ChiComs and how far
                            in the future this was to be since I understood that France was thinking
                            of diplomatic relations for the future. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName> said he could not answer this since it was a
                            question for the future, and it depended on others and not France alone,
                            but wished to assure me “as Secretary of State” that they would talk to
                            the U.S. before any action was taken.</p>
                        <p>The conversation concluded with a mutual agreement to keep in touch on
                            matters of the Soviet Union and particularly in regard to the
                            Sino-Soviet dispute; and an exchange of amenities including a personal

                        <p>1. The Policy</p>
                        <p>a) Our policy towards Communist China is one of firmness, flexibility and
                            dispassion. We are firm in our commitment to the government of the
                            Republic of China and people of Taiwan and in our resistance to all
                            forms of aggression by the Chinese Communists. We are flexible in our
                            readiness to respond to a significant change in the behavior of the
                            Peiping regime. We are dispassionate in our refusal to substitute
                            cliches and polemical rhetoric for cool, objective analysis.</p>
                        <p>One parallel to this policy can be found in our recent relations with the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. When the Soviets placed
                            missiles in Cuba, we responded with firmness; but six months later, when
                            the Soviets sought a Test Ban agreement, we were willing to negotiate.
                            b) On the specific point of the Peiping regime's viability, we doubt the
                            possibility of its overthrow for two reasons:</p>
                        <p>—Police states of such a far-reaching nature are notoriously invulnerable
                            to uprisings by an inadequately armed populace;</p>
                        <p>—China's leaders, despite their intensive dogmatism, have shown a
                            tendency to pull back and become pragmatic in the face of serious
                            internal or external resistance.</p>
                        <p>Hence, as I concluded in my speech: “We hope that, confronted with
                            firmness which will make foreign adventure unprofitable, and yet offered
                            the prospect that the way back into the community of man is not closed
                            to it, the Chinese Communist regime will eventually forsake its <pb n="412" xml:id="pg_412" facs="0448"/>present venomous hatreds which
                            spring from a rigid class view of society.”</p>
                        <p>2. The Implications</p>
                        <p>The speech signifies no change in U.S. policy, no new departure.<note n="2" xml:id="d196fn2">For text, see <ref target="frus1955-57v03">

                        </p>
                        <p>It is significant primarily as the first attempt in some time to
                            articulate the policies we have been pursuing toward Communist China for
                            several years.</p>
                        <p>It should be added that we have similarly pursued a policy of firmness
                            and flexibility toward the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>3. The Timing</p>
                        <p>The speech was given at this time for the following reasons:</p>
                        <p>a) The Commonwealth Club of San Francisco asked me to—early this
                            autumn.</p>
                        <p>b) No full-scale rational analysis of U.S. China policy has been
                            available for public information since Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName>' speech in San Francisco of June 28, 1957.<note n="3" xml:id="d196fn3">At President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>'s press conference on November 14 in
                                response to a question under what conditions the United States might
                                resume “some sort of trade with Red China,” he replied in part as
                                follows: “We are not planning to trade with Red China in view of the
                                policy that Red China pursues. When the Red Chinese indicate a
                                desire to live at peace with the United States, with other countries
                                surrounding it, then quite obviously the United States would
                                reappraise its policies. We are not wedded to a policy of hostility
                                to Red China.” (<hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the Presidents of
                                    the United States: <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">John F.

                        </p>
                        <p>c) There was a need to clarify the reasons for the apparent divergence
                            between U.S. treatment of Moscow and U.S. treatment of Peiping. As the
                            Soviets have begun to behave more responsibly, the U.S. has become more
                            responsive to Soviet initiatives; but with Peiping continuing to hew to
                            a bellicose Stalinist line, we have been unresponsive to the Chinese.
                            This apparent divergence stems from a consistent policy of firmness and
                            flexibility, as applied to two regimes whose behavior currently
                            differs.</p>
                        <p>I hope that these points will be of use to you.</p>

                        <p>DEAR <persName>ROGER</persName>: Having been on the job here for six
                            months, I feel that I have my teeth reasonably dug into the situation. I
                            am, therefore, compiling a brief summary of important aspects of recent
                            developments which I think should be elaborated in a personal exchange
                            with you.</p>
                        <p>Mainland Recovery Activities</p>
                        <p>With respect to the most delicate problem which has concerned us over the
                            past two years—<gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> preparations for
                            military action against the mainland—we seem to be in a prolonged
                            quiescent period. Statements to President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName>, and to <persName corresp="#p_CC2">Chiang
                                Ching-kuo</persName> during the latter's visit to the United States,
                            reaffirming United States opposition to any overt military action by the
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> under present circumstances,
                            combined with assurances of continued United States support for the
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> and acquiescence in small-scale
                            clandestine operations plus study of other possibilities, appear to have
                            served their purpose. Even though small-scale raids continued through
                            October and November, accompanied by much high-flown publicity, there is
                            little evidence that President <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> contemplates cranking up the military machine for
                            any early large-scale action.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> sees little prospect of any
                            significant economic recovery on the China mainland in the near future
                            or any patching up of the Sino-Soviet dispute. These conclusions have
                            tended to keep down the feeling of urgency here. However, there is a
                            risk that this feeling may build up again over the next few months
                            stimulated by the rush of European countries and Japan to do business
                            with Communist China and by the downward trend of United States economic
                            and military aid to the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>. There is no
                            sign yet that we are likely to run into a rising curve of secret
                            military preparations here such as occurred in the spring of 1961 and to
                            a lesser degree early in 1962, but we will keep our eyes open for
                            indications.</p>
                        <p>Japan-<gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> Relations</p>
                        <p>In the political field we have devoted considerable time in the past few
                            weeks to the question of relations between the Republic of China and <pb n="414" xml:id="pg_414" facs="0450"/>Japan. The basic disquiet here
                            arising from expanding Japanese trade with the Chinese mainland and the
                            political implications of this expansion have been exacerbated by
                            statements by Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName>
                            questioning the return-to-the-mainland policy and by the case of the
                            ChiCom defector, <persName corresp="#p_CEZE1">Chou</persName>
                            Hung-ching, still in Japan.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> has been somewhat encouraged by
                            the success of its protests in delaying <persName corresp="#p_CEZE1">Chou</persName>'s repatriation, but continues to press for access
                            to him. If the Japanese Government gives the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> access to <persName corresp="#p_CEZE1">Chou</persName>,
                            as it now seems inclined to do, and provides a further breathing spell
                            before he is repatriated, reaction here may not be too serious. There is
                            some evidence that the Chinese are endeavoring to prepare a situation in
                            which the return of the defector to the mainland could be treated with
                            measures short of either disruption of trade relations or impairment of
                            diplomatic relations with Japan.</p>
                        <p>Recent press treatment of the subject has been moderate and it has been
                            emphasized that <persName corresp="#p_CEZE1">Chou</persName> has been
                            “brainwashed” by the ChiComs and is being forced to return to protect
                            his family's safety. In these terms it could be demonstrated that he
                            would not have made an unfettered decision not to come to Taiwan. The
                            Japanese, of course, would continue to be castigated for permitting
                            leftist influences access to him.</p>
                        <p>Cabinet</p>
                        <p>Recent government changes here in Taipei will not, we think, result in
                            fundamental changes in the direction of <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> policies. C.K. Yen, the new Premier, can be expected to
                            devote major energies to continuing economic development, financial
                            stability and continuation of necessary United States aid arrangements,
                            to the extent he is permitted to do so by the Gimo and the hard-line
                            “return-to-mainland” supporters. There is general agreement he will not
                            be a strong premier and his policies will be heavily dependent on
                            presidential guidance and backing. The resignation of Chen Cheng as
                            premier generally is interpreted as portending a long-term diminution of
                            his influence in the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> and this
                            probably will, in fact, be the case. At the same time, the President's
                            son, General <persName corresp="#p_CC2">Chiang Ching-kuo</persName>, is
                            very likely to achieve greater influence. However, the full implications
                            of the new government are not yet discernible.</p>
                        <p>Representation at Funeral</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> has been subject, as you know, to
                            some criticism because of an allegedly inadequate response to President
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>'s assassination. Our
                            assessment is that the question was fumbled until the point had been
                            reached where there was insufficient time to send someone, even after
                            realization that a special delegation from the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would be conspicuous by its absence.</p>
                        <p>I see no important political significance in this matter and I think we
                            should make every effort, as we have endeavored to do, to help mitigate

                            this score. The Japanese seem inclined to “make something” out of this
                            blunder, but <persName corresp="#p_REO1">Reischauer</persName> is on top
                            of the situation.</p>
                        <p>Relations with President</p>
                        <p>I have taken advantage of the visits of various prominent Americans
                            recently and their calls on the President to take him aside briefly for
                            discussions and presentations of interest to us. I believe that I am
                            achieving a useful relationship with him and, for my part, I believe
                            that these brief exchanges have served constructive purposes.</p>
                        <p>Reduction in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 64 Program and <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 65 Military Aid Plan</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 64 Program as revised at <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> in November and forwarded to
                            the Department of Defense reduced the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> China ceiling from $133.8 million to $94.8 million.
                            The <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 65 ceiling was reduced from $163.0
                            million to $108.4 million. The reduction in ceilings and in investment
                            funds available for force modernization will increase the shortfall
                            which must be funded in later years. Modernization of F-86F and C-46
                            squadrons and purchase of destroyers, tanks and armored personnel
                            carriers, in addition to any minor but essential items, will not be
                            possible under this reduced funding.</p>
                        <p>The second battalion of Nike-Hercules missiles is still funded in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 64. However, the President has authorized
                            deletion of this item under provisions which will be difficult to
                            accept. <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss>'s action has gone to
                            Defense. If the deletion is approved, the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 64 program will be reduced accordingly since it is very
                            doubtful we will recoup any of these funds. The prospect is for a
                            gradual decline in the overall capabilities of <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> forces, as equipment will not be modernized or replaced
                            as rapidly as it wears out.</p>
                        <p> F/RF-104G</p>
                        <p>One squadron of eight RF-104G aircraft and seven F-104G aircraft have
                            arrived in Taiwan. All F/RF-104G's will be initially based at Kung Kuan.
                            Upon receipt of additional facilities and equipment, the reconnaissance
                            models will move to Taoyuan.</p>
                        <p>Economic Aid</p>
                        <p>Progress is being made by the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> in
                            obtaining loans from international sources to replace the inflow of
                            United States funds as the economic aid program is phased out. The World
                            Bank made a loan to the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> of almost $8
                            million repayable on commercial terms (5-1/2 percent interest, 15-year
                            term). Burke Knapp, Vice President of the World Bank, told us and the
                            Chinese on a visit here that the Bank was anxious to expand its lending
                            program here.</p>
                        <p>Another favorable development has been the rapid increase in <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> exports to US$295 million in the first
                            ten months of 1963 as compared <pb n="416" xml:id="pg_416" facs="0452"/>with a preliminary Chinese estimate of US$270 million for the entire
                            year. It appears that exports may well reach US$330-350 million for the
                            year. This increase resulted largely from the fortuitous rise this year
                            in the price of sugar, but other exports also increased by an impressive
                            22 percent. The government is concentrating increasing effort on the
                            promotion of exports. [Here follows brief discussion of copyright

                                Department of State Executive Secretariat Director Walter J.
                                Stoessel, Jr., to General Andrew J. Goodpaster, enclosing an undated
                                paper prepared in the Department of State headed “United States
                                Policy Toward Outer Mongolia.” The paper discussed the possibility
                                of U.S. recognition of Mongolia but recommended against it;
                                Stoessel's memorandum states that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> was sending the paper to
                                President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> for his
                                information but wished to review the matter before making a

                            to review our policy toward Outer Mongolia and recommend a course of
                            action.</p>
                        <p>The matter has now been thoroughly reviewed<note n="2" xml:id="d198fn2">A
                                May 4 memorandum from Assistant Secretary of State for European
                                Affairs <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Foy D. Kohler</persName> to
                                    <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> discussed the

                                611.93C/5-461)</note> and I believe that we should be prepared to
                            extend diplomatic recognition to Outer Mongolia if we can reach
                            agreement on an exchange of diplomatic missions and obtain specific
                            assurance that our mission in Ulan Bator would be able to operate in a
                            reasonably normal fashion. In arriving at this position I have given
                            particular weight to the utility of that mission as a source of
                            information. Ulan Bator would be a most useful place from which to
                            observe and evaluate differences between the Soviet Union and Communist
                            China, and these differences, of course, have significant and
                            farreaching implications for our foreign policy. Furthermore, the
                            presence of a mission in Ulan Bator would provide improved access to
                            some areas of the Soviet Union. We would plan to accredit our Ambassador
                            in Moscow also to Ulan Bator and assign officers there for one year
                            tours largely from Embassy Moscow. Travel of these officers and of
                            couriers to and from Ulan Bator would traverse sectors of the Soviet
                            Union now usually inaccessible.</p>
                        <pb n="418" xml:id="pg_418" facs="0454"/>
                        <p>I have taken into account the counterargument that recognition of Outer
                            Mongolia would have adverse effects throughout the Far East and
                            particularly on our relations with the Republic of China. We have
                            already received indications of that government's displeasure over the
                            possibility, and our Ambassador in Taipei has commented that the
                            difficulties of reaching an accommodation with the Republic of China
                            over the issue of Chinese representation in the United Nations will be
                            greatly increased if we proceed with our recognition of the Outer
                            Mongolian regime.</p>
                        <p>However, I believe the course of recent events in the United Nations has
                            affected these objections. The Brazzaville group of African states and
                            the French agreed to go along with the Soviet idea of a package deal
                            involving admission of both Outer Mongolia and Mauritania. We concluded
                            that if we followed this course we would find ourselves in the position
                            of appearing to have been entrapped by a Soviet maneuver and would also
                            have less likelihood of obtaining Outer Mongolian agreement to the
                            establishment of a U.S. mission in Ulan Bator under satisfactory
                            operating conditions. Moreover, we fear that a veto of Outer Mongolia by
                            the Republic of China would have adverse effects on the Republic of
                            China's position in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. Consequently,
                            we are seeking to mobilize sufficient abstentions in the Security
                            Council to block Outer Mongolian membership and will probably be
                            successful in this effort.</p>
                        <p>We explained in the General Assembly that we are reexamining the question
                            of Outer Mongolian sovereignty and if our examination discloses that
                            that country has the attributes of sovereignty, including the ability
                            and willingness to establish normal diplomatic and cultural relations
                            with other countries, we will be prepared to support and even co-sponsor
                            Outer Mongolian application for <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            membership.</p>
                        <p>I believe that our position at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            affords us the most advantageous grounds on which to make an approach to
                            the Outer Mongolians. However, I would recommend that we proceed no
                            matter what the outcome of the anticipated proceedings in the Security
                            Council.</p>
                        <p>We have discussed our proposed line of action with both the Senate
                            Foreign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee in

                            consideration of this matter took note of Ambassador Menshikov's

                            of US decision to extend recognition but is designed ascertain whether

                        <p>A letter of July 20, 1961, from Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for
                            European Affairs Richard H. Davis to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> reads in part as follows:</p>
                        <p>“Since you are no doubt wondering what has happened to the detailed
                            negotiating instructions for your dealings with the Outer Mongolian
                            Ambassador, I thought I had better let you know where the matter stands.
                            At present the package is in suspense, physically resting in <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Alex Johnson</persName>'s In-box. I am sure you
                            are aware of the fuss which <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang
                                Kai-shek</persName> has kicked up over the prospect of our
                            recognizing the MPR. This has apparently had some effect in Congress and
                            has spilled over to involve passage of foreign aid legislation and our
                            public stance vis-a-vis the Berlin crisis. Thus, there appears to have
                            been a decision to do nothing further with regard to Outer Mongolia for
                            an indefinite period.” (Department of State, Central Files,

                            declaring that although the United States had for some time been
                            exploring the question of the establishment of relations with Mongolia,
                            “We believe that in view of the existing world situation, it is in the
                            best interests of the United States to suspend further exploration of
                            that matter at this time.” (Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, September 4, 1961, pages 408-409)</p>
                        <p>On October 25 the United Nations Security Council recommended the
                            admission of the Mongolian People's Republic to the United Nations by a
                            vote of 9-0; the United States abstained, and the Republic of China did
                            not participate in the vote. Documentation concerning U.S. efforts to
                            prevent the Republic of China's use of the veto on this question is in

                        <p>DEAR BOB: I am most anxious to draw your personal attention to a problem
                            which all of us here regard as of great and urgent importance to our
                            relations with Korea. The Korean Government has intermittently raised
                            the subject of a status of forces agreement since 1955, and in recent
                            times this has developed into a major popular issue with increasingly
                            serious implications.<note n="1" xml:id="d201fn1">In telegrams 1063,
                                1087, and 1088 from Seoul, February 22, 28, and 28, the Embassy in
                                Korea reported growing public pressure for a status of forces
                                agreement and recommended high-level exploratory talks with the
                                    <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> as a prelude to opening
                                negotiations on the issue. In telegram 1087 Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MCWP1">McConaughy</persName> reported that <gloss target="#t_CINCUNC1">CINCUNC</gloss> General <persName corresp="#p_MBGCB1">Magruder</persName> thought that the Embassy
                                was exaggerating the force of the public pressure for a status of
                                forces agreement, but agreed with the Embassy's recommendation about
                                the need for preliminary discussion. (Department of State, Central
                                Files, 611.95B7/2-2261 and 611.95B7/2-2861)</note> As things stand
                            now, this issue essentially involves two basic questions: The Korean
                            Government apparently wants us to pay some compensation to private
                            Korean owners of facilities used by our forces in Korea; and it desired
                            to have at least partial, and presumably nominal, criminal jurisdiction
                            over our troops there. Korea is the only nation where we have exclusive
                            jurisdiction over our forces, except for Taiwan, where this subject is
                            under negotiation.</p>
                        <p>We have always held, and, I believe, should continue to insist that the
                            Korean Government take full responsibility for any property claims
                            involving our forces in Korea. I am convinced, however, that the time
                            has come when we should proceed to negotiate promptly a full status of
                            forces agreement with Korea, including some politically realistic
                            formula on criminal jurisdiction which would in actual practice preserve
                            for us a maximum degree of jurisdiction over our forces in Korea. In my
                            view the foregoing conclusion remains valid despite the fact that a
                            technical state of suspended hostilities still exists in Korea.</p>
                        <p>The Koreans are well aware that we have status of forces agreements with
                            many other countries around the world, and believe that their sovereign
                            status should be treated with equal consideration. They are especially
                            sensitive over the fact that we have concluded a status of forces
                            agreement with Japan including an agreement on criminal jurisdiction <pb n="423" xml:id="pg_423" facs="0459"/>comparable with those signed

                                328)</note> Inevitably, many Koreans regard our present position as
                            one of discrimination against a country which has shed more blood than
                            any other since World War II in the common cause of resisting Communist
                            aggression.</p>
                        <p>In view of the fact that in Korean eyes the conclusion of a status of
                            forces agreement has now come to be a real symbol of Korean sovereignty
                            and legitimate nationalism, I am convinced that in the long run it will
                            best serve our national interests to reach such an agreement with the
                            present <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Government. This Government
                            is moderate, conservative, and striving to meet the natural and
                            justifiable expectations of its people. It is currently under heavy
                            pressure in connection with the series of vital but unpopular economic
                            reforms which we have insisted are necessary for further progress. It
                            would be a disservice to our interests to attempt to place such a
                            Government in the impossible position of resisting strong popular
                            opinion on the status of forces issue and at the same time to expose our
                            own Government to increasing criticism by broad and important segments
                            of the Korean public, as well as a large and vocal parliamentary
                            opposition. I think there is good reason to hope that, if we move now in
                            a resolute and constructive way, we will be able to arrive at an
                            agreement more advantageous to us than any we could reach later with any
                            succeeding Korean administration, when nationalist sentiments would
                            surely have become stronger in Korea.</p>
                        <p>I hope that you will agree that we should commence negotiations with the
                            Republic of Korea as soon as possible on a full status of forces
                            agreement, and look forward to an occasion to talk with you further
                            about this matter in the very near future.<note n="3" xml:id="d201fn3">Responding for the Department of Defense in a March 10 letter to

                                engaged in a study of whether it was possible to work out a

                        <p>THE SITUATION IN KOREA, FEBRUARY 1961</p>
                        <p>Summary</p>
                        <p>There are three basic circumstances prevailing in Korea today, the
                            conjunction of which makes it imperative that the U.S. Government
                            recognize the gravity of the situation and act promptly to remedy it.
                            The existence of any one or two of these elements without the third
                            would be serious, to be sure, but not such as to warrant emergency
                            consideration and immediate action. The three together, however, are
                            compelling reasons for alarm, for they seriously endanger the whole U.S.
                            position in Korea, and threaten to discredit, not only the aid program
                            in Korea, but the Mutual Security program as a whole.</p>
                        <p>The three elements are these:</p>
                        <p>A. The extent and depth of graft, corruption and fraud in the major
                            institutions of Korean society today and the consequent lack of
                            confidence on the part of Koreans, high and low, in these institutions,
                            in themselves, in their own future, and—because of the absence of a U.S.
                            posture on integrity—an increasing loss of confidence in the U.S. The
                            receptivity of a people in such a frame of mind to Communist and other
                            extremist influence, after 15 years of American presence, is
                            natural.</p>
                        <p>B. The dangerously deteriorating direction of the dynamics of the
                            situation in South Korea, particularly over the next several months—with
                            the economic and social phase of the April 1960 unfinished revolution
                            still to be initiated, with the Government increasingly powerless to
                            take the necessary actions because of its involvement in corruption, and
                            with the probability, in the light of the current U.S. posture, that
                            reaction <pb n="425" xml:id="pg_425" facs="0461"/>against the
                            Government, possibly even revolution, will be strongly
                            anti-American.</p>
                        <p>C. The indecisive and inadequate leadership of the <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> in Korea, its critical role at this
                            time, and the lack of a rapport between the <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> and the decision-makers in the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Government.</p>
                        <p>Following an exposition of these elements, a strategy is outlined for
                            U.S. moves to change radically the present direction of events in Korea,
                            and thus to serve basic Korean and U.S. security interests.<note n="1" xml:id="d202fn1"> Hugh D. Farley was Assistant Director of <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> in Korea until February 24, when
                                his stand on corruption in Korea and his criticism of <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> operations convinced him to
                                submit his resignation. Farley returned to Washington where <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> did not immediately accept his
                                resignation. Instead it asked him to put his criticisms on paper and
                                discuss them with <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> and Department

                            “Integrity,” in which Farley stated that the whole fabric of Korean life

                            which Farley predicted an explosion of popular discontent on April 19,

                        <p>Look at the basic problems of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>:
                            (a) a poor country with few resources and skills; (b) saddled with
                            staggering task of supporting a far larger military establishment than
                            it really able to (or than is needed); (c) corruption feeding on
                            inexperience in democratic government; and (d) a rising nationalism and
                            expectancy frustrated by what the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s
                            increasingly believe is US disinclination to accord them full equality,
                            push for unification, or change overwhelming military emphasis in <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Underlying ills and needs are economic. Major thrust of US effort over
                            next decade must be:</p>
                        <p>a. Substantial cutback in <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> military
                            establishment, with diversion of US funds thus released to crash
                            economic development. Defense of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            could be met by <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> plus US forces in
                            Korea and reminders to Bloc of US intent instantly to protect from
                            outside Korea.</p>
                        <pb n="427" xml:id="pg_427" facs="0463"/>
                        <p>b. Buildup of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> economy, stressing
                            public sector, creation of light labor-intensive industry, and full
                            utilization of main <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            resource—people.</p>
                        <p>c. Much more vigorous, imaginative US action in directing and supervising
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> economic development. In
                            addition to basic long-term projects, the undertaking as well of a
                            number of high-impact, short-term projects for political effect. Closer
                            and more active instruction and supervision of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> government, in such projects, but also more attribution
                            to <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> government of their benefits.</p>
                        <p>d. Insistence on much more vigorous <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            crackdown on corruption, smuggling, illegal profiteering wherever found;
                            similar US action against US nationals guilty of these; strong steps
                            towards a more spartan US standard of life in <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> to avoid present embarrassing disparity.</p>
                        <p>Political actions also imperative:</p>
                        <p>a. Move forcefully to get a satisfactory status of forces agreement. By
                            so doing we can buy public acceptance that our greater involvement in
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> economic direction will
                            require.</p>
                        <p>b. Get <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> to take offensive on
                            unification issue, with <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> public a
                            major target. Unification is an abiding yearning of the Korean people,
                            founded in both nationalistic and economic impulses. The US must
                            pre-sent itself at the forefront of those favoring unification, making
                            sure in the process that terms protect <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> and Free World interests.</p>
                        <p>c. Sharply reduce political role in <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            of US military and its spokesmen; make US Ambassador undisputed
                            spokesman of US policy in Korea; greatly expand educational and labor
                            contacts, leader grants, etc., between US and <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>.<note n="4" xml:id="d203fn4">

                            Technical Assistance Program in Korea. He returned to try to communicate
                            to the town a sense of the dangers and instability in the Korean
                            situation and especially to urge the Government to act before the April

                        <p>The Department of State has reviewed his paper and received an evaluation

                            believe it more likely than Farley does, that we can get through the
                            Spring without a Korean explosion. The underlying fact is that all hands
                            agree the situation in Korea is not good; and American policy in Korea
                            requires a fresh look. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Mac Bundy</persName>

                        <p>Fundamentally, the problem is to get our massive aid to Korea shifted
                            around in a way which would not merely keep Korea from going down for
                            the third time, but would begin to get Korea moving forward. There are
                            in Korean politics, in the post-Rhee situation, elements who might join
                            us in such a forward effort; but, equally, these elements could turn
                            against us. We wish you to be informed of this situation. You may wish

                                Executive Committee (Sheppard of <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_SJM1">Steeves</persName> of the
                                Department of State, and James Cooley of <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>) to Labouisse. This committee concluded that the
                                problems described by Farley were “serious,” but were well-known in
                                Seoul and Washington. The report continued that “Mr. Farley's
                                diagnosis of Korea's ills is too largely centered on the issues of
                                corruption and that the remedies he prescribes are in a major degree
                                too sweeping and too likely to be counter-productive.” It concluded:
                                “In short, we cannot agree with the extent, the nature, and the
                                timing of the measures proposed by Mr. Farley to cope with the
                                problem.” Also attached, but not printed, was a report on Korea by
                                the Assistant Deputy Director and Controller for Mutual Security,
                                Edward F. Tennant, who spent several weeks in Korea in January
                                1961.</note> The Department concurs in the general conclusion
                            reached by the Special Committee that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LHR1">Labouisse</persName> established to inquire into Mr. Farley's
                            proposal. You will note that the conclusion might be summarized as
                            follows: we do not disagree with the broad outlines of the problem as
                            set forth by Mr. Farley; we do not feel that the courses of action
                            proposed are likely to achieve the results that he desires—and which the
                            Department desires as well.</p>
                        <p>I am proposing that a further step be taken, however—one which was
                            discussed with you the other night at dinner.</p>
                        <p>A special mission should be sent to Korea headed by Max Millikan, a
                            mission patterned on the Presidential Special Mission that is now in
                            Bolivia. The purposes of the special mission to Korea would be
                            these:</p>
                        <p>(a) Drawing on the useful report of the Inspector General and Comptroller
                            of January 1961 as a point of departure (the conclusions of this report
                            preceded but coincide fairly closely with the analysis in Mr. Farley's
                            memorandum), the mission should endeavor to translate the report's
                            conclusions into action at the earliest possible date. It should also
                            consider carefully the type of organization needed and the numbers and
                            quality of personnel required to carry out an effective aid program.</p>
                        <p>(b) Using as a point of departure the new aid concepts now decided upon
                            by the President, the special mission should attempt a revamping of the
                            economic effort in Korea consistent with these proposals.</p>
                        <p>(c) The two elements of reform and new program that would be the
                            principal purposes of the special mission would contribute to a third
                                <pb n="430" xml:id="pg_430" facs="0466"/>highly desirable result,
                            namely the building of a body of evidence which would be of great value
                            in the course of presenting the new aid program to Congress. It would be
                            a concrete case study in the application of new development
                            principles.</p>

                        <p>1. The April anniversary of the fall of President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> will be marked by demonstrations
                            and, probably, some acts of violence. In view of present grievances
                            among opposition groups and the public at large, <pb n="431" xml:id="pg_431" facs="0467"/>these demonstrations could be
                            converted—by design or accident—into a major political explosion of some
                            kind in the next month or so. However, the odds appear to be against
                            such an explosion, since present grievances are not as intense or
                            focused as those which gave rise to the 1960 revolution. Nevertheless,
                            the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> will continue to be plagued by
                            formidable economic and political problems, and the long-term outlook
                            for the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> is bleak.<note n="1" xml:id="d206fn1">In a March 23 memorandum to <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_JRH1">Robert Johnson</persName> commented on this <gloss target="#t_SNIE1">SNIE</gloss> and sent it to <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName>.

                        <p>I. Introduction</p>
                        <p>2. April 1961 will mark the first anniversary of the revolution that
                            felled <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Syngman Rhee</persName> and swept his
                            government and his followers from the political scene. Police terrorism
                            and press censorship have been eliminated, but little real progress has
                            been made in the past year on the basic social and economic problems
                            which confront the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Government and
                            people. Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_CM1">Chang Myon</persName>
                            has succeeded in consolidating a slim majority in Parliament and some
                            reforms have been accomplished. However, as the anniversary approaches,
                            there are mounting signs of frustration and resentment directed at the
                            government and, increasingly, at the US, over the slow pace of reform
                            and progress in South Korea. Public demonstrations, which succeeded so
                            well a year ago, have continued to mark the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> scene, especially in the nerve center of Seoul.
                            Although the tempo of demonstration activity declined somewhat during
                            the winter, there is a possibility that anniversary demonstrations will
                            erupt—by design or accident—and confront the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Government and the US with a major crisis in the next
                            month or so. This estimate seeks to assess the chances of such a crisis
                            and the conditions which might spark it.</p>
                        <p>II. The Possible Sources of Crisis</p>
                        <p>A. Political Weaknesses</p>
                        <p>3. The new government has indicated an awareness of basic problems and
                            has taken some steps to cope with them. Nevertheless, the seven months
                            of Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_CM1">Chang Myon</persName>'s
                            government, formed last autumn, have been expended largely in customary
                            Korean politicking, and the government's position is none too strong. In
                            the July 1960 elections, the ruling Democratic Party had won 174 of the
                            233 seats in the House of Representatives. However, the deep divisions
                            within the party <pb n="432" xml:id="pg_432" facs="0468"/>showed up
                            almost immediately and led to a prolonged struggle for party control.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CM1">Chang</persName> was confirmed as Prime
                            Minister by the House of Representatives only after Kim Toyon, a fellow
                            Democrat, had been nominated but rejected by a very narrow margin. The
                            faction led by <persName>Kim</persName> finally broke away completely,
                            formed the New Democratic Party, and is now the major opposition, with
                            about 61 adherents, in the House of Representatives. <persName corresp="#p_CM1">Chang</persName>'s Democratic Party has about 128
                            seats (117 are needed for a majority) and he can increase the number
                            slightly on certain issues by scattered support among the 37
                            independents in the House. However, potential schisms exist even within
                                <persName corresp="#p_CM1">Chang</persName>'s own Democratic Party,
                            the most significant being a group of 25-30 younger men who believe
                                <persName corresp="#p_CM1">Chang</persName>'s leadership is not
                            sufficiently imaginative or vigorous.</p>
                        <p>4. The opposition in Parliament is made up of the conservative New
                            Democratic Party, the independent group, and a few members of
                            left-of-center parties. The opposition has enjoyed the full exercise of
                            its constitutional rights of expression and parliamentary
                            interpellation. Though fragmented and divided, it has been highly vocal
                            and quick to take advantage of any opportunity to embarrass the
                            government and demand the resignation of individual cabinet members. The
                            opposition in Parliament is backed by a substantial segment of the press
                            which has taken advantage of the new freedom from censorship to indulge
                            in generally antigovernment, often irresponsible journalism. The
                            government has come under increasing criticism from student, labor,
                            veteran, and other groups as well, who feel that the reforms and
                            improvements which should have followed upon <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>'s expulsion have been all too slow in coming about.
                            Demonstrations and mass meetings have become a characteristic of Korean
                            public life over the past year.</p>
                        <p>5. In the past year the Communists have increased their efforts to
                            subvert the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>. North Korean broadcasts
                            aimed at the South have increased in number and intensity, and there has
                            been a greater North Korean effort of late to increase the influx of
                            subversive literature and support into the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>, largely by way of Japan. Some of the present political
                            unrest in the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> is almost certainly
                            attributable to Communist efforts. However, we believe that this unrest
                            for the most part would exist without Communist instigation.</p>
                        <p>6. The National Police and security services were a primary target of the
                            popular revulsion that led to last April's revolution. Since that time,
                            purges and reorganizations have gone on repeatedly, causing a serious
                            drop in the capabilities and morale of the police. Despite current
                            antiriot training, there is little likelihood that they could function
                            effectively against organized mass riots of the scale of 1960. In such
                            circumstances, the army would become the most important element in the
                            maintenance of order. We believe that the government would call on the
                                <pb n="433" xml:id="pg_433" facs="0469"/>army in an extreme
                            situation, and that the army would respond to the call but might be
                            reluctant to fire on demonstrators.</p>
                        <p>7. Public resentment over corrupt practices played an important part in
                            the making of the 1960 revolution. Corruption continues to be a major
                            problem for the government, although by itself it is not likely to cause
                            revolutionary action in present circumstances. Student groups in
                            particular have continued to lead the outcry against corruption.
                            Although Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_CM1">Chang</persName> and
                            the government generally have thus far escaped serious attack on this
                            score, petty graft at lower government and military levels and among
                            much of the public is as widespread as ever. The exposure of continuing
                            corruption in the police has caused new public concern over the issue
                            and forced the government to intensify its efforts to stamp it out.
                            Solution of the problem will be difficult, especially as long as civil
                            and military pay scales remain at their present low levels.</p>
                        <p>8. On balance, the <persName corresp="#p_CM1">Chang</persName> government
                            has achieved certain limited goals but has not sparked any broad degree
                            of public enthusiasm or support. As the government in power, it bears
                            responsibility for the absence of significant political or economic
                            advances. Well aware of increasing nationalist feeling, <persName corresp="#p_CM1">Chang</persName> has sought to avoid becoming too
                            closely identified with the US. This has been difficult, however, as the
                            government has recognized the necessity also of cooperating with the US
                            on the solution of its economic problems. Although the Korean public
                            probably does not regard <persName corresp="#p_CM1">Chang</persName> as
                            a US puppet, it almost certainly believes that, under his government,
                            the US has taken a more direct hand than previously in the conduct of
                            the government's economic affairs and that the US therefore shares
                            responsibility for existing economic conditions.</p>
                        <p>Economic Grievances</p>
                        <p>9. Underlying the political unrest in South Korea is the weak and
                            uncertain state of an economy poor in natural resources and diverted
                            from the major problems of reconstruction by the requirements of one of
                            the largest military establishments in proportion to population in the
                            entire world. Although the government's efforts at economic reform may
                            yield some long-term benefits, there has in general been no significant
                            improvement in the lot of the individual citizen since <persName corresp="#p_CM1">Chang</persName>'s government took power last
                            August. Indeed, some problems have become more serious.</p>
                        <p>10. The annual food shortage, which the rural areas normally experience
                            in April and May before the early planting is harvested, has already hit
                            many districts. There has been no starvation, but rations in many areas
                            have been sharply reduced. The urban population has been subjected to a
                            general rise in prices; in Seoul the wholesale price index rose by about
                            10 percent in January alone. This rise has slowed somewhat since, but
                            the Korean public remains apprehensive over continuing <pb n="434" xml:id="pg_434" facs="0470"/>inflationary trends. The situation has
                            already produced strikes, demonstrations, and petitions among the
                            laboring groups. There has been no improvement in the employment
                            situation, and unemployment and serious underemployment continue to
                            affect about 20 percent of the labor force. This number will soon be
                            swelled by most of this year's 45,000 college and vocational school
                            graduates. In seeking to fix responsibility, the Korean public, through
                            demonstrations and the press, blames not only the government but also,
                            to an increasing extent, the US. In particular, the upward push of
                            prices is ascribed to US-sponsored measures, namely the recent revision
                            of exchange rates and a 50 percent increase in utility rates now
                            awaiting enactment by the Parliament.</p>
                        <p>11. The <persName corresp="#p_CM1">Chang</persName> government is aware
                            of the dissatisfaction caused by the state of the economy and is making
                            efforts to remedy the situation. One important government measure is the
                            National Construction Service program, a large-scale public works
                            project being undertaken jointly with the US in an attempt to alleviate
                            unemployment, particularly in the outlying provinces. The recent
                            increase of US surplus food shipments has contributed to an easing of
                            hunger in the drought-hit districts in the south. <persName corresp="#p_CM1">Chang</persName> is hopeful that such measures will
                            at least tide the government over until longer term economic reforms
                            begin to take hold. Although these short-term measures will probably
                            have little practical effect on the economic situation within the period
                            of this estimate, they may have some beneficial psychological
                            result.</p>
                        <p>C. Grievances Against the US </p>
                        <p>12. The South Koreans have long resented the reluctance of the US to
                            conclude an administrative agreement providing for the legal status of
                            US armed forces in Korea. Under <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>, public expression on this subject was channeled
                            and controlled. Since his departure, public interest in such an
                            agreement has mounted greatly, in keeping with the general rise of
                            nationalist sentiment. The Koreans hold that whatever reason excused the
                            absence of a status of forces agreement in the past, the end of
                                <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> and the virtual
                            restoration of peacetime conditions—this latter recognized in the
                            conclusion of a US-<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> bilateral
                            economic aid agreement—no longer justify US reluctance to meet <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> desires on this issue. On 2 March 1961,
                            the Assembly unanimously passed a resolution urging “the earliest
                            conclusion” of such an agreement, and <persName corresp="#p_CM1">Chang</persName> has been urging on the US the immediate necessity
                            of such a step.</p>
                        <p>13. Considerable controversy developed over the bilateral economic aid
                            agreement. Opponents of the agreement alleged that, under it, the US was
                            “interfering” in the operations of the government, infringing Korean
                            sovereignty, and treating South Korea as a client state. In spite of
                            this charge, the measure was supported by a substantial majority in the
                            National Assembly. The US and the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            Government also continue to be criticized, sporadically, for being
                            “pro-Japanese.”</p>

                        <p>D. The Unification Issue</p>
                        <p>14. Although Korean unification has not become a burning issue, interest
                            in it has increased considerably over the past year, at least in part as
                            a consequence of dissatisfaction over conditions in the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>. Student groups have been in the
                            forefront of those calling for a re-examination of past stands and for
                            new initiatives to end the division of the country. The government
                            itself would like to take the propaganda initiative on unification from
                            North Korea but has put off any new action until after the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> consideration of the Korean question this
                            spring. The unification issue will almost certainly become an
                            increasingly serious problem for the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            and the US.</p>
                        <p>III. The Prospects for a Major Crisis</p>
                        <p>15. Combustible materials are present. Design, incident, or a combination
                            of accidents could ignite street demonstrations, converting them into
                            destructive mob action and a major crisis. The Communists would, of
                            course, exploit such an event. At a minimum, there will be considerable
                            noise over the next month or so. Some acts of violence are probable and
                            a major explosion of some kind is possible.</p>
                        <p>16. However, the odds appear to be against such an explosion this spring.
                            Despite the factors present which could spark a new revolution, the
                            situation in April 1961 is different in many respects from that of April
                            1960. Present frustrations are not as severe as those so long suppressed
                            by <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>. Moreover, although
                            demonstrators may once again take to the streets, there is at present no
                            single, emotion-packed focus for discontent comparable to last year's
                            election frauds and police brutality. Finally, the government is alert
                            to the danger and has publicized its preparations for coping with
                            disturbances.</p>
                        <p>17. In any event, South Korea's fundamental problems will continue to
                            plague any <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> leadership. Faced with an
                            impoverished economy, drained by defense costs, and handicapped by
                            inexperience in self-government, South Korea will remain heavily
                            dependent on outside economic and military assistance for the
                            foreseeable future. There will, moreover, be increasing political
                            pressures arising out of growing nationalist spirit and incipient
                            neutralist sentiment. In short, South Korea is basically so weak
                            economically and unsteady politically that internal crisis or threat of
                            crisis will be the norm, not the exception, over the years ahead.</p>

                            youth and intelligentsia most Asian countries are in no mood in latter
                            20th Century to continue stomaching “typically Asian” accommodation to
                            graft, nepotism and apathy of past centuries; and history has shown that
                            they are more ready to accept the high costs in human values exacted by
                            communism (even when these are understood fully, and all the more when
                            they are not) then we tend to find credible before the fact. When
                            sufficiently revolted by apathetic drifting and by illegal gains for the
                            elite, the totalitarian aspects of communism appear less fearsome and
                            its austerity and determined purposes may become positively attractive,
                            in the hunger for national material progress leading, they hope, to
                            national dignity at last. You will be able to draw on your uncommonly
                            thorough knowledge of the antecedents to the China mainland collapse in
                            developing this troublingly recurrent theme in post-war Asian realities.
                            Unfortunately we are having similar problems in Laos, Viet-Nam, and in
                            varying degrees elsewhere. US wealth and military might will prove
                            unavailing in situations where indigenous motivation is weak and
                            governmental actions and self-discipline desultory. Repose of many
                                <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> mainland leaders in childish
                            confidence that “our friend, the great US cannot afford to let the
                            communists take China” comes to mind.</p>
                        <p>Department hopes that in final talks with <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> leaders you will make occasion for earnest, unhurried
                            exposition of above theme, adapted as you deem most effective and
                            appropriate. We offer below additional points directed more specifically
                            to Korean scene. It is recognized that you have made frequent
                            representations along these lines, but it may be helpful to cite
                            Washington view to lend additional emphasis to seriousness of need for
                            far more resolute leadership in national development if disaster is to
                            be averted in next few years or sooner. Your new position should add
                            considerable weight to the seriousness of your presentations. While we
                            deal below primarily with deficiencies, Department <pb n="437" xml:id="pg_437" facs="0473"/>does not overlook positive
                            contributions which Chang government has made and are well known to you.
                            You will wish to interlard these, but restrainedly.</p>
                        <p>1. <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> seems unduly concerned with
                            press reactions and postures taken by elements in Korean political scene
                            which deserve examination ascertain whether they are still of
                            importance. Too often it seems here that Chang Govt has plotted its
                            course from old landmarks which are no longer controlling and has failed
                            to recognize the commanding importance of youthful element in the
                            political spectrum which accomplished the April revolution and gave the
                            new <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> power to move in an area
                            formerly completely stratified. Thus bemused <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> may overlook salient fact that it must make some
                            visible progress toward the improvement of life and prospects of the
                            youthful element in Korea and their descendants if Administration is to
                            remain in power. Otherwise it might be replaced by some political
                            element equally myopic which if in turn thrown out could leave a highly
                            volatile dangerous situation in which the appeal of unification of the
                            country might be so great as to tempt the South Korean people to enter
                            the Communist crab pot.</p>
                        <p>2. It must be recognized that with principal exception of National
                            Construction Service, actions so far have generally been removal of past
                            abuses. But even the Construction Service is in urgent need, not only of
                            funds (which may be voted this weekend), but of good planning and
                            energetic follow-through. This imaginative and obviously useful program
                            is of type to win popular support for <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> and to meet in a tangible way demands of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> unemployed and underemployed for some
                            progress toward a better life and better use of human resources which
                            comprise <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> greatest asset. Its
                            resolute implementation will benefit all Koreans through irrigation,
                            reclamation, reforestation, highway construction, etc. Its failure will
                            only heighten public sense of frustration and weaken confidence in the
                            effectiveness of the revolutionary government.</p>
                        <p>3. Department notes mounting signs of frustration and resentment directed
                            at government,and at US as well, over slow pace of reform and progress.
                            Apparent acceptance by <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> of
                            legislative practice of politics-as-usual feeds fires of press and
                            popular criticism and tends undermine faith in democratic mechanisms for
                            national development. We do not believe that <persName corresp="#p_CM1">Chang</persName> government will fail survive critical month ahead,
                            but we are convinced that its strength will be eroded unless it adopts
                            programs and policies which can command general support of people and
                            pursues them with energy, thereby turning the tables on the venal,
                            malicious, or ambitious opposition it presently faces in the legislature
                            and in its own party.</p>
                        <p>4. In Washington view recent attempt to widen National Security Law is
                            symptomatic of negative approach to present danger—an <pb n="438" xml:id="pg_438" facs="0474"/>approach which will create more
                            problems that it solves. What Korea needs is informed, cohesive society
                            moving in agreed directions toward defined goals. Social discipline and
                            order comes from basic convictions and understanding of men; laws and
                            regulations are of no value without broad popular support and effective
                            social agencies to apply and enforce them.</p>
                        <p>5. US believes that following points demand immediate attention and

                            possible extent in planning and implementation and also recognizes that
                            as Korean War era recedes into history US programs must put far more
                            emphasis on development. Nevertheless initiative in planning and
                            implementation must come from Korean leadership if it is to be
                            meaningful for Korean people. <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> will
                            continue support for Korean economic and political development and looks
                            forward to continuation this cordial relationship in future and to
                            steadily increasing effectiveness of <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> in directing and promoting national development to
                            meet popular aspirations for well-being, security and freedom. In last
                            analysis the future of Korea as reunified and sovereign member of Free
                            World community depends upon success of national leadership in bringing
                            about this development. Assistance from other nations can supplement but
                            never replace progress of Korean people themselves and can be effective
                            only when such progress is being made.</p>

                        <p>I talked this morning with the Korean desk officer in State, <persName corresp="#p_MDDS1">Donald Macdonald</persName>, in an informal
                            effort to learn something of the status of work on Korea. He has
                            impressed me in the past as a very able officer. He indicated that he is
                            presently working on a paper which is intended for you. It will deal
                            with the question of what should be done about Korea's economic
                            situation and will contain an analysis of Mr. Farley's political
                            conclusions.</p>
                        <p>He said that he did not know the exact status of the recommendation for a
                            special mission to Korea which was being handled elsewhere in the
                            Department. He was himself very much in favor of such a mission but
                            feared that the idea, after starting “in a burst of glory,” was now
                            being downgraded. Everyone concerned with Korean problems agreed that
                            some such action was needed. The psychology that had guided U.S. aid
                            programs in Korea since 1945 had been one which emphasized stopgaps. If
                            there was famine you provided food, but you didn't look beyond that to
                            what you should do about the food problem. The Koreans themselves now
                            recognize that this is an inadequate approach and are receptive to
                            change. Through no fault of any particular individual, our aid mission
                            in Korea had been characterized by too many indians, too few chiefs.
                            There were too many people in Korea and they were of the wrong kind. The
                            mission was characterized by too much concern with bureaucracy and petty
                            detail, too little with the larger aspects of the program.</p>
                        <p>An adequate approach to the problem would have three characteristics:</p>
                        <p>a. A special mission to Korea made up of really able people. The people
                            sent should have real ability and prestige. We should not send retired
                            businessmen, but people who are equipped by background for a rapid
                            insight into Korea's political and economic problems. I inferred that he
                            thought that present planning in State was inadequate in this
                            respect.</p>
                        <p>b. Provision should be made for follow-through on the special mission's
                            recommendations. This was a defect of the Farley proposals; that <pb n="440" xml:id="pg_440" facs="0476"/>he made no recommendations for
                            bringing people in with the special mission who would stay on and see
                            that recommendations are carried out.</p>
                        <p>c. A smaller group of higher-level people was needed to run the aid
                            program in Korea.</p>
                        <p>He indicated that he thought that an inquiry by you as to the status of
                            planning for a special mission would be highly desirable.</p>
                        <p>In view of the character of some of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MDDS1">Macdonald</persName>'s comments, they should obviously be treated
                            confidentially.</p>

                                also stated that, if the Department of State insisted on initiating

                                    Bundy</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName>, March 27; ibid.)</note> US Government is
                            under Congressional mandate to insure that US personnel subject to the
                            jurisdiction of foreign courts will be assured fair trial guarantees
                            comparable to those which would obtain in trials before US courts. Of
                            necessity, this entails a study of the host state judicial system which
                            the US has done in all countries where its personnel are subject to
                            local jurisdiction and which it has undertaken with respect to Korea.
                            When results of Korean law study are known, we will then be able to
                            determine on what basis a solution to the criminal jurisdiction problem
                            might be possible. Since all systems of criminal law are not identical,
                            it may be necessary to take special steps to provide the assurances
                            which we would require. <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>. As a result
                            of the Chinese law study, we found it necessary to include fair trial
                            guarantees additional to those found in the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_SOF1">SOF</gloss> which the Chinese have informally
                            implied might require certain revisions to their legal system. End
                                <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>. Unless arrangements can be
                            worked out which would ensure that US personnel would be assured of
                            trials comparable to US standards, no agreement on criminal jurisdiction
                            can be reached.</p>
                        <p>In addition, Ambassador should also indicate to PriMin that under any
                            arrangements concerning criminal jurisdiction we consider it essential
                            that in actual practice the US exercise jurisdiction over our forces in
                            the maximum number of cases, since we believe such course will best
                            promote continued cordial <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>-US
                            relations.</p>
                        <p>As to agenda and negotiating tactics, we have no objection to suggestion
                            reftel that such aspects as entry and exit, customs, duties and taxation
                            be negotiated first, although we see no reason why these subjects could
                            not be handled simultaneously. While we recognize that <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> desire for some compensation could
                            make facilities and areas agreement difficult and controversial, we
                            believe that question could logically be separated from other elements
                            of such agreement, especially if <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss>
                            aware we prepared to proceed in due course on criminal jurisdiction. We
                            expect to have draft of proposed facilities and areas agreement
                            (excluding any provision for compensation of property claims) ready for
                            transmittal soonest.</p>

                        <p>Since rentals and criminal jurisdiction are clearly principal issues as
                            far as <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Government and public are
                            concerned, we do not believe it in our best interest to postpone

                            popular pressures on <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> in meantime.
                            Now that we have decided negotiate full <gloss target="#t_SOFA1">SOFA</gloss> we believe best course of action is to proceed with

                            for. Moreover, these measures, taken as a whole and particularly in

                            imposed short-term hardships and inevitable popular reactions which ROKG
                            and ROK-US relations had to weather.</p>
                        <p>Rigors of these accomplishments put our relationships and ROK
                            constitutional system to new trial and highlighted question of ROK
                            sovereignty and question of US respect for <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> sovereignty. <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            sensitivities particularly stirred up as result of conclusion by end of
                            February of new bilateral aid agreement which somewhat irrationally
                            regarded by <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s as derogatory of their
                            sovereignty and language of which gave considerable offense. Incident
                            brought out fact that nationalism in Korea, delayed by war and
                            reconstruction, now becoming an important factor in Korean life.
                            Moreover, pressures on ROKs to normalize aid procedures and economic
                            relationships with US gave new prominence to status of force question on
                            which no action was taken.</p>
                        <p>Yet our general approach of holding out additional assistance to <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> only in return for <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> compliance with specific conditions
                            seems to have been highly successful in achieving results we had sought
                            unavailingly for years. Question arises therefore how in period of
                            rising nationalism and of perhaps declining overall US assistance US can
                            nevertheless pursue same general tactic as reflected in <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> letter, exerting greater
                            influence on <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s to place their house
                            in order. Tremendous tasks lie ahead, including spurring economic
                            development, eliminating corruption, promoting the austerity movement,
                            etc., without taking steps which involve “interference” from US, these
                            things likely not to be done in time, yet if we overplay our hand and
                            stir up serious <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> resentment, our
                            efforts could be dangerously counter-productive.</p>
                        <pb n="444" xml:id="pg_444" facs="0480"/>
                        <p>Basic answer lies in being firm in our councils, yet never treating
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s as less than equal, of
                            consulting them properly on international issues, and of maintaining
                            sympathetic understanding for a nation which has gone through great
                            agony, remains divided, and has enormous economic and political
                            problems. <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s are tested friends
                            looking to US leadership and guidance but not wishing to be reminded of
                            dependency on US. In present nationalistic setting, bringing our
                            influence to bear more effectively on <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> will take some doing. Answer would seem to lie in
                            exerting more influence by doing it less conspicuously. Aware of this
                            problem for some time, Embassy has already devised many techniques for
                            quietly influencing legislators and <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> executive branch. More and more and more meetings with
                            PriMin have been held without knowledge of press through rendezvous at
                            my home or elsewhere. Visits to Korea of influential US officials would
                            be helpful in this regard, assuming, of course, that our counsels would
                            be discreetly conveyed; and visits to US of key <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> officials (like FinMin <persName>Kim</persName> last
                            fall) should be utilized to maximum effect. Above all, it will require
                            hard, sustained efforts applied widely but with the ultimate in
                            diplomacy, tact and patience.</p>
                        <p>(2) How to make the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> democratic system
                            more effective?</p>
                        <p>Here I feel we must do more to influence PriMin <persName corresp="#p_CM1">Chang Myon</persName> to exercise leadership—an
                            ingredient definitely lacking at present in Korean political scene. He
                            is no dynamic leader by nature and it will be difficult to alter this
                            style which reflects PriMin's own personality and character. However, we
                            should continue to urge that PriMin act decisively to get through
                            important bills or act on other needed measures, bearing in mind that
                            when he has acted in a forthright, forceful way, results have been good
                            for country and party. This is not to suggest that he should act
                            autocratically or without proper consultation with opposition. Indeed
                            one of his faults has been failure on occasion to prepare groundwork for
                            more expeditious legislative action through adequate consultation with
                            opposition leaders as well as elements his own party.</p>
                        <p>Particularly in these challenging times, PriMin and his cohorts cannot
                            afford to act in politics-as-usual manner. They should recognize that
                            semi-emergency times call for statesmanship, greater unity and concerted
                            effort.</p>
                        <p>We have also counselled PriMin—although he seems to have been
                            unresponding so far and therefore our counsels should perhaps be more
                            strongly accentuated—to get out among his own people, to break free from
                            the chrysalis of Seoul politics and identify himself as the kind of
                            leader of the people who understands their problems and spearheads their
                            interests. For example, PriMin and Cabinet members never visited areas
                            reported to be suffering from famine during past several months.</p>
                        <pb n="445" xml:id="pg_445" facs="0481"/>
                        <p>We would also hope to induce PriMin to show better judgment in some of
                            his appointments, notably in the diplomatic field, and to show greater
                            disposition for drawing younger leaders into top positions—particularly
                            younger leaders pledged to integrity and austerity in Korean life. In
                            latter regard, pervading effects of oriental family system and
                            traditional respect for elders is going to make it difficult to achieve
                            quick progress in having wider, more influential participation of
                            younger leaders in politics, business and society. Nevertheless, it is
                            apparent that there is sharp divergency between the convictions,
                            training and values of the Korean under thirty as compared with his
                            elders. It is obviously to our advantage that these younger elements be
                            able make their contributions through the established conservative
                            political parties. We should not try to force them into a premature
                            prominence but we should be alert for opportunities to assist them to
                            gain experience and public recognition. The emergence of such younger
                            elements might also provide a factor which at present time is sadly
                            lacking in Korea, i.e. a group which knows that a modern state can limit
                            graft and corruption in both govt and business and that South Korea can
                            hardly hope survive unless it does take such measures.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, we must discourage any <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss>
                            tendency to rely on repression as means of retaining power. While there
                            is need for tightening up security laws in Korea, communism and leftism
                            will be far more effectively counteracted by positive measures to
                            improve national wellbeing (such as National Construction Service) than
                            by anti-Communist laws. Accent must be upon the positive, not upon the
                            negative. Korea must be made to look forward rather than backward.</p>
                        <p>(3) How to inculcate greater hope among <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> in their own future and greater mutual trust and
                            confidence among themselves?</p>
                        <p>I am increasingly persuaded that this is the basic psychological problem
                            here. Stark, bleak facts of economic life and frustrations over
                            continued divisions of Korea are prominent among factors explaining
                            widespread feelings of hopelessness in future, continuing mutual
                            recriminations among Koreans who as a people have been traditionally
                            addicted to distrust of fellowman, and all this creates an atmosphere
                            wide open to exploitation by enemies of a free Korea. To overcome this
                            deeply disturbing state of national mind involves improvement of
                            conditions of life and closing the widening gap between <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> expectations and the actual rate of
                            progress toward those aspirations.</p>
                        <p>A carefully conceived and rigorously pursued long-range economic
                            development plan is an absolute necessity, providing not only the
                            blueprint for action but also the grounds for hope and a sense of
                            achievement that would go with the formulation and execution of such a
                            program. <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> increasingly aware of

                            recent announcement of proposal to give US economic aid programs on
                            long-term basis for economic development purposes and in harmony with
                            recipient countries on long-range development programs. This
                            announcement in itself injected a new ray of hope in <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> community.</p>

                            Korea which I believe it will be, its continuation should be encouraged

                        <p>Japan, longtime and natural trading partner of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>, offers great possibilities for developmental aid to
                            Korea—at least in form of long-term investment loans—and for furnishing
                            technological assistance which Korea eminently requires. Recent efforts
                            of Italian and German private interests (backed by their respective
                            govts) to enter Korean development with long-term credits for industrial
                            projects have been welcomed by <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> and
                            should be encouraged by US. On other hand, although <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> foreign investment law has now been in
                            effect for over 15 months, there has been no rush of foreign private
                            investors to Korea and not one capital investment project has actually
                            been initiated under this law. Since the law itself appears to provide
                            adequate safeguards for investment, political and social instability
                            seem to be main inhibiting factors.</p>
                        <p>Also needed to counteract lack of faith and hope among Koreans is more
                            responsible press and a far better govt information service. We are
                            working hard in encouraging progress in these fields. Press, of course,
                            responds best to advice from newspaper contacts from abroad. A recent
                            letter from <gloss target="#t_IPI1">IPI</gloss> Director criticizing
                            Korean press irresponsibility had deep impact. This kind of approach
                            should be repeated.</p>

                            current ROK-GOJ talks is not soon forthcoming, I believe we should
                            consider whether US taking more active role in trying to induce
                            settlement might not be less risky than permitting situation continue to
                            drift. There may be temptation to transfer this middleman responsibility
                            to another third party such as ICJ or neutral group but it is doubtful
                            that any outside group could be as efficacious in bringing <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss>

                        <p>So much for the four main questions emerging from events of past few
                            months. Additional to these and to recommendations contained in reftel,
                            I feel that there are two basic problems which have received inadequate
                            attention and need redressing. I refer to problem of excessive
                            population growth and to problem of excessive numbers of unemployed
                            college graduates. These phenomena, if unmitigated, are going to be
                            dangerously compromising to the viability, stability and security of
                            free Korea. Korea would do well to examine and emulate, as valid and
                            desirable, family planning methods being pursued in India and elsewhere.
                            High literacy and educational system in Korea furnish useful background
                            in this regard. As to unemployed graduates of higher institutes, I
                            believe we should exert influence to encourage more vocational technical
                            and scientific training at expense of liberal arts and law, plus higher
                            entrance and graduation requirements for college students.</p>
                        <p>In relinquishing my duties here, I wish to thank those many able
                            colleagues of all US agencies represented in Seoul who, reinforced by
                            excellent guidance and backstopping from Dept and other agencies in
                            Washington, are so effectively promoting US interests in this strategic
                            peninsula.</p>

                            the Treasury, and State, and the Central Intelligence Agency. <persName corresp="#p_BAAA1">Burke</persName> also noted that Under Secretary

                            concern reportedly expressed by the President was that the Korea Task
                            Force study should be “focused on important problems and should propose

At this

                        <p>2.(C) General <persName corresp="#p_CM1">Chang</persName> stated that the
                            coup was led by Maj General Pak Jung Hui and that also involved were
                            elements of the 1st Marine brigade from Kimpo Peninsula, the 30th, 31st,

                            Brigade of Kimpo peninsula started north across the Soul Han River
                            bridge where a fire fight developed with <gloss target="#t_ROKA1">ROKA</gloss> MPs. It later developed that the battalion was led by

                            judicial branches of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Government.
                            The action was taken to terminate corruption and overcome the difficult
                            situation facing the nation. The committee promised that the new

                            (3) observe the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter and all
                            international agreements and cooperation with the US and all other free
                            nations, (4) endeavor to stabilize the national economy, (5) unify Korea
                            as an anti-Communist nation, and (6) turn over the reins of government
                                <pb n="450" xml:id="pg_450" facs="0486"/>to “honest and competent

                            approximately 0630 hours. At this time <persName corresp="#p_CM1">Chang</persName> gave Gen <persName corresp="#p_MBGCB1">Magruder</persName> the impression that he was not a party to the
                            revolution, but desired to negotiate with the revolutionaries to prevent
                            bloodshed. <persName corresp="#p_CM1">Chang</persName> stated he wished
                            to talk to military cmdrs to get assurance they would back him in
                            opposing revolution. He was reluctant to call in <gloss target="#t_ROKA1">ROKA</gloss> troops.</p>

                            operate through the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Government.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CM1">Chang</persName> requested Pak to make
                            his demands known to the government.</p>
                        <p>8.(C) <persName corresp="#p_CM1">Chang</persName> indicated to Gen

                            the President to declare martial law with <persName corresp="#p_CM1">Chang</persName> as martial law cmdr thus enhancing Chang's
                            position vis-a-vis Pak.</p>

                            were called upon to put down the insurrection, there might be a few who
                            would not fight the insurrectionists, but most would. Gen Lee has
                            alerted certain troops for possible movement. <gloss target="#t_FROKA1">FROKA</gloss> has not been alerted.</p>

                            martial law to be established in Korea and that he does not desire any
                            firm action to eliminate the revolutionary movement. The Minister of

                            made no attempt either assist or interfere with coup operations. First

                            present Chief of Staff Gen Chang To-yong seems equivocal. He has
                            reportedly declined call on other <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            Army units to put down coup, presumably on ground this would cause
                            considerable bloodshed. On other hand Gen <persName corresp="#p_CM1">Chang</persName> has apparently not cast his lot with coup group.
                            Latter's use of Gen <persName corresp="#p_CM1">Chang</persName>'s name
                            as coup leader appears unauthorized and incorrect.</p>

                            alertness, initiative and timeliness characteristic of your
                            reporting.</p>
                        <p>We recognize desirability of restoring authority of lawful government
                            against reckless challenge of military clique invoking force to upset
                            government freely chosen by Korean people under their own constitutional
                            system. Even though no ideological issue apparently involved, our
                            assessment is that coup attempt undermines stability and reputation of
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> and therefore is contrary to our
                            joint interests.</p>
                        <p>However, the strange unwillingness of the President, armed forces leaders
                            and other key officials to take any action to suppress coup or to take
                            sides at all, with disappearance from public view of Prime Minister and
                            other members of Cabinet, does not encourage view that Chang government
                            can survive crisis unscathed. Irresolution of those officials who have
                            it in their power to deal with uprising and apparent indifference
                            general public to fate of Chang government provide poor foundation for

                            clarification of situation. We will continue to hope Government can
                            reestablish itself and we will avoid any action which would adversely
                            affect its prospects. On the other hand, in absence some indication
                            government able and willing put forth some effective effort save itself,
                            we will refrain from additional public identification of U.S. with fate
                            of what may be a lost cabinet.<note n="1" xml:id="d216fn1">The following

                            Definite threat exists; however, increased political stability, absence
                            of violence and civil disorder and strengthening of the police would
                            tend to thwart any coup attempt.</p>

                            that a significant grouping exists which is actively and seriously
                            talking and planning a coup and that the grouping is largely made up of
                            elements which are bitter, rash, purposeful and quite capable of abrupt
                            and violent action.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_CM1">Chang</persName> that information on coup
                            had been volunteered our office, that General <persName corresp="#p_MBGCB1">Magruder</persName> would be advised at first

                        <p>26 April—Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_CM1">Chang Myon</persName>
                            is aware of rumors circulating to the effect that a group of malcontents
                            within the Army may be plotting some kind of coup. He attaches little
                            importance to these stories and believes that the situation is by no
                            means dangerous. <persName corresp="#p_CM1">Chang Myon</persName> is

                            Army Chief of Staff Chang To-yong. He believes that General <persName corresp="#p_CM1">Chang</persName> is forceful and able and enjoys
                            the respect of his American counterparts. He plans to retain General

                            personal summary of the situation after the first twenty four hours is
                            set forth below.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister continues to remain in hiding and does not reveal
                            himself to us. He does not have a reputation for personal courage.</p>
                        <p>The strength behind the military coup is still unclear but appears to be
                            growing. Only a few troops have moved into Seoul, probably about 3600.
                            They have been essentially unopposed. More have not been needed so we
                            cannot be sure whether more are available. The troops actually available
                            and those reported to be available come from Korean reserve and corps
                            artillery units under the operational control of the US I Corps
                            Group.</p>
                        <p>A US Army <gloss target="#t_CIC1">CIC</gloss> poll of casual bystanders
                            along the streets indicates an average for each ten questioned of four
                            in favor of the uprising, two in favor but consider timing too early,
                            and four opposed.</p>
                        <p>I am not fully confident in the loyalty of the <persName corresp="#p_CM1">Chang Myun</persName> government of any of the chiefs of staff.
                            Chairman of <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> Kim Chong Oh appears to
                            be neutral with some leaning toward loyalty but exercises little
                            influence. Kim Shin, Lee Sung Ho and Kim Sung Eun appear to be
                            neutral.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CYCDY1">Chang Do Young</persName> has represented
                            himself as loyal but claimed that he did not take decisive action
                            because he wished to avoid bloodshed. There is much to indicate he is
                            two faced. He is in a state of mental depression which makes it
                            particularly hard to analyze his actions. He is unwilling to bring
                            troops even to the outskirts of Seoul. He had at least some previous
                            knowledge of the uprising. In the propaganda of the insurgents he was
                            cited as the head of the Revolutionary Committee. He said he was not but
                            he was unwilling to deny it publicly. He has now accepted this position
                            for the purpose (so he states) of securing authority to move the
                            insurgent troops out of Seoul.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_YP1">Yun Po Sun</persName> while giving
                            lip service to the constitution initially, appeared to consider a coup
                            as an acceptable method of getting rid of his political opponent
                                <persName corresp="#p_CM1">Chang Myun</persName> and establishing a
                            new kind of government. He still probably wants to replace <persName corresp="#p_CM1">Chang Myun</persName> and seems <pb n="459" xml:id="pg_459" facs="0495"/>to be seeking most legally correct way
                            of achieving this. Both President <persName corresp="#p_YP1">Yun</persName> and Chairman of the House of Councillors George Paik
                            oppose bringing in troops to suppress the uprising.</p>
                        <p>I have not seen the <gloss target="#t_MND1">MND</gloss> who is confined
                            in the City Hall by the insurgents but <persName corresp="#p_CYCDY1">Chang Do Young</persName> stated he urged no troops be brought in
                            to quell the uprising lest there be bloodshed.</p>
                        <p>In summary all the powerful men in and around the Seoul government appear
                            to have had knowledge of the plan for the coup and at least have not
                            opposed it. The people appear to be divided for and against but they do
                            not appear to be sufficiently concerned at this time to take any active
                            part.</p>
                        <p>The basic purpose of the uprising appears to be the elimination of the
                                <persName corresp="#p_CM1">Chang Myun</persName> government and
                            probably the elimination of the cabinet responsive system. There has
                            been no evidence of anti-American or pro-Communist feeling. The actual
                            leader is Major General Pak Chong Hui, a forceful officer tainted in the
                            past with Communism and who was convicted by the <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> government as a Communist.
                            Subsequently he collaborated with the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> in eliminating some Communists. Since that time he has
                            a reputation of being anti-Communist. There appear to be no known
                            Communists among the other members of the coup group nor are there any
                            who are known to be anti-American. It must be realized that if the coup
                            is permitted to be successful, Pak, whose real loyalty remains to be
                            determined, may emerge as the most powerful man in Korea.</p>
                        <p>The insurgents have possession of the radio stations and have a
                            censorship on the press. They are broadcasting propaganda and
                            suppressing everything unfavorable to their cause. Given time, this may
                            convert many individuals who up to now have been neutral into supporters
                            of the uprising.</p>
                        <p>On the advice of General Lee Han Lim in order to help hold the First
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Army in line and in an effort to
                            stop all the neutrals from going over to the insurgents I have broadcast
                            my support of the constitutionally elected government as has Charge
                            d'Affaires Marshall <persName corresp="#p_GM1">Green</persName>. This
                            appears to have had some effect but it can not be expected to endure
                            indefinitely. However, at minimum, it will emphasize need to return to
                            civilian, legally constituted government as soon as possible.</p>
                        <p>We are seeking to undermine the uprising by pressing the responsible
                            commanders, from whose commands came the insurgent troops now in Seoul,
                            to endeavor to get their troops to return to their duty. Success appears
                            probable with the Marine Battalion. It appears improbable with the
                            artillery battalion of the VI <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Corps.
                            Other troops are still in doubt.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_CM1">Chang</persName>, in his presumably
                            new position as Martial Law Commander, states that he will order the
                            insurgent troops out of Seoul. If <pb n="460" xml:id="pg_460" facs="0496"/>they go under these circumstances it will presumably be
                            with some assurance that the <persName corresp="#p_CM1">Chang
                                Myun</persName> government will be replaced although the insurgents
                            have not made known whatever demands they have. The replacement of the
                                <persName corresp="#p_CM1">Chang Myun</persName> government is the
                            publicly stated reason for the uprising.</p>
                        <p> Lee Han Lim and his First <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Army are
                            the force which can probably suppress the uprising by bringing to Seoul
                            such an overwhelming force as to make it hopeless for the insurgents to
                            fight. General Lee states that his troops, with few exceptions, will do
                            as they are ordered. He has four Divisions now in reserve alerted. I
                            believe he would accept and carry out instructions if they were given by
                                <persName corresp="#p_CM1">Chang Myun</persName> to suppress the
                            uprising. I believe he would accept and carry out such instructions if
                            given by me. The longer the above action is delayed the less likely is
                            the prospect of success.</p>
                        <p>I have hoped that <persName corresp="#p_CM1">Chang Myun</persName> would
                            reveal his whereabouts last night but it is now 0900 <gloss target="#t_KST1">KST</gloss> and he has not yet done so. Some of his
                            people have been contacted but none admit knowing where he is. We urged
                            to have him get in touch with us but he has not responded.</p>
                        <p>If the Prime Minister will assert himself and direct the use of <gloss target="#t_FROKA1">FROKA</gloss> to suppress the uprising I propose
                            to support him. Unless and until he does, I will seek to hold <gloss target="#t_FROKA1">FROKA</gloss> available for use. I do not know
                            how long I can hold <gloss target="#t_FROKA1">FROKA</gloss> in this
                            situation available to support <persName corresp="#p_CM1">Chang

                            Minister remains in hiding the less are his chances of returning to
                            power.</p>
                        <p>A possible course of action is for me to direct Lee Han Lim to suppress
                            the uprising even though the President, the Chairman of the House of
                            Councillors, the <gloss target="#t_MND1">MND</gloss> and the CS <gloss target="#t_ROKA1">ROKA</gloss> oppose use of the <gloss target="#t_FROKA1">FROKA</gloss> for this purpose. If I should do so
                            and were successful we might restore a government with no one to run it
                            and lacking popular support. Basically my mission is to protect Korea
                            from external aggression. To this end the Korean Forces appear to be
                            steadfast. I feel that it is also a part of my mission to protect Korea
                            from internal subversion by the Communists. The uprising does not appear
                            to be Communist inspired although the leader is a former Communist and
                            any uprising against the duly elected government may react to the
                            advantage of the Communists. Accordingly, I do not propose to direct
                                <gloss target="#t_FROKA1">FROKA</gloss> to suppress the uprising on
                            my own authority only.</p>

                            of support I should give the Prime Minister if he comes out of hiding. I
                            visualize the support I would propose to give as my personally urging

                        <p>If it is your finding that <persName corresp="#p_CM1">Chang
                                Myon</persName> government has disintegrated irretrievably you are
                            authorized to work along lines which you consider best calculated to
                            encourage early emergence of broadly based, responsible non-partisan
                            government of national unity and of predominantly civilian composition
                            with which we can work constructively and cooperatively in atmosphere of
                            mutual trust. While Revolutionary Committee as presently constituted may
                            appear to offer scant promise of developing in this direction, you are
                            authorized in your discretion to work as you deem necessary with that
                            Committee as starting point, seeking to bring to bear all available
                            moderating, balancing and restraining influences. Possible utility of
                            General Lee Han Lim, Commander First <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            Army, in this connection might be considered.</p>
                        <pb n="462" xml:id="pg_462" facs="0498"/>
                        <p>It is highly important to confer on successor government to maximum
                            attainable extent an aura of legality, continuity and legitimate
                            constitutional succession. Presumably this can best be achieved by
                            continuation in office of <persName corresp="#p_YP1">Yun Po
                                Sun</persName> as President who would use his prestige and office to
                            bring about selection of generally acceptable candidate for Prime
                            Minister.</p>
                        <p>It our tentative impression here that coup group has no very clear idea
                            exactly where it wants to go after having overthrown Chang government.
                            If this impression correct and <persName corresp="#p_YP1">Yun Po
                                Sun</persName> willing assert leadership inherent in his office at
                            such period of crisis, suggest possibility of Yun calling in coup group
                            leaders together with a few widely respected military and civilian
                            figures of national stature and attempting obtain immediate agreement on
                            selection Prime Minister and full cabinet slate who could reassert
                            governmental authority. Even though such action may not be possible
                            strictly within constitutional framework seems from here some such
                            action within spirit orderly governmental processes might offer best
                            hope of preventing degeneration into chaotic situation which communists
                            might attempt to exploit or into out-and-out military dictatorship. This
                            offered only as suggested line of approach within foregoing framework.
                            There may well be other such lines not apparent to us here.</p>
                        <p>If in your judgment situation calls for radically different approach, you
                            should outline it soonest for our urgent consideration.<note n="2" xml:id="d219fn2">In telegram 1579 from Seoul, May 19, <persName corresp="#p_GM1">Green</persName> proposed to enter into

                        <p>On the morning of May 15 during the early hours of the Korean coup,
                            General <persName corresp="#p_MBGCB1">Carter Magruder</persName>,
                            Commander in Chief, <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Command, Republic
                            of Korea, issued a statement calling on all military personnel under his
                            command to support the Government of the Republic of Korea headed by
                            Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_CM1">Chang Myon</persName> and
                            restore order in the Korean armed forces. This statement was made in
                            collaboration with our Charge d'Affaires, Marshall <persName corresp="#p_GM1">Green</persName>, whose parallel statement fully
                            concurred in General <persName corresp="#p_MBGCB1">Magruder</persName>'s
                            position and emphasized that the United States supports the
                            constitutional government of the Republic of Korea as elected by the
                            Korean people and duly constituted under legal procedures.<note n="1" xml:id="d220fn1">See <ref target="#d213">Document 213</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>These statements were not authorized in advance by the Department of
                            State; but in the Korean context, they were justified as affirmations of
                            established policy for the purpose of strengthening and maintaining
                            democratic institutions. The United States enjoys an unusual role in
                            Korea because of our long association with the country as liberator,
                            defender, and source of economic and military support. The Korean people
                            and government, since the founding of the Republic, have continued to
                            look to the United States for guidance in hours of crisis. Public
                            statements by our Embassy at Seoul during the April 1960 revolution were
                            extremely important in preventing further bloodshed during the student
                            demonstrations and preparing for an orderly transfer of power from the
                                <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> administration to that of
                            the interim government under Korean constitutional procedures. The
                            Department of State believes that it is especially important that the
                            Republic of Korea maintain its adherence to democratic procedures and
                            constitutional processes, which are among the Republic's chief assets in
                            its struggle against Communism. In these circumstances, it was a proper
                            decision to throw our influence on the side of the legitimate
                            government, in the belief that the domestic forces supporting this
                            government would be strengthened. Not to have done so would have
                            strengthened the revolutionists' hand.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_MBGCB1">Magruder</persName> has also
                            informed us that his statement and that of the Charge d'Affaires were
                            made on the advice of General Lee Han <pb n="464" xml:id="pg_464" facs="0500"/>Lim in order to help hold the First <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Army in its position on the demarcation
                            line and in an effort to prevent those neutrally inclined from joining
                            the insurgents' case. General <persName corresp="#p_MBGCB1">Magruder</persName> has noted that these statements emphasized the
                            need of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> to return to civilian
                            constitutional government as soon as possible and remove the Army from
                            any political power struggle. General <persName corresp="#p_MBGCB1">Magruder</persName> has also commented that apparently these
                            statements had some effect, which could not be expected, however, to

                        <p>Our representatives in Korea also felt that it was necessary for the
                            United States Government immediately to make clear that it was not
                            involved in a revolutionary group, in order to forestall speculation
                            such as the rumors prevalent in France following the abortive coup of
                            rightist forces in Algeria.</p>

                        <p>I believe that there are three kinds of actions that we should seek to
                            obtain from the Koreans in the immediate future:</p>
                        <p>1. Maximum possible civilianization of the regime and a clear distinction
                            between officers engaged in political and administrative
                            responsibilities and those engaged in military responsibilities.</p>
                        <pb n="465" xml:id="pg_465" facs="0501"/>
                        <p>2. Make it absolutely clear that U.S. assistance in the future, above a
                            minimum maintenance level, will be conditional upon Korean performance,
                            in accordance with this Administration's new aid concepts.</p>
                        <p>3. Actions to deal with corruption. This involves inter alia Civil
                            Service and police reform, reform of the tax collection system, reform
                            of government budgeting procedures, improving contracting procedures,
                            and action to rationalize interest rates.</p>

                            General <persName corresp="#p_CYCDY1">Chang Do Young</persName> and
                            Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_KH1">Kim Hong-il</persName>. We
                            are also in substantial accord with your analysis and policy suggestions

                                1640.<note n="2" xml:id="d222fn2">In telegram 1640 from Seoul, May
                                23, <persName corresp="#p_GM1">Green</persName> described the
                                approaches that he, <persName corresp="#p_MBGCB1">Magruder</persName>, and other members of the Country Team made
                                in line with the guidelines he suggested in telegram 1579 from
                                Seoul. <persName corresp="#p_GM1">Green</persName> stated that the

                                little influence and almost no authority.” <persName corresp="#p_GM1">Green</persName> proposed to concentrate his
                                efforts on the new Foreign Minister, <persName corresp="#p_KH1">Kim
                                    Hong-il</persName>, who not only was the correct channel, but
                                “one of the principal holders of power in new regime.” (Department
                                of State, Central Files, 795B.00/5-2361)</note> The sound judgment
                            and sense of balance and proportion you have shown are heartily
                            commended.</p>
                        <p>2. Department not particularly inclined to issue further circumstantial
                            policy and operating directives at this time unless you feel the need of
                            such additional detailed guidance. Such guidance would almost inevitably
                            have effect of cementing close relations with new regime and thereby
                            increasing their confidence that they can count on full US support, at a
                            time when various disturbing actions taken by them indicate that they
                            should be kept under some indirect pressure from us and in <pb n="466" xml:id="pg_466" facs="0502"/>some suspense as to our future course.
                            Possibility that General <persName corresp="#p_CM1">Chang</persName> may
                            pursue application to come to US for consultations is a further reason
                            for refraining from more detailed negotiations at this moment. We are
                            also influenced by adverse results General <persName corresp="#p_MBGCB1">Magruder</persName>'s May 23 meeting with General Pak Chung-hui,
                            amounting to <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> refusal to return
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> armed forces to operational
                            control of <gloss target="#t_CINCUNC1">CINCUNC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>3. If you nonetheless feel that you need more comprehensive guidance at
                            this stage, you should so indicate, setting forth any new operational
                            areas in which you believe Departmental instructions would be useful.
                            Bear in mind that we believe we can best test bona fides of regime by
                            observing their actions in response to representations made by you and
                            General <persName corresp="#p_MBGCB1">Magruder</persName> and that we
                            would not want to take any new initiatives at this stage which might
                            embolden them to withhold actions responsive to our known wishes. We
                            believe you have ample authority for maintaining all contacts which you
                            consider desirable.</p>

                        <p>[KRA] 306. Yesterday, through an indirect approach, I was informed that
                            former Lieutenant <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Colonel Kim Chong
                                Pil</persName> had stated that the entire joint statement as drafted
                            by General Pak Chung Hi and me could be approved by the Supreme Council
                            for National Reconstruction if they were really satisfied that I would
                            not use my operational control in an attempt to break the revolution. I
                            sent back word that I would be glad to talk to
                            <persName>Kim</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Former Lieutenant <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Colonel Kim Chong
                                Pil</persName> was perhaps the foremost of the young officers who
                            agitated for the elimination of senior officers after the April
                            revolution that overthrew President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>. He was one of the group that waited on Chief of
                            Staff General <persName corresp="#p_SY1">Song Yo Chan</persName> to <pb n="467" xml:id="pg_467" facs="0503"/>demand his resignation. He was
                            the moving spirit that activated the group of sixteen officers who
                            waited on Chief of Staff General Choi Young Hi to demand his
                            resignation. <persName>Kim</persName> did not actually enter Choi Young
                            Hi's office with the sixteen officers, he brought them to the office and
                            remained outside himself. He was perhaps the foremost of the agitators
                            whose elimination from the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Army I
                            have sought over the past year. He was eliminated from the Army in
                            February 1961. I am now informed that he is reinstated as a Lieutenant
                            Colonel although he called on me today dressed in civilian clothes.</p>
                        <p> Col Kim called on General <persName corresp="#p_MGGS1">Meloy</persName>
                            and me this morning. <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Colonel Kim</persName>
                            reviewed the justification for the revolution, regretted that the only
                            method of conducting the revolution required a violation of my
                            operational control and assured me of the good intentions of the new
                            government. He said nothing new but followed the same line that the
                            group have pursued in all their propaganda.</p>
                        <p>I accented to Col Kim that my mission was to defend Korea, not to
                            determine what kind of a government Korea had. I explained each of my
                            important actions in the past based upon carrying out my mission of
                            defending Korea. I sought by implication to make it crystal clear that
                            as long as the revolutionary government took no action that would
                            prejudice the defense of Korea they had nothing to fear from me.</p>
                        <p>I reviewed the specific actions that the coup group had taken that
                            prejudiced my ability to accomplish my mission and that I therefore
                            opposed, namely:</p>
                        <p>A. They have deprived me of some of the means for accomplishing my
                            mission by withdrawing troops assigned in the forward areas.</p>
                        <p>B. They have weakened my ability to get my orders carried out by
                            relieving and appointing senior commanders without my consent.</p>
                        <p>C. They have weakened the authority of their own commanders by the
                            organization of officers who are loyal to the coup group instead of to
                            their own commanders and who stay ready to act against their own
                            commanders when they feel those commanders are taking actions that would
                            not be approved by the coup group.</p>
                        <p>Our meeting concluded without any specific conclusions or agreements. I
                            therefore have no idea as to whether <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Colonel Kim</persName> will use his influence to seek
                            reconsideration of the disapproval by the Supreme Council for National
                            Reconstruction of the draft proposed by Major General Pak Chung Hi and
                                myself.<note n="1" xml:id="d223fn1">In telegram KRA 309 to <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName>, May 26, <persName corresp="#p_MBGCB1">Magruder</persName> stated that after

                        <p>The Problem</p>
                        <p>To assess the significance of the military coup d'etat in the Republic of
                            Korea (<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>), and to estimate probable
                            trends over the next few months.</p>
                        <p>Conclusions</p>
                        <p>1. We believe that the present coup group dominated by Major General Pak
                            Chong-hui will retain the principal elements of power in South Korea
                            over the next few months at least, whether or not nominal civilian rule
                            is re-established. (Paras. 9, 13)</p>
                        <p>2. The coup group will probably inject a new sense of drive and
                            discipline into the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Government's
                            economic and administrative efforts, and may make some headway,
                            especially in curbing corruption. However, in view of the magnitude of
                            the problems the new leaders are inheriting and are themselves creating,
                            we believe they will not make much progress, and because of their
                            inexperience and a probable reluctance to accept outside advice, may
                            make matters even worse. (Para. 16)</p>
                        <p>3. The coup group is composed of divergent elements and interests. Unless
                            Pak and his colleagues can generate and enforce a greater unity than
                            appears likely, <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> politics will
                            probably follow a pattern of constant factional maneuvering and periodic
                            shifts in power within the ruling military group. (Paras. 9-10, 14)</p>
                        <p>4. South Korea's coup leaders are a new and different breed from the
                            civilian and the more senior military people with whom the US has had
                            most contact. Their authoritarian and nationalistic stamp suggests that
                            they will be less receptive to US guidance. Furthermore, they will be
                            tough, determined, and difficult to deal with. They will probably
                            continue South Korea's alignment with the US, recognizing their
                            country's dependence on the US, but at the same time will seek to assert
                            South Korea's independence in military, economic, and political affairs.

                            will probably be a source of continuing difficulty. (Paras. 17-20)</p>
                        <p>5. The declared position of the regime is anti-Communist, and available
                            evidence does not support allegations of Pak's continuing ties with the
                            Communists. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that he is a
                            long-term Communist agent, or that he might redefect. Also, Communist
                            ends in South Korea could be advanced in the event of student and public
                            uprisings against repressive government measures and probable
                            deteriorating economic conditions. (Para. 21)</p>
                        <p>6. The coup leaders have been preoccupied with internal matters and have
                            not yet given clear definition of their intended foreign policies.
                            (Para. 22)</p>

                        <p>At the Under Secretary of State's staff meeting on June 5, <persName corresp="#p_MCWP1">McConaughy</persName> told <persName corresp="#p_BCA1">Bowles</persName> that the Task Force Report was

                                <persName corresp="#p_BCA1">Bowles</persName> had read it and
                            believed it was “an excellent report.” <persName corresp="#p_MCWP1">McConaughy</persName> reported that General Pak Chung-hui would

                        <p>A Note on the Manner in Which the Report was Prepared</p>
                        <p>Successive drafts of the report were prepared in a drafting group
                            consisting of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern
                            Economic Affairs (<persName corresp="#p_PA1">Peterson</persName>), the
                            State and <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> desk officers and me.
                            Discussion in the Task Force was confined to major issues and, except in
                            one case, never got down to specifics of language. The final draft of
                            the Introduction and Recommendations was prepared by the new ambassador
                                <pb n="470" xml:id="pg_470" facs="0506"/>(<persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName>) in the light of the last Task
                            Force discussion and was reviewed by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PA1">Peterson</persName> and me. The paper is, therefore, primarily a
                            State Department product, though State did, after argument, accept
                            language from <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DoD</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> on key paragraphs dealing with <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> military forces and electric power. The
                            acceptance of the <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> language on power
                            occurred following the review of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName>'s draft.</p>
                        <p>Rationale</p>
                        <p>When the Task Force began its work prior to the coup the U.S. was
                            endeavoring, in the words of the report, “to spur a liberal and
                            well-intentioned, but weak, administration into more resolute action on
                            basic economic and social problems”. Now we are faced by a tough,
                            authoritarian, nationalistic regime which may be capable of overriding
                            the political obstacles to action on Korean problems, but which is
                            inexperienced, likely to be plagued by continued factionalism, and
                            clearly less amenable to U.S. influence.</p>
                        <p>Yet in its fundamentals the Korean situation has not changed as a result
                            of the coup. Both the overthrow of the <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> regime and the overthrow of the <persName corresp="#p_CM1">Chang Myon</persName> regime were, at root,
                            expressions of the rising forces of nationalism in Korean society. Both
                            reflected dissatisfaction on the part of a younger generation with the
                            lack of direction and progress and with corruption in Korean
                            society.</p>
                        <p>The basic economic problems remain: resources are limited, population
                            growth rapid, and unemployment, a major problem; industry is hamstrung
                            by power and water shortages and by inadequate management and financing:
                            farmers are burdened with debt and high interest rates; corruption is
                            endemic. Our own economic assistance programs have lacked a clear
                            economic development purpose and had been inadequately administered.</p>
                        <p>Our general policy prescription both before and after the coup was to
                            harness the forces of nationalism by giving Korean society a new sense
                            of purpose. This requires a new thrust and developmental purpose in our
                            own programs (adequately dramatized by new U.S. actions) and at the same
                            time demands Korean action to begin serious economic planning and to
                            undertake a whole series of reform measures.</p>
                        <p>In the case of the old <persName corresp="#p_CM1">Chang Myon</persName>
                            regime we were more confident about its good intentions than about its
                            political capabilities. In the case of the new military regime we are
                            somewhat more confident about capabilities, at least to initiate reform
                            measures, and less confident of intentions. Thus the strategy outlined
                            in the report is one designed to elicit indications of the purposes of
                            the new group and its willingness to act and to give the ambassador
                            considerable discretion in determining when performance merits
                            responsive action on our part. Three stages in the interchange of views
                            are proposed: (a) the ambassador's initial talks <pb n="471" xml:id="pg_471" facs="0507"/>with the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Government leadership; (b) a visit by the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Chief of State to Washington; and (c)
                            the dispatch of a special envoy and mission to Korea. Initiation of each
                            successive step is contingent upon satisfactory response under the one
                            before.</p>
                        <p>Major Suggestions with Respect to the Report</p>
                        <p>1. Power. A U.S. commitment to meet Korean power needs is one of the most
                            effective means we could use to demonstrate quickly the seriousness of
                            our intent with respect to long range development and to get off to a
                            new start in our relations on economic matters. That this is one of the
                            most important bottlenecks is recognized by all; we do not need a five
                            year plan before we move ahead on it. Responsibility for past inaction
                            must be shared by the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> and U.S.
                            Governments. The <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> has failed to raise
                            rates sufficiently to pay power costs; we have taken much more time than
                            we should to decide whether we will support particular projects, notably
                            the proposed hydro project at Chongju.</p>
                        <p>The language of present par. f-(3) (p. 6)<note n="1" xml:id="d225fn1">Summarized in paragraph a-7 of <ref target="#d230">Document
                                    230</ref>.</note> goes further in the direction of a long term
                            commitment than we have been willing to go in the past according to
                                <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>. It is not nearly as strong
                            language as that contained in the penultimate draft of the report.
                                <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> objected to the stronger
                            language on the grounds that a firm and long range commitment of the
                            kind proposed had to be made strictly conditional upon more specific
                            Korean performance on reform measures. I recommend that present par.
                            f-(3) be deleted and that the following paragraph, based upon the
                            version in the last Task Force draft, be added to “Category 2”,
                            following present subpar. c (p. 7). The revisions I have made, plus the
                            placement in category 2 would recognize the <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> concern (which is to some degree legitimate) without
                            completely watering down the commitment we would make.</p>
                        <p>“d. Subject to action by the Korean Government to rationalize the
                            corporate structure and rates in the power industry, and to other clear
                            evidence of Korean action to undertake fundamental economic reform
                            measures, announce U.S. willingness to provide, subject to Congressional
                            appropriation, the external resources required to carry out an agreed
                            five- or ten-year plan of power development, including prompt
                            implementation of the Chungju hydro-electric project.”</p>
                        <p>This is the most important change that needs to be made in the report;
                            all other proposed changes below are of less importance.</p>
                        <p>2. Use of Korean forces for economic development purposes. Under the
                            Defense draft of par. e on p. 8, now incorporated in the report, U.S.

                            is that we cannot commit ourselves on the increased use of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces for civilian purposes
                            (particularly for training) until we are clear as to whether we wish to
                            maintain <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces at existing levels
                            and with existing missions. We might desire, for example, to reduce
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces and to use the savings
                            for economic development rather than to employ some of a larger <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> force in economic development
                            activities.</p>
                        <p>Since I am not optimistic that our review of force goals is likely to
                            produce a significant change (much as I would like to see one), I am
                            rather reluctant to see any action to plan for increased use of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces for economic development
                            purposes delayed for the force goal review. The U.S. military commander
                            in Korea has, I understand, been reluctant to permit use of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces in the National Construction
                            Service and on other works projects. A clear directive to the U.S.
                            commander to “encourage and support greater participation, etc. (par.
                            (3))” would be desirable even before the review of force goals is
                            completed.</p>
                        <p>We should not only make an assessment of the implications of a program
                            for using the armed forces for training in civilian skills, but should,
                            if possible, simultaneously develop a proposed program for such use so
                            that, if our assessment of the implications is favorable, we will be
                            ready to move ahead.</p>
                        <p>3. Category 3: Required Korean actions. I would favor deletion in the
                            final <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> action document of the
                            introduction to “Category 3”, (p. 10) because it weakens the whole
                            section. It is much weaker than the characterization of this category
                            contained in par. 7 of the Introduction.<note n="3" xml:id="d225fn3">
                                <persName>Johnson</persName>'s suggestion was accepted.</note>

                        <p>4. <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> leadership and organization. The
                            terms of reference for the proposed high-level mission to Korea include
                            (Appendix A, p. 2, par. 5-(e)) reference to review of the administrative
                            structure of the <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss>. This was the
                            only reference I was able to obtain to what is a most important problem.
                            There is a good deal of evidence that <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> leadership and organization leaves much to be desired.
                            State has wished to avoid reference to it. It is most important,
                            however, that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LHR1">Labouisse</persName> and
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName> be impressed
                            with the necessity for early and major action to improve the <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> situation.</p>
                        <p>Other Problems</p>
                        <p>Military involvement in civil affairs. Up to the final draft, the report
                            also contained the following language which I drafted:</p>
                        <p>“Maximum possible effort [should be made by the military regime]<note n="4" xml:id="d225fn4">Brackets in the source text.</note> to
                            insulate from direct involvement in military matters those military <pb n="473" xml:id="pg_473" facs="0509"/>officers who are engaged in
                            political and civilian administrative functions.”</p>
                        <p>This was viewed by <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> as reflecting an
                            unrealistic hope; and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName> concurred. Admittedly you cannot hope to separate
                            the top military people in the government from command responsibility,
                            but it does seem to me that those engaged in work at lower levels could
                            be so separated. If they are not, we are going to have some difficult
                            problems in Korea because of the peculiar <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Command relationship.</p>
                        <p>Korean action to improve <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>-Japanese
                            relations. Though par. f on p. 9 calls for U.S. encouragement to the
                            Japanese to improve their relations with Korea, there is no comparable
                            requirement that we put pressure on the Koreans. Such a requirement was
                            included in an earlier draft but it is State's view that we need to know
                            more about the attitude of the new regime toward Japan before we can
                            decide how far and how fast we should go in applying pressure on the
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>'s to act.<note n="5" xml:id="d225fn5">This paragraph was crossed out by

                        <p>Objectives. There was some complaint in the Task Force that we had failed
                            to state clearly our objectives with respect to Korea. It is true that
                            there is no specific objectives statement. The efforts to produce one
                            seemed to me rather sterile. It seems to me that in par. 2 of the
                            Introduction and elsewhere our general purposes come through clearly
                            enough. And our basic approach is to get the Koreans to define their own
                            objectives with some help and guidance from us.</p>
                        <p>Relations between Americans and Koreans in Korea. It is generally
                            recognized that the high standard of living and the separateness of the
                            Americans from the Korean population is an important problem. It is
                            difficult to draft a meaningful recommendation on the subject. The
                            Ambassador, I am informed, is very much aware of it and is working out
                            his own plans to deal with it.</p>
                        <p>Procedural Matters</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> action on the report. As the need
                            to include an increasing element of tactics that became evident, the
                            recommendations grew in length so that they are probably no longer brief
                            enough to be included in an <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> action.
                            Though I would like to see the Council and President approve them all, I
                            recognize that they will have to be briefed down for <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> action purposes and plan to begin work
                            immediately on the draft for the Council action.</p>

                        <p>Relative Priority of Military vs. Reconstruction Focus in Korea</p>
                        <p>Admittedly, the question of MAP aid for Korea needs further study, but it
                            is discouraging that Korean TF report<note n="1" xml:id="d226fn1">See
                                the source note, <ref target="#d225">Document 225</ref>.</note> goes
                            no further in flagging this issue.</p>
                        <p>A real <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> development program will
                            involve staggering costs over the next decade. The <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> has so many handicaps, it is so far
                            from self-sustaining growth, its governmental structure is so feeble
                            that we will be spending billions more there during the 60s. Because of
                            this, I feel a hard new look should be taken at whether we want to spend
                            even the $1.6 billion currently projected for maintaining <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces 1962-66.</p>
                        <p>In my opinion, one of the basic reasons why we have accomplished so
                            little in Korea since 1953 has been our predominantly military focus. We
                            have spent more money on MAP 1953-60 than on the domestic economy. This
                            mal-focus arose largely from the fiction that there was only a truce on
                            the “38th parallel” and that hostilities might reopen at any time. As a
                            result, we did little more than keep the economy afloat, while focussing
                            our main effort on maintaining very substantial <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces.</p>
                        <p>Obviously, there is a risk of renewed local aggression. But I would argue
                            that it is less than almost any place else around the Bloc periphery.
                            Given the consequences of its last miscalculation, would the Bloc
                            leadership really regard it as sensible to reopen the Korean war? Look
                            at the deterrents! There still exist a series of condemnatory
                            resolutions and a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Command (even though
                            in attenuated form). On top of the direct UN role in Korea, we have far
                            more than a plate glass window, in the form of two divisions of US
                            troops with nuclear capabilities. Add to this ten regular and nine
                            reserve ROK divisions and you have a greater deterrent capability than
                            any place but perhaps the Taiwan Strait. Moreover, the Chinese forces
                            have long since withdrawn from North Korea, although the <gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss> divisions in Manchuria are still close
                            at hand.</p>
                        <p>Given all these deterrents, the risk of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> being attacked again is far less than that of its being
                            subverted because of internal weakness. The North Koreans are already
                            beginning to play the siren song of reunification, and it may have
                            increasing appeal in a weak and disunited south. If South Korea goes, it
                            will go this route and not that of local war.</p>
                        <pb n="475" xml:id="pg_475" facs="0511"/>
                        <p>Of course with a hard-nosed military regime now in the saddle, it may be
                            difficult to talk about reducing MAP. I would argue, however, that this
                            might be a good means of forcing the young colonels to face up to the
                            hard realities of domestic reconstruction instead of letting them talk
                            us into continuing to foot huge military as well as civilian bills.</p>
                        <p>Hence I urge flagging this issue for the President. Korea's domestic
                            needs are so great that we may have to take risks in other categories to
                            find the resources necessary to do the job. A gradual cut in <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces to around 14 and ultimately 12
                            divisions would still give us quite a deterrent, and free substantial
                            resources to meet the real problems facing us in the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>.</p>

                        <p>THE TASK FORCE REPORT ON KOREA</p>
                        <p>I. Key Issues</p>
                        <p>To what extent should U.S. aid be contingent upon Korean performance? To
                            give the Korean people a sense of progress and a realization that the
                            U.S. is shifting its emphasis to economic development and reform may
                            require certain quite dramatic U.S. actions. But unhappy experience with
                            past Korean inaction and the toughness of the new regime suggest the
                            importance of making U.S. offers of assistance contingent upon specific
                            Korean performance on needed reform measures. Under such circumstances,
                            the dramatic impact of the U.S. action may be dissipated.</p>
                        <p>In general the revised recommendations call for a fairly tough U.S.
                            policy of making our commitments to provide economic development
                            assistance contingent upon Korean performance with considerable
                            discretion left to the Ambassador to determine when performance is
                            adequate (pars. 4, 6, 7, 12).<note n="1" xml:id="d227fn1">All references
                                to paragraphs and subparagraphs of the revised recommendations are
                                to those in <ref target="#d230">Document 230</ref>.</note> Once the
                            Koreans have taken action on a <pb n="476" xml:id="pg_476" facs="0512"/>series of reform measures we would be quite forthcoming in offering
                            U.S. support for economic development, including specifically power
                            development.</p>
                        <p>How much of a commitment should the U.S. make toward meeting Korea's
                            electric power needs? This question is a particular variant of the
                            question above. Power is a serious bottleneck in Korea preventing full
                            utilization of existing industrial plant capacity. The U.S. estimates
                            five year power needs at 480,000 kw of installed capacity. Action is
                            underway to provide 80,000 kw of this amount, in part through emergency
                            measures such as provision of power barges.</p>
                        <p>Debate in the Task Force centered upon the question of how far the U.S.
                            should go in committing itself to meeting the remaining power
                            requirement of 400,000 kw until there was concrete action by the Korean
                            government to increase rates, to consolidate the power companies and to
                            eliminate power losses. The revised recommendations propose (par. 4(b))
                            that we indicate a willingness to undertake specific projects provided
                            action on reform measures is begun, and (par. 7) that we commit
                            ourselves to an agreed five year program when concrete action has been
                            completed.</p>
                        <p>Should missions and force levels for <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            armed forces be revised? The revised recommendations call for a review
                            of missions and of alternative force and equipment structures (par. 8).
                            The arguments of proponents and opponents of reduction are described in
                            an attachment to this paper. <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> force
                            levels seem better suited to meeting the Communist threat as we
                            perceived it in the 1950's than to dealing with present dangers and
                            politico-economic needs.</p>
                        <p>All <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>-proposed changes in the
                            recommendations of the report have been accepted in the revised
                            recommendations except for two proposed changes in par. 8. One of these
                                (<gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> memo, par. 2) would make it
                            clear that the Secretary of Defense would make the assessment of Korean
                            force and equipment levels and that the Secretary of State would be
                            limited to coordinating political and economic factors with this
                            assessment. The suggestion implies too clean a distinction between the
                            two processes. The other change (Appendix to <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> memo, par. f) would delete the word “substantial” from
                            par. 8 (b) of the revised recommendations on the grounds that it
                            prejudges the outcome of the force level review.<note n="2" xml:id="d227fn2">The views of the Joint Chiefs of Staff are in a

                                Countries Series, Korea, General, 6/61)</note> But the wording of 8
                            (b) makes clear that a “substantial reduction in forces” is only one
                            alternative that would be studied.</p>
                        <p>To what extent should we encourage and support the use of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> armed forces for economic development
                            purposes? The question has two aspects: (a) <pb n="477" xml:id="pg_477" facs="0513"/>use of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces to
                            provide the leadership in the National Construction Service (a kind of
                            CCC) and in similar public works activities; and (b) use of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces for expanded training in
                            civilian skills. The armed forces now participate in the National
                            Construction Service. However, it is alleged that the U.S. military in
                            Korea has been less than completely enthusiastic about such use. The
                            first sentence of par. 9 of the revised recommendations would direct the
                            U.S. military to encourage greater participation. The U.S. military is
                            very reluctant to give up time from military duties for training in
                            civilian skills. The second sentence of par. 9 of the recommendations
                            calls for preparation of a proposed program of increased training and
                            the assessment of its economic and military implications.</p>
                        <p>II. Other Matters</p>
                        <p>1. Until the final draft, the revised recommendations made the invitation
                            to the Korean Chief of Government to visit Washington contingent upon
                            some Korean action on reform measures. At the request of Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> the contingent feature of
                            the invitation was eliminated (par. 3 of recommendations) on the grounds
                            that we were committed to an invitation and that it should not be
                            delayed unduly.</p>
                        <p>2. The new Korean regime seems, on present evidence, much more
                            anti-Japanese than its immediate predecessor. Therefore, though we
                            believe that <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>-Japanese rapprochement
                            is of great economic importance to Korea, State is not optimistic that
                            Japanese investment in, or economic aid to, Korea is an immediate
                            prospect. When the Japanese seemed, just after the recent coup, to want
                            to rush in with substantial economic aid, State suggested that they go
                            slow fearing a Korean rebuff which would seriously set back
                            relations.</p>
                        <p>3. Present at the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> meeting today will
                            be the new first team in Korea: Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Samuel
                                Berger</persName>, the new U.S. Ambassador; General <persName corresp="#p_MGGS1">Guy Meloy</persName>, presently Deputy United
                            Nations Commander who will take over as the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Commander on July 1; and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KJS1">James Killen</persName>, presently <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> Director in Pakistan who is to be designated the new
                                <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> Director in Korea. You may
                            wish to have a brief talk with these three immediately following the
                            Council meeting.</p>
                        <p>Attachment</p>
                        <p>THE PROS AND CONS OF A REDUCTION IN ROK FORCES</p>
                        <p>I. Existing Forces in Korea</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> army of 525,000 men consists of
                            18 divisions plus artillery, anti-aircraft, heavy mortar and tank
                            battalions. In addition the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s <pb n="478" xml:id="pg_478" facs="0514"/>have one marine division and
                            ten reserve army divisions. Two U.S. Army divisions are in Korea. The
                            North Koreans maintain a total of 355,000 men under arms (compares with
                            600,000 for <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>), including a 22
                            division army. The ChiComs have no forces in North Korea but could
                            deploy 6-8 divisions to the Demilitarized Zone within 10 to 14 days.
                            Neither North nor South Korea has much of a navy; the North Korean air
                            force is somewhat superior to the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            air force.</p>
                        <p>II. The Arguments For a Reduction in <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            Forces</p>
                        <p>The direct threat of military aggression across the 38th Parallel is
                            slight. We have a political and military plate-glass window in place
                            there. The border is clearly demarked; the U.S. divisions are in place;
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Command provides the structure for
                            an international response to aggression. The Communists have greater
                            opportunities for gains with less risk in other areas of Asia.</p>
                        <p>U.S. aid to Korea, partly because of a mistaken focus on a military
                            threat, has been concentrated upon the support of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> military forces and upon repairing war
                            damage, with very little left for economic development. Meanwhile, the
                            new tide of Korean nationalism and the submerged, but clearly present,
                            desire for unification pose, in the face of the economic stagnation and
                            poverty of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> and North Korea's
                            considerable economic progress, important long-run political dangers. To
                            harness the forces of Korean nationalism to the constructive ends of
                            economic development will require either still more massive U.S. aid
                            (which the Korean economy would have difficulty absorbing) or a
                            substantial shift of U.S. and Korean resources from military support to
                            economic development.</p>
                        <p>The <persName corresp="#p_CM1">Chang Myon</persName> government exerted
                            pressure on the United States to agree to Korean force reductions, but
                            we made only minimal concessions. Though it may be difficult to force it
                            to do so, the new military regime must be made to face Korea's real
                            economic problems and to recognize that existing <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> force levels make poor military and economic sense.</p>
                        <p>III. The Arguments Against a Reduction in <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Forces</p>
                        <p>The military situation is stable in Korea because the level of U.S. and
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces is adequate to deter
                            attack. [<hi rend="italic">6-1/2 lines of source text not
                                declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> is an abundant source of low-cost
                            military manpower which, if we continue to utilize it fully, will
                            continue to give greater strategic flexibility to U.S. forces in coping
                            with pressures elsewhere on the ChiCom periphery. Moreover, a
                            considerable reduction in the level of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces would be required to produce any real saving of
                            resources. This is partly because, unless we permit <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> capabilities to decline, any
                            substantial reduction in forces would have to be accompanied by <pb n="479" xml:id="pg_479" facs="0515"/>increased modernization. The
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s would probably also demand such
                            modernization as a price for agreement to force reductions. In addition,
                            because of the unemployment problem in South Korea, release of men from
                            the armed forces would only transfer the burden of maintaining them to
                            the civilian economy. Finally, it seems most unlikely that a force
                            reduction would be politically acceptable to the new Korean military
                            regime.</p>

                            President presiding, 32 people attended the meeting including Secretary

                            meeting was taken up with a report by the President on his European
                            trip, including the summit meeting at Vienna with Soviet Chairman
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Nikita Khrushchev</persName>. The other
                            topic of discussion was Korea.</p>
                        <p>According to cryptic notes by <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>
                            began by reviewing past events in South Korea. He stressed that the
                            current government had “no experience” and “no honest administrators.”
                            The question of the invitation of the leader of the Supreme Council for
                            National Reconstruction to visit the United States was discussed.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName> would assess
                            the prospects. <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName>'s notes
                            outlined his presentation of the military problem: South Korea was in a
                            suspended state of war; in light of U.S. lives and money expended during
                            the Korean war, the United States had a great stake in Korea: and, there
                            was “great pressure” for subversion and infiltration, “like Vietnam and
                            Laos.” <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> noted that
                            South Korea had a 155-mile front line. He highlighted substantial
                            problems with the flow of refugees from north to south (presumably
                            during the Korean war) and the problem of unemployment. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> raised the issue of South Korean
                            economic viability and <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName>
                            stated that Korea was “not as hopeless” as it might seem. The revised
                            recommendations of the Task Force were approved as amended and deemed
                            “adequate.” (<persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName>'s

                        <p>In taking up the report of the Task Force on Korea,<note n="1" xml:id="d229fn1">See the source note, <ref target="#d225">Document
                                    225</ref>.</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> summarized the history of
                            political development of that country and outlined U.S. aims and
                            intentions. He also cited certain economic figures. In response to a
                            question by the President about the relative status of North and South
                            Korea, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCWP1">McConaughy</persName> replied
                            that approximately 35% of the working force is unemployed or only
                            partially employed in South Korea, in contrast to no unemployment in
                            North Korea. He added quickly that this figure for North Korea was
                            deceiving because of the Communist methods of utilizing labor,
                            frequently under slave conditions. Although agriculture is better in
                            South Korea, manufacturing is more highly developed in the north where
                            the gross national product is rising, but only to be plowed back into
                            the industrial base and war potential. He went on to say that the
                            greatest hindrance to Korean development was the continued animosity
                            between Japan and South Korea and the failure to re-establish relations
                            which would prove mutually beneficial. He said that one of the principal
                            missions of Ambassadors <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName>
                            and <persName corresp="#p_REO1">Reischauer</persName> should be to
                            attempt to establish a reconciliation between the two countries.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> wanted to go on record
                            as opposing any decrease in the level of the armed forces of Korea at
                            this time. He felt that any proposed decrease would first of all
                            alienate the new military leadership; secondly, it would contribute
                            further to the serious unemployment problem; and thirdly, it was well
                            worth keeping effective troops on the front line at a cost of only $5
                            per month, especially when a decrease of approximately 100,000 soldiers
                            would save only $6 million per year.</p>
                        <p>The President asked if it would be possible to increase to any measurable
                            extent the contribution of the armed forces to civilian work. The Deputy
                            Commander-in-Chief, <gloss target="#t_UNC1">UNC</gloss>, replied that
                            road and mining projects are presently being performed by certain units
                            of the armed forces, but expressed the opinion that little more could be
                            done without an unacceptable decrease in military effectiveness.
                                <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> interrupted with
                            the observation that from a military standpoint force levels are
                            presently below that which is necessary for an adequate defense of
                            Korea. He said that he is simply repeating the views which he and
                            Generals <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> and <pb n="481" xml:id="pg_481" facs="0517"/>Decker have expressed previously. He
                            cited the 157-mile front which must still be defended against the same
                            threat and even against a more highly efficient North Korean force than
                            existed during wartime—all this even without regard to the fact that a
                            state of war technically still exists.</p>
                        <p>The President expressed the view that the economic and political
                            situation in and about Korea were such as to present a hopeless
                            situation. <persName corresp="#p_MCWP1">McConaughy</persName> confirmed
                            that it was bad and perhaps would not improve principally because of an
                            unstable economy, limited resources and an explosive population.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> disagreed with the
                            acceptance of a hopeless economic situation and cited the following
                            three factors as the basis for a certain degree of optimism:</p>
                        <p>1. New effective economic and social planning.</p>
                        <p>2. Young, aggressive, capable people in government.</p>
                        <p>3. Better relations with Japan.</p>
                        <p>The President concluded that the best opportunity for improvement among
                            those mentioned would appear to be the improvement of Korean-Japan
                            relations and directed Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName> to concentrate on the issue. The President
                            suggested that the U.S. should also have a look at its own program and
                            position and asked what we should demand of the Koreans. <persName corresp="#p_MCWP1">McConaughy</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName> agreed that a start should be
                            made by demanding a decrease in corruption. The President stated that he
                            would take up the subject of improvement in relations with Korea with
                            the Japanese Prime Minister next week.</p>
                        <p>General Decker stated that in his view the most ominous and difficult
                            problem in Korea is the control of the country by a bunch of junior
                            officers and suggested that the United States demand the return of
                            control of the armed forces and the country immediately to senior
                            officers “rather than to a bunch of lieutenant colonels.” He went on to
                            say that he had already conveyed this idea to the Korean officer who has
                            just departed the U.S. to become the new Defense Minister. The President
                            disagreed with General Decker and expressed the opinion that the United
                            States had no alternative except to deal with the people in power.</p>

                        <p>a. Discussed the Report of the Task Force on Korea and concurred in the
                            following recommendations:</p>
                        <p>U.S. Actions to be Undertaken Immediately</p>
                        <p>1. The new U.S. Ambassador to Korea should undertake early discussions
                            with the appropriate leaders of the Supreme Council for National
                            Reconstruction along the lines described in paragraphs a<note n="4" xml:id="d230fn4">Paragraph a on page 5 of the report reads: “To

                                read: “c. To affirm the intention of the U.S. to continue supporting
                                assistance to the civilian economy and defense establishment; d. To
                                make clear that the higher levels of assistance to support a
                                National Development Plan will be provided only as the Korean
                                Government enters into and carries out firm and specific commitments

                                prepared to offer technical and managerial experts to the Supreme

                            and subsequently the Ambassador should seek to create a gradual

                            interest and in the interest of their country that they from time to
                            time publicly reaffirm their intention eventually to restore
                            representative government and constitutional liberties; and that failure
                            over the long run to demonstrate their good faith in this matter will
                            compromise them in the eyes of the people of the United States and other

                            Washington for an informal visit including conferences with the
                            President and the Secretary of State.</p>
                        <p>4. Provided assurances are given in respect to the matters to be
                            discussed under 1 and 2 above and that the Korean Government undertakes
                            actions immediately with respect to certain essential reforms, including
                            the completion of fiscal, foreign exchange and stabilization reforms,
                            the rationalization of the corporate structure and rates in the power
                            and transportation industries, and the bringing into production of
                            certain factories already built; and provided the Ambassador is
                            satisfied with evidences of Korean willingness and capacity to carry out
                            mutually agreed plans and programs, then the Ambassador is
                            authorized:</p>
                        <p>(a) to indicate U.S. willingness to release approximately $28 million in
                            remaining defense support funds for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                            1961;</p>
                        <p>(b) to state that the United States is willing to enter into agreed

                            immediately upon appropriation of funds;</p>
                        <p>(c) to indicate U.S. willingness to support through U.S. aid the
                            expansion and intensification of the National Construction Service on a
                            long-term basis;</p>
                        <p>(d) to offer technical experts to assist the Korean Government in
                            preparation of its Five-Year Development Plan; and</p>
                        <p>(e) to state that, provided substantial progress is made in the next few
                            months, the United States will be prepared to provide resources to the
                            Korean Government to help carry out a Five-Year Development Plan. As a
                            long-term policy, U.S. influence should be reinforced by making economic
                            development assistance (as distinguished from supporting assistance)
                            available in increments which can be withheld in the event of Korean
                            failure to carry out agreed programs.</p>
                        <p>5. The Director of the International Cooperation Administration should
                            take immediate measures to improve the administration of the United
                            States Operations Mission in Korea, including action to concentrate the
                            U.S. effort on the most essential projects and to reduce or eliminate
                            others.</p>

                        <p>6. Upon a determination of the Secretary of State that the Korean
                            Government is sufficiently stable and cooperative to justify provision
                            of long-range development assistance to it, the actions specified in
                            paragraphs <pb n="484" xml:id="pg_484" facs="0520"/>a through d<note n="7" xml:id="d230fn7">Paragraphs a-d on pages 7-8 of the report

                                group of economic advisers and would carry out the terms of
                                reference set forth in Appendix A. c. Announce, on the
                                recommendation of the Special Envoy and the Ambassador, the
                                readiness of the U.S. to make available, in concert with other
                                nations of the Free World, external resources to support a Korean
                                Five-Year National Development Plan; d. Authorize the Secretary of
                                State to explore with nations most likely to make a contribution to
                                Korean developments (e.g. Japan and Germany), their willingness to
                                contribute to such a program.”</note> (pp. 7-8) should be taken,
                            including the appointment of a Special Envoy of the highest stature to
                            visit Korea at a time recommended by the Ambassador. The Envoy will be
                            accompanied by a group of economic advisers to perform functions along
                            the lines of those described in Appendix A to the report, including
                            assistance in the definition of Korean economic goals. While the Koreans
                            must establish and take responsibility for their own goals, the United
                            States can, having defined its goals, help advise the Koreans toward
                            goals that are realistic and consistent with our own. The economic goals
                            which the United States should seek to achieve in Korea include: (1)
                            reversal of the present downward trend in the rate of economic growth
                            and establishment of a specific target of an average annual growth rate
                            for the first five-year plan (rate in 1960: 2.3 per cent); (2) reduction
                            of the present unemployment and underemployment rate (estimated at 35
                            per cent); (3) increase in average real farm income; and (4) consistent
                            with (1)-(3) above, reduction of the present wide gap between imports
                            and exports ($30 million v. $345 million) in a staged progression toward
                            an eventual balance in Korea's international accounts.</p>
                        <p>7. Subject to concrete action by the Korean Government to increase
                            electric power rates, consolidate the power companies and eliminate
                            power losses, announce U.S. willingness to provide, subject to
                            Congressional appropriation, the external resources required to carry
                            out an agreed five-year plan of electric power development. In addition
                            announce that Korean power requirements for the next ten years will be
                            further reviewed and the level of U.S. support re-examined following
                            development of an adequate Korean Five-Year Development Plan.</p>
                        <p>8. The Secretaries of State and Defense should conduct an urgent review
                            of the force and equipment levels of Korean Armed Forces, including in
                            the first instance a military assessment of (a) the missions of these
                            forces, in the context of overall U.S. Far East strategy and in the
                            light of the Communist threat and of the anticipated deployment and use
                            of U. S. forces; and (b) the strategic implications of alternative force
                            and equipment structures, including the adequacy of the existing level
                            of forces. Such a military assessment should then be keyed to political
                            and <pb n="485" xml:id="pg_485" facs="0521"/>economic factors, to
                            produce a recommendation for long-term force goals and for immediate
                            actions, as necessary and practical, to move toward these goals. This
                            review should be completed in time for use as a basis for allocation of
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1962 military assistance
                            funds.</p>
                        <p>9. U.S. military personnel should be directed to encourage and support
                            greater participation by Korean armed forces in the work of the National
                            Construction Service and in other appropriate civil works projects. The
                            review referred to in 8 above should also include the preparation, and
                            the assessment of the economic and military implications, of a program
                            to place far greater stress than heretofore on the training of Korean
                            military personnel in skills and vocations which will permit them to
                            make a greater contribution to the development of Korean infrastructure
                            and the civilian economy.</p>

                                changes of government. It should be understood that while the U.S.
                                will not participate actively in negotiations, it should be prepared
                                to act as a catalyst in seeking a settlement. The Prime Minister
                                should be encouraged to continue efforts recently begun to develop
                                Japanese trade with Korea, and to provide economic assistance for
                                Korean development coordinated with American programs. It should be
                                made clear that Japanese settlement of <gloss target="#t_GARIOA1">GARIOA</gloss> is not to be related to U.S. and Japanese aid to

                            have, of course, to be tested against future developments.</p>
                        <p>A. Conclusions:</p>
                        <p>(1) Junta has no intention of relinquishing power to civilian authority
                            for long time—perhaps years. Moreover, deeply distrustful of civilians
                                <pb n="487" xml:id="pg_487" facs="0523"/>and bent on achieving its
                            aims by rigidly enforced national discipline, junta members are
                            unwilling at present, despite yesterday's regimented “citizens rally”
                            (Embtel 1786),<note n="3" xml:id="d231fn3">Dated June 12. (Ibid.,
                                795B.00/6-1261)</note> to undertake any real broadening of
                            government's base by bringing civilian leaders into authoritative
                            positions. In refusing make such concessions they not only disregard our
                            urging but put themselves in position of opposition to main stream
                            Korean public thought which, as near as we can judge, desires fairly
                            early return civil authority or, at minimum, establishment of target
                            date for such return.</p>
                        <p>(2) It is still unclear where new regime is moving. Junta indicates its
                            intention eradicating communism, corruption and social evils, but it may
                            well pursue these worthy objectives by self-defeating means. Excessively
                            narrow, repressive, end-justifies-means tactics will weaken Korea's
                            capability to cope with the fundamental problems of instability, mutual
                            distrust, poverty, backwardness, surplus population and
                            under-employment. Junta seems poorly organized at present in terms of
                            structure as well as competency of military to deal with nation's
                            staggering economic problems despite plain evidence that economic
                            disorder is principal cause of political instability here.</p>
                        <p>(3) Divisions among junta members and within <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> military may become accentuated in months ahead. In
                            absence single strong leader commanding national respect, factionalism
                            and old loyalties, as well as basic differences in outlook between
                            senior and junior officers, will be all the greater obstacles to
                            cohesive operations by junta. Continuation of junta as now constituted
                            is not assured and, particularly, General <persName corresp="#p_CYCDY1">Chang Do-young</persName>'s future is insecure. So far junta has
                            been engaged in denouncing and tearing down the old order, but it now
                            faces the far more difficult job of constructing a viable
                            social-political order, advancing the national economy and ensuring
                            stability. Difficulties of this task will impose new and greater strains
                            on the group holding power.</p>
                        <p>(4) Junta outwardly appears confident that US gives and will give it full
                            support, and indeed increased economic aid, as long as junta
                            demonstrates it is clearly anti-Communist. Up to present, junta's
                            principal argument for full or increased US support, usually made in
                            private conversations, is that this will help put government in strong
                            position from which it (especially younger military officers will feel
                            they) can afford be less repressive and more attentive to broadening
                            base of government. In absence full support and assistance in future,
                            however, junta will seek to intimidate us into giving such support on
                            grounds that only alternative to continuation of junta is a Communist
                            takeover.</p>

                        <p>B. Policy Implications:</p>
                        <p>I believe that we should continue along general policy lines which we
                            have pursued over past several weeks. Although many of our counsels seem
                            to have been ignored, I nevertheless feel that our efforts have not been
                            all in vain. We have undoubtedly averted perpetrations of greater
                            excesses by regime. Moreover, US press and Congressional reactions have
                            not gone unnoticed, and <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> leaders
                            are acutely aware of necessity for continued military and economic aid
                            from us. Despite surface appearances, junta is probably far from feeling
                            secure. In final analysis this uncertainty is probably our most useful
                            short-range means of preventing regime from riding roughshod over Korean
                            people and of moving it in direction of positive program for coping with
                            national problems which could enlist true public support at home and
                            abroad. Under these conditions, a position of friendly reserve is
                            infinitely preferable to expressions of complete confidence and support
                            which reduce our ability to influence situation and, in event regime
                            becomes dangerously repressive and discredited with people, would
                            resound only to advantage of the ever-ready Communists and to permanent
                            detriment of US standing with the Korean people.</p>
                        <p> US friendship and prestige in Korea should not stand or fall with this
                            present regime. Our time-tested friends in Korea are still the Korean
                            people, not necessarily those few who arrogate power to speak for them,
                            who may be corrupted by the power they too long wield, and who may fail
                            to hold this nation's confidence and support.</p>

                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> said that a
                            question of utmost difficulty for Japan is the problem of Korea. From
                            its own experience of governing Korea for 40 years, Japan recognizes
                            that the Koreans are difficult to deal with, being exclusive and
                            self-willed. The problem is what to do at the present time. The Prime
                            Minister claimed that Japanese relations had not been formalized with
                            the Republic of Korea and as a result of the recent coup there is very
                            little that Japan can do. The Japanese people do not like the recent
                            developments and would like to see an early restoration of civil
                            government. However, since the coup is an accomplished fact, the
                            situation must be dealt with as it now stands. The Prime Minister
                            pointed out that the Japanese are powerless to influence Korean
                            political developments and therefore hope that the U.S. will restore
                            civil government. To do so, however, Japan feels that it is necessary
                            first to restore economic stability and is prepared to cooperate with
                            external assistance to Korea to accomplish this objective.</p>
                        <p>The President said that the United States had been hopeful regarding the
                            ability of the former regime to gain increasing popular support. <pb n="490" xml:id="pg_490" facs="0526"/>We now face a very difficult
                            situation which concerns us greatly, particularly in the light of the
                            large scale unemployment and discontent in Korea. He said that we intend
                            to use our influence to move the new regime to a restoration of
                            constitutional methods and civil rule, but this will be a slow process.
                            The President pointed out that the United States has spent a
                            considerable amount of money in Korea with little to show for it in view
                            of the serious economic difficulties and discontent. However, we intend
                            to continue aid to this country. He said it would be most helpful to
                            bring about agreement between Japan and Korea, although we recognize
                            this is difficult due to the nationalistic flavor of the coup group and
                            the popular dislike in Japan for militaristic regimes. One aim of our
                            policy in Korea is to attempt to establish close relations between Japan
                            and Korea. We also consider that Japanese assistance, particularly for
                            power development, would be very helpful.</p>
                        <p>The President asked whether, in the Prime Minister's judgment, a
                            communist seizure of control of South Korea would have an extremely
                            adverse effect on Japan. The Prime Minister replied that the record of
                            Japan's long history testifies to the fact that the security of Korea
                            is, in effect, a domestic problem for Japan. Japan has a very vital
                            stake in Korea. Japan is willing to accept even the present regime since
                            it is anti-communist. Although it is important to bring about an
                            improvement in the present situation, it is even more essential to
                            prevent a communist takeover of South Korea.</p>
                        <p>The President suggested that there be further talks with the Secretary on
                            the Korean question, and the Prime Minister agreed.</p>

                                <pb n="491" xml:id="pg_491" facs="0527"/>related army message<note n="2" xml:id="d233fn2">Not further identified.</note> which raised
                            the question of whether there was significant Communist influence in the
                            new military regime in Korea. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCWP1">McConaughy</persName> indicated that the Secretary was very
                            disturbed by the embassy message.</p>
                        <p>The message reported a conversation between Charge <persName corresp="#p_GM1">Green</persName> and Lieutenant General Choi Kyong
                            Nok in which the latter stated that Communists were behind the coup.
                            General Choi based his belief on his personal knowledge of officers
                            within the coup group, on information he had received from friends
                            within the group, and on his examination of the past records of
                            individuals within the coup group which indicated connections with the
                            North Korean regime during the period 1945-49. He stated that he did not
                            know whether General Pak was a Communist. He did identify four other
                            generals by name as Communists and claimed that an additional three or
                            four unnamed colonels were Communists.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCWP1">McConaughy</persName> said that he had
                            high regard for General Choi, but noted that General Choi had never got
                            along well with General Pak who was at one time his deputy. Moreover,
                            General Choi was related to the Foreign Minister of <persName corresp="#p_CM1">Chang Myon</persName>'s government. It was,
                            therefore, necessary to take his allegations with a grain of salt.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FGD1">FitzGerald</persName> of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> indicated that <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> had examined biographical information on the members of
                            the group, [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>] and had consulted with one of its best sources
                                [<hi rend="italic">3 lines of source text not declassified</hi>]. He
                            said that all of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>'s evidence
                            indicated that the officers in <gloss target="#t_SCNR1">SCNR</gloss> are
                            highly motivated individuals who were disgusted with the <persName corresp="#p_CM1">Chang Myon</persName> government and who had
                            engaged from time to time in plotting. <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> does not think that they are Communists although there
                            may be some Communist agents in the substructure of the coup group. A
                            greater danger, in <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>'s opinion, is the
                            possibility that the coup group may, through naivete, be led to believe
                            that unification with the North is both feasible and desirable. In
                            conclusion, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FGD1">FitzGerald</persName> stated
                            that the main stream of the coup group is not Communist.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> noted that these
                            cables had been discussed at the <gloss target="#t_USIB1">USIB</gloss>
                            meeting the previous day and that <gloss target="#t_USIB1">USIB</gloss>
                            had also concluded that the coup group was not Communist.<note n="3" xml:id="d233fn3">No record of the <gloss target="#t_USIB1">USIB</gloss> meeting has been found.</note> It was possible
                            that the idea of adopting a Nasser-type approach might cross the minds
                            of members of the coup group though we consider it unlikely that the
                            regime will move in that direction. There is also some danger of
                            penetration of the coup group by the Communists for intelligence
                            purposes.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_HRALC1">Heinz</persName>, while not
                            commenting on the allegations of Communism, expressed concern over the
                            growing power of Lieutenant <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Colonel Kim
                                Chong-pil</persName> (head of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            intelligence and one of those accused <pb n="492" xml:id="pg_492" facs="0528"/>by Choi) who, he feared, might be setting the stage for
                            ruthless one-man rule. If this kind of rule were established, it might
                            make it easier for the Communists to take over in the future.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCWP1">McConaughy</persName> agreed that the
                            repressive acts of the new regime could produce a future explosion. He
                            thought that General Choi may have been influenced in his view by the
                            fact that the methods being used by the new regime were, in certain
                            respects, similar to those used by the Communists. He mentioned
                            specifically the parading of hoodlums through the streets. It was
                            subsequently pointed out that this had been a common practice in China
                            long before the Communists took over there.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SW1">Sheppard</persName> said that the only
                            evidence that <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> had that was
                            conceivably relevant was the fact that, in conferences with economic
                            officials of the new regime, there was an increasing emphasis on the
                            “socialist character” of the new regime. When pressed for details, these
                            officials become quite vague. Mr. FitzGerald suggested that it was
                            important for all agencies that had contacts with the military to look
                            for evidences of attitudes that might have a bearing on the question of
                            Communist influence.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Roger Hilsman</persName> pointed out that a
                            number of those who were accused by General Choi had tangled with him at
                            one time or another.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCWP1">McConaughy</persName> asked what Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SW1">Sheppard</persName> made of the fact that
                            we had had almost no contact with the people on the economic side of the
                            new regime. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SW1">Sheppard</persName>
                            attributed this to three causes: (a) organizational confusion; (b) the
                            fact that the ministries were headed by military officers and that
                            officials below the top level had inhibitions about talking; and (c) of
                            the fact that there were various apparently influential economic
                            committees under the <gloss target="#t_SCNR1">SCNR</gloss> with which we
                            had so far been unable to establish effective contact.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion it was agreed that the coup in Korea had not been the
                            “cleverest Communist coup” ever pulled off. It was also agreed that
                            there was some possible danger, as a result of a power struggle within
                            the <gloss target="#t_SCNR1">SCNR</gloss>, that a group that was losing
                            out might attempt a unification maneuver in cooperation with the North
                            as a means of salvaging its position. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FGD1">FitzGerald</persName> suggested that the country team be asked to
                            prepare a contingency plan against such possibility. I suggested that
                            contingency planning be broadened to cover various other sorts of
                            situations that might develop out of a power struggle within the <gloss target="#t_SCNR1">SCNR</gloss>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCWP1">McConaughy</persName> agreed that, as a first step in developing
                            such a contingency plan, it would be desirable to ask for the views of
                            the country team.</p>
                        <p>At the end of the meeting Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCWP1">McConaughy</persName> raised the question of progress reports to
                            the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>. As a result of the discussion
                            that I had with the State people at the meeting and subsequently with
                                <persName corresp="#p_SB1">Brom Smith</persName>, it was agreed that
                            progress reports would be prepared, in accordance with <pb n="493" xml:id="pg_493" facs="0529"/>existing State procedure, for the
                            Operations Center and that a copy of these reports would be sent to Mr.

                                    just learned that Special Ambassador Soo would be returning to
                                    Seoul because “the situation required his presence,” and

                        <p>In the course of an official <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> good
                            will mission to Washington July 5-9, 1961, the chief of the mission,
                            Special Ambassador Yang Soo Yoo, accompanied by the Korean Ambassador,
                            Il <persName corresp="#p_IKC1">Kwon Chung</persName>, and the Korean
                            Embassy Political Counselor, Mr. Yun Yong Lim, called on the Secretary.
                            Although Ambassador Yoo's English is fairly good and he <pb n="494" xml:id="pg_494" facs="0530"/>required no interpreting from English
                            into Korean, Counselor Lim interpreted for him from Korean into
                            English.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Yoo said that his Government and people have been extremely
                            gratified by the assurances given by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName> that the United States
                            Government would continue its keen interest in Korea and cooperate with
                            the new <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Government for the welfare
                            of Korea. Ambassador Yoo trusted that the Secretary understood the
                            extremely difficult situation the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            faced from the political, economic, and national security points of view
                            prior to the military takeover, which the junta considered essential as
                            possibly the last opportunity for the salvation of the country.
                            Expressing deep gratitude for the “'sympathetic understanding” shown by
                            the U.S. Government, Ambassador Yoo affirmed that the new <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> regime intends to make every effort to
                            sustain the “sympathy and expectations” of the U.S. Yoo stressed that
                            among the announced objectives of the new Government the most important
                            are (1) strengthening national security against subversion and
                            aggression, (2) eradicating all forms of corruption and inefficiency,
                            and (3) turning over the Government to civilian control as soon as the
                            regime's pledges are achieved. Yoo emphasized that his Government has
                            every intention to return to civilian control as soon as the “opportune
                            time arrives when we can turn over the government to conscientious,
                            clean civilians”. The new <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> leaders
                            realize the importance of continued close relations with the U.S. and
                            the need to promote even closer ties.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Yoo said he recognized that recent events in Seoul have placed
                            the executive branch of the U.S. Government, particularly the State
                            Department, in a difficult position, and remarked that Senator Morse had
                            told him that the Secretary had been hard pressed by Congress on foreign
                            aid including the Korean aid program. Yoo stated that in this initial
                            stage the new government has many obstacles to overcome and some actions
                            have not met with U.S. approval, but the Korean leaders are aware of
                            “what is required of them” and realize that in trying to achieve their
                            objectives it is of prime importance not to “place a curtain across
                            Korean-American friendship”.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary pointed out that since 1945 the U.S. and Korean peoples had
                            shared a great deal, fighting a war and struggling to rebuild the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> together. The American people have
                            accepted large sacrifices in the interest of Korean independence.
                            Although we understand some of the problems which led the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> military leaders to consider a coup
                            necessary, we are concerned about the future. The Secretary stated that
                            the defense of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> depends on (1)
                            its military strength and the determination of the Korean people to
                            defend themselves, and (2) the attitude of the rest of the world toward
                            Korea.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary said that we are frankly puzzled and uncertain about the
                            future course of events in Korea.<note n="2" xml:id="d234fn2">At 4:05

                                closely together. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> stated
                                that there might be some danger of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> military taking over the country without the
                                knowledge of the U.N. Commander. (Memorandum of conversation; ibid.,
                                795.00/7-761)</note> We have not felt that our represent-atives in
                            Korea or here were in intimate contact with those exercising real power
                            and authority in Korea. The Secretary stressed the need to discuss many
                            important problems with those in power and hoped that we could stimulate
                            such contact in the near future. We desire to show a spirit of
                            cooperation and partnership. There are points on which we would like to
                            offer advice, areas in which we feel we can assist progress in the
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>. However we need to know that we
                            are working with those in real authority, and it is difficult for us to
                            know how best to proceed. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName> has taken the initiative to consult with Korean
                            leaders and we hope they will discuss with him their plans and
                            intentions. The Secretary also emphasized that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName> enjoys the full confidence of
                            the President and himself and that the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> leaders can rely on Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName> to work for the best relations
                            between the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> and the U.S.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary thought that it would be useful if in the next few weeks
                            the Korean leaders could show that they are prepared to exercise
                            authority through processes of law and through the application of
                            procedures and standards general to constitutional governments elsewhere
                            in the world. If the impression is given that the new <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Government is acting arbitrarily or
                            taking actions not based on generally recognized concepts of legality
                            and justice, the result might well be to undermine confidence in the
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> and alienate the sympathy of
                            many who wish Korea well. The <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> has
                            enjoyed considerable international support over the years. This is a
                            valuable resource which we hope will not be dissipated. Our own policy,
                            interests, military forces and reputation are deeply involved in the
                            success or failure of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Chung said that Ambassador Yoo during his visit here had been
                            able to gain a clear understanding of the views of the U.S. Government,
                            Congress and people and his imminent return to Seoul would ensure the
                            prompt transmittal of our views to the Korean Government. Ambassador
                            Chung said that he was very hopeful that a “good reaction” would ensue
                            for both the U.S. and the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>.
                            Ambassador Yoo said that “weak as my position is” he would do whatever
                            he could to impress on his colleagues what needs to be done in the
                            future.</p>

                                6, the Department stated that recent events in Korea—the ouster and
                                detention of General Chang To-yong, his replacement by Pak
                                Chung-hui, and sweeping government accusations against the former
                                    <persName corresp="#p_CM1">Chang Myon</persName> government of
                                Communist connections—were causing concern in Washington. The
                                tentative Department assessment was that <persName corresp="#p_CM1">Chang</persName>'s ouster was inevitable and the accusations
                                against <persName corresp="#p_CM1">Chang Myon</persName> and
                                associates were an attempt to weaken the opposition to the junta.
                                The Department worried about the loss of Chang To-yong's moderating
                                influence on the <gloss target="#t_SCNR1">SCNR</gloss> and asked for
                                the Embassy's assessment. (Ibid., 795B.00/7-761)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. This is interim evaluation in response your telegram.</p>
                        <p>2. Revolution now in its second stage with General Pak Chung-hui
                            increasing his authority and control within Supreme Council and engaged
                            in eliminating elements which he thinks threatening him.</p>
                        <p>A. His aim clearly is to unify Supreme Council into homogeneous group
                            loyal to him and what he hopes to achieve.</p>
                        <p>B. At same time he is taking steps to break up possible anti-Pak
                            combinations in armed forces which he thinks could threaten him from
                            outside.</p>
                        <p>C. He is also continuing to move against civilian leaders and
                            organizations which he believes could become centers of organized
                            opposition. (For example after announcing three days ago four relief
                            pension and loan measures for veterans and their survivors, Supreme
                            Council dissolved National Veterans' Organization.)</p>
                        <p>3. For better or for worse we must let this phase of revolution work
                            itself out. Inexorable forces are at work and no useful purpose would be
                            served at this juncture by our trying apply heavy pressure to alter play
                            of these forces. First of all, Pak literally fighting for his life and
                            we would almost certainly not be listened to. Secondly, assuming we
                            successful in moderating or slowing down purges it would merely result
                            in continuation of internal factionalism and postponement of eventual
                            showdown inside Supreme Council, perpetuation and possibly accentuation
                            of division in armed forces, and further delays in taking economic
                            decisions, which now an immediate necessity if whole economy, already
                            staggering under impact of revolution, is not to collapse. Thirdly,
                            undue pressures on Pak at this critical juncture might lead him take
                            more repressive measures that would separate this government further
                            from its citizens and from U.S. and might invite countercoups and bloody
                            civil strife with <pb n="497" xml:id="pg_497" facs="0533"/>no acceptable
                            politicians and few institutions to salvage ruins. What Pak ultimately
                            aims for or will be able to accomplish, I do not know, but he is
                            strongest figure in situation, has a clear sense of nature and use of
                            power, and seems genuinely motivated by patriotic ideals. He
                            nevertheless will bear watching.</p>
                        <p>4. Meanwhile, Pak is fully aware of importance restoring CINC-<gloss target="#t_UNC1">UNC</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            forces command authority, has taken some constructive steps in this
                            direction (see Embtel 35, paras 3 and 4)<note n="2" xml:id="d235fn2">Paragraph 3 of telegram 35 from Seoul, July 7, reported that
                                General Pak told <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName>,
                                General <persName corresp="#p_MGGS1">Meloy</persName>, and General
                                    <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> that with the
                                ouster of 30 General Army officers the purge of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Armed Forces was over, that
                                military officers assigned to civilian duties would be replaced by
                                civilians, that the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> military
                                chain of command was in effect, and that soldiers charged with
                                police functions had been ordered to stop browbeating the public. In
                                paragraph 4 Meloy welcomed these assurances, which he believed would
                                help reestablish command authority. (Ibid.)</note> and has given
                            General <persName corresp="#p_MGGS1">Meloy</persName> and me assurances
                            this whole problem must be and will be resolved soon. But he cannot in
                            my opinion resolve command authority problem without regard to his own
                            problems described in para 2 above. Pak has also taken some constructive
                            measures to cope with corruption and social evils.</p>
                        <p>5. Supreme Council charges of Communist associations levelled against
                                <persName corresp="#p_CM1">Chang Myon</persName> and some of his
                            ministers and senior officials is a serious tactical mistake both from
                            domestic and international point of view and is of questionable utility
                            in terms of consolidating revolution. (Quite apart from fact that
                            published evidence is unconvincing, these charges merely deepen
                            prevailing atmosphere of apprehension and add to public concern here and
                            abroad over how far Pak is going in direction of retaliation and
                            repression.)</p>
                        <p>6. It is clear Pak's purpose in bringing charges is to discredit
                                <persName corresp="#p_CM1">Chang Myon</persName> government but why
                            he chose this means when he could have charged them with corruption or
                            tolerating corruption, ineffectiveness, incompetence, etc. is less
                            clear. Probably he not only wants discredit them, but means to get them
                            out of way. Additionally, I think Pak genuinely convinced that Communist
                            propaganda and neutralism were making an impression in South Korea under
                                <persName corresp="#p_CM1">Chang Myon</persName> govt. especially
                            among students, labor unions and intellectuals, and he means use any
                            evidence, however tenuous, to prove his case and to display his
                            anti-communism.</p>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_GM1">Green</persName> and I feel that in
                            formulating our public position and approach we must be ever mindful of
                            our relations with Koreans as a whole and that Pak may be passing
                            phenomenon. At same time we face fact there is no alternative at present
                            to giving Pak our support and trying to encourage restraint and wisdom
                            in his exercise of his growing power. In dealing with this dilemma our
                            tactic at this end up to now has been to <pb n="498" xml:id="pg_498" facs="0534"/>avoid public statements, and to try to moderate Pak
                            through my personal talks with him, Foreign Minister and economic
                            ministers; through <persName corresp="#p_GM1">Green</persName>'s
                            contacts with one or two who are close to Pak; through [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>]
                            talks with Col. <persName>Kim</persName>, head of Intelligence, and
                            apparently second strongest man in junta.</p>
                        <p>8. We feel that we must now give some public indication of our concern.
                            Accordingly suggest following procedure:<note n="3" xml:id="d235fn3">In

                        <p>The Estimate</p>
                        <p>I. Introduction</p>
                        <p>1. The members of the military junta now ruling the Republic of Korea
                                (<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>) are tough, nationalistic, and
                            ambitious. They have all spent their adult lives in military service and
                            most of them have had extensive combat experience. Their approach is not
                            that of the intellectual or the professional politician. They are
                            activists who have demonstrated an understanding of the instruments and
                            techniques for political control. They have long been disgusted with
                            corruption and inefficiency in the government and the military
                            establishment and disillusioned with the lack of progress under civilian
                            rule. Their approach to government is authoritarian and they are
                            convinced that the solution of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>'s
                            many economic, political, and social ills requires rigid public
                            discipline and firm, centralized government control.</p>
                        <p>2. The members of the military junta still feel that their position is
                            insecure. Consequently, they are suspicious and quick to suppress any
                            potential source of opposition. There are almost certainly elements of
                            vindictiveness and bitterness in their attitude toward Korean
                            politicians and military officers who have served as tools of the
                            politicians.</p>
                        <p>3. The <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>'s new ruling group intends to
                            bring a new order and discipline into Korean life and to initiate a
                            major economic development effort. While the ruling group desires close
                            relations with the US, it intends to run Korean affairs in its own way
                            and to assert Korean independence. <pb n="500" xml:id="pg_500" facs="0536"/>At least for the near future, the group has no
                            intention of turning the government back to civilian control or of
                            reinstating institutions of representative government despite assurances
                            to the contrary. They are only beginning to realize the complexities of
                            the tasks which face them and the limitations of their own training and
                            experience. Frustration of their efforts is likely to cause them to
                            resort to ill-considered or repressive acts.</p>
                        <p>II. Locus of Power</p>
                        <p>4. Major General Pak Chong-hui is the dominant figure in the military
                            junta, but his control of the group is neither absolute now nor certain
                            to continue. The recent removal of Lt. Gen. Chang To-yong eliminated the
                            most likely member of the coup group around whom antijunta military
                            elements might have gathered. <persName corresp="#p_CM1">Chang</persName>'s departure, however, did little to resolve the
                            basic problem of control within the coup group. We believe that
                            conflicts are continuing within the junta concerning policies and
                            tactics, and perhaps, objectives.</p>
                        <p>5. Although there are various possible factional alignments within the
                            junta based on regional origin or service, the potential division which
                            is most apparent at present lies in the difference between the general
                            officers and the field grade officers. There is a group of some 10 or 12
                            members of the junta—most of them Colonels—who provided much of the
                            coup's initial impetus and planning and who probably differ with Pak on
                            junta policies. In general, these officers tend to favor drastic
                            measures to achieve their objectives and to suppress opposition.</p>
                        <p>6. [<hi rend="italic">8 lines of 2-column source text not
                                declassified</hi>] Pak has indicated that he intends to curb the
                            influence of the Colonels, possibly by ousting them altogether or by
                            assigning them to army commands with promotions. Pak may be sufficiently
                            adroit to accomplish this without causing the Colonels to turn against
                            him. There is, however, a possibility that there may be an open break
                            between Pak and the Colonels group. If such a break occurred, the
                            outcome would depend on whether [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of
                                source text not</hi>
                            <hi rend="italic">declassified</hi>] chose to support Pak or the field
                            grade officers in the junta and in the army with whom he has close
                            ties.</p>
                        <p>7. There will probably be a continuing struggle for power within the
                            junta as various factions vie for influence and as Pak strives to
                            consolidate his position. Besides the Colonels faction, there is a
                            Marine Corps group, headed by Major General Kim Tong-ha, and other
                            opposition groups may emerge. There will probably be efforts to
                            compromise and settle differences, but if open conflict breaks out, we
                            cannot exclude the possibility that the various faction leaders would
                            call upon their supporters in the armed forces. This in turn would be
                            likely to create an opening for action by <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> military commanders who disapprove of the junta. This
                            could result in armed clashes and even civil war.</p>
                        <pb n="501" xml:id="pg_501" facs="0537"/>
                        <p>III. The Communism Issue</p>
                        <p>8. Despite the accusations that have been leveled against Pak and some of
                            the other members of the junta, we still have no hard evidence from
                            credible, disinterested sources that they are in fact Communists or are
                            consciously acting as North Korean agents. In its statements and actions
                            to date, the regime has taken a strong anti-Communist stand. Moreover,
                            Bloc press reports and broadcasts have bitterly attacked the junta, its
                            actions, and Pak personally. We recognize that the junta position and
                            Bloc reaction could be an attempt to conceal the true character of the
                            regime. We cannot rule out the possibility that the coup was Communist
                            inspired and directed, but presently available evidence leads us to the
                            view that the junta as a whole was, and continues to be, motivated
                            primarily by personal ambition, intense nationalism, and a strong desire
                            to impose discipline and force development on the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>IV. National Attitude Toward the Junta</p>
                        <p>9. The junta has passed a new basic law, virtually suspending the
                            Constitution of the Second Republic and setting itself up as both the
                            maker and executor of the nation's laws. Under this law, the junta's
                            Supreme Council for National Reconstruction is to approve the
                            appointment of all judicial officials and all formerly elected local
                            governing officers, such as province governors and town mayors. The
                            civil rights of the people are guaranteed only as long as they do not
                            conflict with the accomplishment of the Supreme Council's program. At
                            the same time, the Supreme Council has restored much of their previous
                            authority and power to the National Police and other control organs.</p>
                        <p>10. When it first seized control, the coup group enjoyed some meas-ure of
                            acceptance from the Korean public which had grown weary of the <persName corresp="#p_CM1">Chang Myon</persName> government's inability to
                            subordinate politicking to economic and political reform. Over the past
                            two months, however, public disenchantment with the new regime has
                            appeared in the cities. Some of the junta's early administrative acts
                            favored the farmers and in the rural areas a favorable attitude toward
                            the junta can still be found. The economic dislocation resulting from
                            the coup has not yet had a measurable political effect on the public,
                            but it will almost certainly add to other causes of public
                            dissatisfaction with the junta if not soon rectified. The increasing
                            authoritarianism and resort to police rule is adversely affecting the
                            junta's standing among intellectuals and students. Many of the latter
                            now regard the military junta as little or no better than the <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> regime they overthrew.</p>
                        <p>11. The junta has made full use of its powers under martial law to close
                            newspapers, jail politicians, educators, and businessmen, and impose
                            curfews and censorship. The atmosphere of fear and intimidation thus
                            created has so far prevented demonstrations of public opposition <pb n="502" xml:id="pg_502" facs="0538"/>to the junta. The junta's
                            campaign against potential opposition leaders has greatly reduced the
                            chances for organized resistance. Another student-led uprising is
                            possible. If it were to take place, the junta would probably attempt to
                            put it down quickly and violently, and follow up with increased
                            repressive measures.</p>
                        <p>V. Relations With the US </p>
                        <p>12. With the assumption of power by the military junta, US-<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> relations have entered a new phase. The
                            cooperativeness of the <persName corresp="#p_CM1">Chang Myon</persName>
                            government has been replaced by suspicion and distrust. Being personally
                            convinced of the imperative need to rid the country of rule by
                            ineffectual and corrupt politicians, the members of the junta probably
                            were dismayed by and resentful of the initial US opposition to the
                            takeover. Much of this sentiment still remains and the coup group
                            probably feels that its cool, reserved, and suspicious attitude toward
                            the US is but a reflection of the official US attitude toward them. [<hi rend="italic">5 lines of source text not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>13. The members of the military junta are fully aware of Korean
                            dependence upon the US and will seek a relationship with the US which
                            will not endanger the country's major source of economic, military, and
                            diplomatic support. At the same time, the military junta probably
                            intends to develop a new and different US-<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> relationship in which South Korea's leaders will feel
                            that they are in full control of Korean affairs. The junta will be less
                            responsive to US advice in political matters, and almost certainly
                            intends to go about the tasks of reform and political control in its own
                            way. US appeals for leniency for individuals or groups considered by the
                            junta to be corrupt or to be opponents of its regime might be
                            interpreted as interference in Korean affairs.</p>
                        <p>14. The junta has accepted the principle of the subordination of the
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Army to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Command. However, their willingness to
                            implement fully agreements on the command structure cannot be taken for
                            granted. US forces in the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> probably
                            will be faced with increasing restrictions and problems of maintaining
                            good relations with the Korean authorities. While recognizing the
                            military necessities of the situation, the junta probably intends to

                                Seoul, July 15, the Embassy reported the results of an investigation
                                of the May 1961 military coup. The investigation found that the
                                “mainsprings” of the revolt were “patriotic, nationalistic, and
                                anti-communist.” Disgust with corruption, incompetence, and
                                ineffectiveness of the civilian government and fear of possible
                                Communist subversion caused the revolt. Although the Embassy did not
                                discount the possibility of “communist sleepers” among the
                                revolutionary leaders and their civilian advisers, it felt that
                                General Pak Chun-hui's defection from communism was legitimate.

                        <p>DEAR SAM: One of the continuing problems which has concerned the
                            President, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>,
                            and me for some time is how to assure that the effectiveness and cost of
                            our military assistance programs are consistent with the role to be
                            played by U.S. forces and our major new efforts in other foreign
                            programs, including economic aid. Our recent experience in presenting
                            the President's new aid legislation to the Congress<note n="1" xml:id="d238fn1">Which became Public Law 87-195, the Foreign
                                Assistance Act of 1961, approved September 4. (75 Stat 424)</note>
                            indicates that influential members of the legislative branch are
                            similarly concerned.</p>
                        <p>We recognize the need to provide military assistance where necessary in
                            our continuing security interests. In our view, however, many of our
                            country programs reflect habits of thinking and methods of operation
                            built up over the years which do not come fully to grips with the range
                            of problems and opportunities which confront us. A realistic
                            reassessment of these country programs in context of our political,
                            economic, and military policies is imperative, bringing the whole
                            spectrum of external and internal threats and capabilities into focus to
                            determine the optimum thrust and balance of our overall effort.</p>
                        <p>The military review must be also related specifically to the current
                            major reassessment of our economic aid activities requested in my
                            Circular Airgram 1065 of June 23, 1961.<note n="2" xml:id="d238fn2">Not

                            evaluated before our economic judgments can become final, just as we
                            must know probable economic resource capabilities and demands thereon
                            before we decide on our military programs.</p>
                        <p>As a first major step in this process, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and I have determined that a special priority
                            should be given to a review of our programs in seven major aid-recipient
                            countries—Korea, China, Vietnam, Pakistan, Iran, Turkey, and Greece. An
                            interagency Steering Group, chaired by State, with representatives from
                            Defense, <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>, and the Joint Staff, has
                            been established to supervise this review separate from the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1962-67 military assistance planning now
                            in progress (CW-608 of July 21, 1961).<note n="3" xml:id="d238fn3">Not

                        <p>As you are aware from your participation in the Korean Task Force
                            meetings our recently established policy assumes that, in both U.S. and
                            Korean activities, priority should be given to the crucial internal
                            problems and to the contributions which the Korean military
                            establishment might make to economic development. Also as indicated in
                            the Task Force Report,<note n="4" xml:id="d238fn4">See the source note,
                                    <ref target="#d225">Document 225</ref>.</note> the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> is reviewing <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> force levels and assessing their missions and strategic

                            will be in a position to provide a background combining all factors
                            relevant to U.S. interests and decisions on longer term goals. In
                            addition, this re-evaluation of military assistance would extend the
                            review period to <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1967, stressing the
                            need to examine the policy alternatives both for the U.S. and those
                            which may be feasible for Korea, and would seek to evaluate the risks
                            and consequences of those alternatives and the military and economic aid
                            measures related thereto, and to point up the optimum distribution of
                            total resources in the U.S. and Korean interest.</p>
                        <p>For this review to be effective, your personal appraisal beyond the
                            contributions of your associates, will be required and should be
                            directed primarily at long-term aspects of our military assistance
                            policies. While short-run considerations must be included in our
                            planning, we are chief-ly interested in where you believe we should be
                            by 1967.</p>
                        <p>To this end we are seeking the most informed answers to the types of
                            questions, among others, presented for Korea in the first enclosure to
                            this letter to assure ourselves that we are following the most promising
                            course in relating military assistance to our overall objectives and
                            other U.S. programs over the next few years. The answers may, of course,
                            be provided separately or within the framework of a general response to
                            the issues raised, whichever is considered to be most effective. I hope
                            as well that the particular questions will not limit the scope of the
                            response.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps the most important question is whether, despite the continuing
                            risk of renewed local aggression, we should not somewhat reduce the size
                            of the military aid insurance policy we are buying in South Korea in
                            order to direct greater U.S. and indigenous resources to meet the
                            crucial need for dynamic social and economic growth. Though to do so
                            might involve taking greater calculated risks with respect to <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> military defenses, the continued
                            presence of substantial U.S. forces plus the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> umbrella might suffice to reduce this risk to acceptable
                            proportions. These are questions for your judgment.</p>
                        <p>Alternatives to the basic guidance used in preparation of the revised
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 62-67 plan, attached as enclosure
                            2 of this letter, have been formulated to provide a practical framework
                            for judging the consequences of <pb n="507" xml:id="pg_507" facs="0543"/>military program adjustments on costs and other factors in the context
                            of other programs. Your views on these alternatives will also be
                            solicited directly by <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss>
                            through regular military assistance channels. A copy of your reply
                            should go to him for consideration of the military consequences. These
                            are clearly not the only possible alternatives, and we would welcome
                            your views on any other you think desirable. All of this, of course,
                            must be treated as an internal U.S. exercise.</p>
                        <p>I realize that this intensive review, coming on top of other requests for
                            economic analyses and regular military assistance program reviews, will
                            put a heavy burden on you and your associates since I would appreciate
                            having your response by September 1 if possible. I also realize,
                            however, the particular difficulties you are now facing and can well
                            understand that you may feel a look into the next five years would not
                            appear either practicable or worthwhile at this moment. If such should
                            be the case, I would appreciate your view of an appropriate time to
                            accomplish this task. I would hope on the other hand that this would not
                            be too long delayed for we are faced with the need very soon to take a
                            number of basic decisions on the nature and volume of military and
                            economic aid to be programmed in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 62
                            and that to be requested of the Congress in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 63.</p>
                        <p>With warmest personal regards,</p>

                        <p>PROPOSED MAP QUESTIONNAIRE FOR KOREA</p>
                        <p>I. What alternative political developments may occur in Korea in the
                            planning period with respect to such issues as unification, alliances,
                            form of government?</p>
                        <p>A. How do these relate to U.S. national interest?</p>
                        <p>B. How do they relate to policy goals of the communist bloc?</p>
                        <p>C. What military and economic requirements are associated with such
                            developments?</p>
                        <pb n="508" xml:id="pg_508" facs="0544"/>
                        <p>II. How can military assistance policies and programs contribute to
                            overall U.S. aims in Korea?</p>
                        <p>A. What are the military, economic, political, and social threats to U.S.
                            interests in Korea over the planning period; which of these are likely
                            to be the most serious; against which should (a) U.S., and (b) Korean
                            resources be focused?</p>
                        <p>B. What positive contributions can <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            forces make to the healthy development of Korea in the next few years
                            and how can <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> programs encourage such
                            contributions?</p>
                        <p>C. Can <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> policy have any influence with
                            the <gloss target="#t_SCNR1">SCNR</gloss> on the issue of civilian
                            participation in government?</p>
                        <p>D. What are the probable future military command relationships (<gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, US, <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>)
                            and how will these relationships affect military requirements and MAP
                            policy?</p>
                        <p>III. What role for <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces will best
                            serve U.S. interests?</p>
                        <p>A. Should this role be limited to meeting the threat from North Korea and
                            maintaining internal security?</p>
                        <p>B. If larger forces are to be maintained what considerations should limit
                            their size.</p>
                        <p>C. Does the “<gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> umbrella”—<gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> command structure, demilitarized zone,
                            and U.S. forces in Korea and nearby—contribute a sufficient deterrent to
                            communist attack even if the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces
                            were to be considerably reduced.</p>
                        <p>D. Should <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces be considered for
                            deployment outside of the area?</p>
                        <p>IV. In the context of fundamental internal problems, what should be our
                            approach to the threat of communist aggression against Korea from North
                            Korea and Communist China?</p>
                        <p>A. How might the chances of successful aggression relate to the internal
                            situation?</p>
                        <p>B. To what extent is Korea capable of developing forces to defeat such
                            aggression?</p>
                        <p>C. What risks are involved in maintaining an imbalance in <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces (e.g., lack of air force
                            strength) and do U.S. policy considerations justify a continuation of
                            this imbalance. Will U.S. and <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> forces
                            continue to be required in support of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> to meet external aggression in any event?</p>
                        <p>D. What limits should be placed on the provision of modern and
                            dual-capable weapons to <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> armed
                            forces? What are the costs and risks in such a military emphasis?</p>
                        <p>E. What added local facilities and military capabilities would be
                            required to permit the introduction of larger <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> or U.S. forces in defense of Korea?</p>
                        <pb n="509" xml:id="pg_509" facs="0545"/>
                        <p>V. How should the U.S. approach areas of difference between the U.S. and
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> views on military requirements
                            and priorities?</p>
                        <p>A. What are the prospects of current <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            thinking on defense policies changing over the next five years?</p>
                        <p>B. What are the consequences and risks involved if divergent US/<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> views on military policies developed,
                            e.g., is the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> likely to launch an
                            attack against North Korea; rely on its own resources in the event of a
                            withdrawal or reduction in military assistance at the expense of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> economic and social development?</p>
                        <p>C. What risks are involved for the U.S. if we accept fully <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> views on military requirements and
                            priorities?</p>
                        <p>D. What are the prospects for changing the primary emphasis of U.S.
                            programs from military to economic and what U.S. measures would be
                            required to do this.</p>
                        <p>VI. Faced with severe limitations of local human, material, financial and
                            institutional resources, how should local and external resources be
                            distributed across the spectrum of possible uses (military, economic,
                            and social) to achieve the desired long-term results of national
                            strength and independence?</p>
                        <p>Enclosure 2<note n="7" xml:id="d238fn7">Confidential.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>ALTERNATIVES TO MILITARY ASSISTANCE FOR KOREA</p>
                        <p>I. Alternatives:</p>
                        <p>The following proposals are alternatives to guidance used in preparation
                            of the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 62-67 MAP as per CW 608 of July
                            21, 1961 which includes, inter alia, retaining ground forces at the
                            current level and providing equipment comparable in effectiveness to
                            that possessed by forces of neighboring communist states. Further it
                            should be assumed that there will be progressive reductions in
                            supporting assistance throughout this period.</p>
                        <p>A. Alternative #1:</p>
                        <p>Provide only maintenance support for current <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Armed Forces for period 62-67, thus deferring currently
                            planned force improvements, including the provision of complex and
                            sophisticated weapon systems; i.e., missile systems and F-104
                            aircraft.</p>
                        <pb n="510" xml:id="pg_510" facs="0546"/>
                        <p>B. Alternative #2:</p>
                        <p>Reduce the current 600,000 <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Armed
                            Force by 50,000 men annually during the planning period <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 62-67; thus limiting U.S. military
                            assistance support of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> armed forces
                            to 350,000 men commencing <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 68. This
                            reduction in force and loss in combat capability is to be effected
                            without off-setting modernization.</p>
                        <p>II. Assessment of Alternatives:</p>
                        <p>For each alternative under I above, a summary of Country Team assessments
                            should be provided covering as a minimum the following:</p>
                        <p>A. The estimated political, military, and economic consequences of each
                            alternative.</p>
                        <p>B. A determination of the U.S. and country political, military, and
                            economic measures which would be necessary if the alternatives were to
                            be implemented.</p>
                        <p>C. A feasible time schedule for the implementation of the
                            alternatives.</p>
                        <p>D. The order of magnitude costs of each alternative on the country and on
                            military assistance, and supporting and other economic assist-ance
                            programs for the period <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 62-67.</p>
                        <p>E. An estimate of the interrelationship of each alternative with
                            currently proposed development assistance requirements (CG 1066 of 23
                            June 61 and replies thereto).</p>

                                constitutional provisions. The government would begin drafting a new
                                constitution and electoral law in October 1962, hold a referendum on
                                the constitution in March 1963, and hold general elections for a
                                president and a unicameral legislature in May 1963. Included in the
                                program was an “Qualifications Examination Board” to approve
                                candidates for elections. <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName> advised the <gloss target="#t_SCNR1">SCNR</gloss> that the board was a poor idea as it would be open

                                Pak Chong-hui and Prime Minister Song over the weekend and used the
                                opportunity to talk about restoration of civilian rule. Pak claimed
                                there was no difference of opinion in the <gloss target="#t_SCNR1">SCNR</gloss> about the principle of restoration, just about
                                timing. He promised to send <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName> a plan for restoration. Song thought the
                                restoration's timing was a difficult matter. If it came too soon, it
                                would only restore incompetent and corrupt politicans and encourage
                                factionalism. In light of Pak's promise of a plan, <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName> thought that the Department
                                should hold the Secretary's letter in abeyance. (Telegram 250 from

                        <p>During the last two or three days I have been trying to catch up on the
                            situation with respect to the implementation of the Task Force report on
                            Korea. It is very difficult, on the basis of available telegrams, to get
                            any clear picture of where we stand in the implementation of the Task
                            Force recommendations. The best message on this subject is the attached

                        <p>You will note from this message that we have released the $28 million in
                            remaining defense support assistance funds for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1961. We are currently involved in consideration of who
                            should provide an economic team to go to Korea. We have not, so far as I
                            have been able to determine, indicated our general willingness to aid
                            the power industry and to support the National Construction Service. I
                            am sure that we have had some discussion of these subjects in <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> channels, but to my knowledge they have
                            not been raised in the manner authorized by Task Force recommendations
                            in conversations between the Ambassador and Korean officials.</p>
                        <p>On the matter of an economic team, as I indicated to you earlier, there
                            has been a controversy between State and <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> as to whom should be chosen. <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> has preferred the Arthur B. Little Company (economists
                            named <persName corresp="#p_CJH1">Cleveland</persName> and Bryce have
                            been mentioned); State has preferred RAND primarily because of the
                            apparent Korean preference for RAND. However there has been a recent
                                message<note n="2" xml:id="d240fn2">Not attached and not further
                                identified.</note> indicating that now the Koreans may prefer Arthur
                            B. Little (perhaps as a result of <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> missionary work
                            in Korea). State and <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> agreed
                            yesterday that RAND should do the job, subject however, to verifying
                            that RAND is preferred by the Koreans. Charles Wolfe is in Washington
                            today and tomorrow, discussing possible RAND participation with State
                            and <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>. The <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> case against retention of RAND is contained in the
                            attached telegram.<note n="3" xml:id="d240fn3">

                            Force and which could be the basis for a Task Force discussion.</p>
                        <p>It is anticipated that the Task Force will have a meeting some time next

                                ability to defend itself. The Joint Chiefs concluded that although
                                the threat in Korea remained strong, there was no evidence that the
                                Communists would attack. <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces
                                were capable of maintaining internal security and defending against
                                minor incursions without assistance, but a successful defense of
                                South Korea would require the use of allied forces already deployed
                                there, <gloss target="#t_PACOM1">PACOM</gloss> air, and other
                                support. A successful counteroffensive could not be carried out with
                                existing forces. Current <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> force
                                levels of 600,000 were the “minimum acceptable” as was current
                                military assistance support. The Joint Chiefs recommended no changes

                            the Soviet Government was going to back popular regimes all over the

                            inevitably lose if we took this role against the will of the peoples.
                            The President, in turn, pointed out the hypocrisy of this statement in
                            that there was no Communist government currently in power which had
                            achieved its status through free elections. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had pointed to Korea as being vulnerable to
                            his kind of penetration and that the military orientation of the present
                            government made it susceptible to pressures from underneath such as
                            would be stimulated by <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                            himself.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary stated that the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> has a
                            stake in the opinions of other states forming the body of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. The importance of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to Korea has been demonstrated over a
                            considerable period, particularly in 1950, when a number of members
                            joined the U.S. in resisting invasion not just for policy reasons, but
                            also reflecting the general sentiment and opinion of the peoples. <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> has needed <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> support in the past and may need it in the future. It
                            is, therefore, vital for the safety and security of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> that it engender respect among the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> peoples.</p>
                        <p>The foregoing two comments, the Secretary said, were connected with the
                            moves presently contemplated by the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            toward reestablishment of constitutional government, and have a bearing
                            on what will be shortly announced regarding elections. The Secretary
                            expressed concern should elections be announced for as far away as 1963.
                            Such a date would raise doubts whether this was indeed a serious
                            proposal and whether the step was actually contemplated by the
                            government.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary suggested consideration by <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> of scheduling elections before the 1962 General
                            Assembly meeting. He said that how the Korean question came before this
                            year's General Assembly was not particularly serious, it being
                            understood that the new government must have time to formulate and begin
                            implementation of its governmental planning. It was reasonable to expect
                            other governments would adopt a wait-and-see policy; however, this
                            attitude would undoubtedly run out by the end of one year.</p>
                        <p>Indicating he had not discussed this idea with his colleagues, the
                            Secretary wondered whether, if the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss>
                            did not feel it could announce elections before 1963, it might consider
                            not specifying a date. The date of May 1963 might give the impression
                            that the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> feared elections. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MCWP1">McConaughy</persName> thought there was
                            something to be said for deferring announcing a specific date, but that
                            it was our understanding that the Korean public were eagerly
                            anticipating a specific announcement on August 14, and omitting a
                            timetable would be a great disappointment. Ambassador Chung seconded
                            this and the idea was dropped. In this connection, the Secretary
                            inquired of the Ambassador how he felt the Korean people would react to
                            the 1963 date. Ambassador replied it was hard to answer this definitely.
                            He had been away on a trip until a few <pb n="515" xml:id="pg_515" facs="0551"/>days ago and he had left Korea over four years ago, so
                            he did not feel in a position to make a judgment.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary emphasized the spirit in which he made his comments. It was
                            not up to the U.S. to say “when” but he considered it a friendly act to
                            point out to the Ambassador the effect of the proposed election date on
                            other countries and on the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss>'s
                            international relations. Such a long postponement would undoubtedly be
                            picked up by the communists and used in their propaganda. We have been
                            encouraged by the progress made so far by the present government but he
                            felt he ought to express our feeling of concern over the matter of
                            election date. The decision was, however, entirely an <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> matter. The Secretary realized the
                            great concern the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> felt on this
                            matter, and the fact that it must balance many things. He hoped that the
                                <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> would take into account the
                            fact that the date for elections will have an influence on the
                            international position of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>. Many
                            governments to whom the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> has and will
                            turn to for friendship are concerned over this matter, have consulted
                            with us, and are anxious to see a steady progression to constitutional
                            status.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador thanked the Secretary for his advice. He did not feel in a
                            position to give a definite answer, but he would try his best to
                            influence his government and advise it in accordance with the
                            Secretary's wishes.<note n="3" xml:id="d241fn3">On August 21-22 Major

                            along these lines to the press on July 27.<note n="3" xml:id="d242fn3">See <ref target="#d237fn2">footnote 2, Document 237</ref>.</note>

                        <p>1 c. Done by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName> and
                            by the Secretary in his July 27 press statement (see 1 a above).</p>
                        <p>1 d. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName> has made
                            this clear to Korean leaders and has provided a senior U.S. economic
                            adviser to General Pak Chong-hui, i.e., in mid-July Mr. Albert Boucher
                            of <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> was temporarily detailed to
                            this advisory position on a full-time basis. At Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName>'s request, the State Department
                            is actively recruiting the services of a team of top-flight economic
                            advisers to assist the Supreme Council in the formulation of Korea's
                            long-range development program (also see 4 d).</p>
                        <p>1 e. The new Korean Government on May 26 agreed to restore <gloss target="#t_CINCUNC1">CINCUNC</gloss>'s operational control over the
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> armed forces, and <gloss target="#t_CINCUNC1">CINCUNC</gloss>'s operational control appears
                            to be essentially restored in practice. Moreover, Embassy Seoul has
                            recently reported that General <persName corresp="#p_MGGS1">Meloy</persName> is receiving “excellent cooperation” in this
                            field.</p>
                        <p>2. On August 12, Chairman Pak announced that the Korean Government would
                            be turned back to civilian control in 1963 under a presidential system
                            with a smaller unicameral legislature in accordance with a time schedule
                            calling for a new constitution before March 1963 and <pb n="517" xml:id="pg_517" facs="0553"/>general elections in May 1963. Although
                            this timetable is somewhat slower than we would have preferred, General
                            Pak's announcement does represent a step in the right direction in that
                            it provides a public commitment to return to representative
                            constitutional government by a specific time.</p>
                        <p>3. The authorization to invite the chief of Government to Washington was
                            originally prepared in the context of the announced desire of the
                            previous Prime Minister, General <persName corresp="#p_CYCDY1">Chang
                                Do-young</persName>, to do so and has since been held in abeyance
                            until the attitude of his successor should become clear. The new Prime
                            Minister, General <persName corresp="#p_SY1">Song Yo-chan</persName>, is
                            at present only a front man and completely subordinate to Supreme
                            Council Chairman Pak, who has now indicated that he would like to visit
                            Washington, briefly and informally, perhaps in late October or early
                            November. In the meantime the Department has informed Embassy Seoul that
                            we would be prepared to consider such a request, but that the
                            President's schedule would probably preclude a visit before November. We
                            are now awaiting Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName>'s further recommendations.</p>
                        <p>4. The Korean Government has publicly expressed its intention to carry
                            out the economic reform program agreed to by the previous regime,
                            including maintenance of a unified exchange rate at 1300 hwan per
                            dollar. (The new exchange rate system has not yet been implemented to
                            the Embassy's complete satisfaction—see Embtel 106, July 19).<note n="4" xml:id="d242fn4">Not printed. (Department of State, Central Files,

                            reorganized into a single corporation for improved administration. New
                            and improved credit facilities have been established, banking and price
                            controls generally eliminated, leading businessmen released from
                            detention, and other actions taken to engender business confidence and
                            stimulate the economy. In a recent message (Deptel 165, August 1)<note n="5" xml:id="d242fn5">The quote is not from telegram 165 to Seoul,

                                develop and implement promptly effective measures to solve Korea's
                                economic problems. (Ibid.) The quote is taken from the Embassy's
                                response to telegram 165, telegram 206 from Seoul, August 1. (Ibid.,

                            leave little doubt of its ability to develop and instate measures and
                            establish machinery to deal with present economic problems.” However,
                            economic confusion and stagnation continue; the private business sector
                            has still not regained confidence to move ahead; the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> has still not fully complied with the
                            economic undertakings of October, 1960; tax collections are lagging; and
                            increases in money supply may lead to inflation.</p>

                            requested waiver of the preferential U.S. procurement policy for
                            fertilizer; this matter is under <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>
                            consideration.</p>
                        <p>4 b. Expansion of electric power will receive high priority as soon as
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName> makes a
                            determination as to the eligibility of Korea for continuing
                            developmental assistance, based upon Korean willingness and ability to
                            carry out a long-range development program. Meanwhile, <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> has undertaken preliminary work on
                            several proposed power projects, in order to be in a position to take
                            immediate action on all pending loan applications as soon as the
                            “go-head” decision is taken. <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> is
                            engaged in preparing a long-range power development plan in conjunction
                            with the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> and Commonwealth
                            Associates.</p>
                        <p>4 c. Although the new regime has indicated plans to expand the National
                            Construction Service, the Embassy has reported that the program is not
                            fully under way; local currency financing appears to be the bottleneck.
                            Under present circumstances, it is doubtful that additional U.S. support
                            of the program is necessary or practicable. If and when it appears that
                            additional U.S. support can be advantageously utilized, it will be made
                            available to the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>4 d. The <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> is urgently attempting to
                            contract for a team of specialists to assist the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> in preparation of its Five-Year
                            Development Plan (see 1d above). The choice appears to be between the
                            RAND Corporation and the Arthur D. Little Company; a decision is
                            expected to be made within the next few days and the team should be in
                            Seoul within the next few weeks.</p>
                        <p>4 e. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName> has on
                            several occasions informed the Korean Government of the terms on which
                            developmental funds will be available. Commitments to the support of
                            specific undertakings necessarily await formulation of an agreed
                            Five-Year Development Plan. The draft plan prepared by the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss>, as it now stands, is hastily
                            prepared, and contains unrealistic assumptions.</p>
                        <p>5. Over the past year and one-half, <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss>/Korea has made a considerable reduction in its staff, and
                            it is considered desirable to await the new Director's arrival in Korea
                            (in early September) before undertaking further actions to streamline
                                <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> operations with a view to
                            eliminating unessential projects.</p>
                        <p>Category II: Subsequent U.S. Actions</p>
                        <p>6. The proposal to send a Special Envoy accompanied by a group of
                            economic advisers was directed toward a contingency situation which has
                            not yet arisen. In a recent cable (Embtel 146, July 24)<note n="6" xml:id="d242fn6">Not printed. (Ibid., 795B.00/7-2461)</note>
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName> stated that he
                            was not prepared to recommend at this time that the Department send a
                            Special Envoy and team on long-range economic <pb n="519" xml:id="pg_519" facs="0555"/>program as visualized in the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Paper, adding that this is something we
                            can do, if at all, later when we see how situation evolves and what
                            effect emergency economic measures have on the economy.</p>
                        <p>In regard to the question of consulting other Free World nations about
                            the possibility of contributing to a Korean Five-Year Development Plan,
                            Embassy Bonn has been alerted to our interest, but we feel that it is
                            premature to approach Japan on this subject, at least until <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> receptivity to such Japanese assistance
                            can be ascertained. It is doubtful that the Korean Government will be
                            willing to entertain Japanese offers of economic assistance until and
                            unless at least most of the basic issues outstanding between the two
                            countries have been resolved, particularly Korean claims against Japan.
                            (Our Embassy has recently reported a serious resolve on the part of the
                                <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> to resume negotiations with
                            Japan in the near future aimed at a settlement of basic issues.)</p>
                        <p>7. These announcements have not yet been made, not only because
                            Congressional appropriations have not yet been determined, but also
                            because while the Korean Government has consolidated the power
                            companies, administration of the power industry and its financial and
                            rate structure is still under Embassy/<gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> observation.</p>
                        <p>8. The question of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> force levels has
                            been reviewed by Defense on the basis of a preliminary assessment from
                            the field, and the Defense Department assessment thereof will be
                            transmitted to the State Department in the very near future.</p>
                        <p>9. This subject is included in the Defense assessment referred to in
                            paragraph 8 above.</p>
                        <p>10. The improvement of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>-Japan
                            relations was discussed with the Japanese Prime Minister during his
                            visit to Washington and has been discussed in a similar vein by
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName> in Seoul. It
                            has been made clear to the Japanese and Korean Governments that the
                            Japanese settlement of <gloss target="#t_GARIOA1">GARIOA</gloss> is not
                            to be related to U.S. and Japanese aid to Korea. We anticipate that
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>-Japanese relations will be
                            resumed in September or October. There are indications that the Korean
                            Government may have decided to seek solutions to outstanding issues, but
                            it is not clear whether the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> is
                            prepared to make realistic compromises with the Japanese or whether the
                            Japanese Government is yet prepared to reach settlements with the new
                            Korean Military Government so soon after the military coup.</p>
                        <p>11. These activities are subject to further review by <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> in the light of our developing
                            overall policy toward the new <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>Category III: Required Korean Actions</p>
                        <p>12 a. The Korean Government has issued a preliminary Five-Year Economic
                            Plan which is to be reviewed by a team of experts who will advise the
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Government in the plan's
                            implementation.</p>
                        <pb n="520" xml:id="pg_520" facs="0556"/>
                        <p>12 b. The <gloss target="#t_SCNR1">SCNR</gloss> Chairman, General Pak,
                            issued a statement on this subject on August 12, in which general
                            elections were scheduled for May 1963.</p>
                        <p>12 c. The Korean Government has indicated its intention to cooperate
                            fully with <gloss target="#t_CINCUNC1">CINCUNC</gloss>, who has stated
                            that he is now receiving “excellent cooperation” from Korean military
                            leaders.</p>
                        <p>12 d. General Pak has indicated that he intends to grant a large-scale
                            amnesty to many of those imprisoned after the coup and to deal leniently
                            with military leaders who did not cooperate with the coup. Moreover on
                            August 12 he promised to return the Government to civilian control in
                            1963 (see paragraph 2 above). In this connection, over 5,000 prisoners
                            were released on August 15, including former First Army Commander Lee
                            Han-lim.</p>
                        <p>12 e. The Korean Government has taken a number of actions specifically
                            designed to reduce usurious practices among the rural population.</p>
                        <p>12 f. The Korean Government has issued many decrees and taken many
                            actions which appear sincerely designed to root out corruption
                            throughout the Korean society.</p>

                        <p>The Problem</p>
                        <p>To estimate the major trends and prospects in South Korea, with
                            particular attention to the impact of North Korea on the south over the
                            next two or three years.</p>
                        <p>Conclusions</p>
                        <p>1. In its push to unify Korea under Communist control, the North Korean
                            regime will continue to depend primarily on subversive tactics <pb n="521" xml:id="pg_521" facs="0557"/>and propaganda appealing to
                            nationalistic sentiments and stressing the economic benefits of
                            unification. Although these efforts have had little effect, the
                            Communists probably believe their longer term prospects for a favorable
                            response to its unification appeals are good and improving. In view of
                            this and the automatic involvement of US forces in any resumption of
                            hostilities in Korea, we believe the Communists are not likely to assume
                            the grave risks of armed action against South Korea over the next
                            several years. (Paras. 12-25, 50-53)</p>
                        <p>2. The greatest threat to South Korea, at least in the near term, comes
                            from within South Korea. The country lacks a sense of national purpose
                            and faces both tremendous economic problems and a brittle political
                            situation. The military junta seeks to provide the drive and stability
                            which was lacking in the previous civilian government but is subject to
                            internal factionalism and lacks general public support in confronting
                            these enormous problems. (Paras. 28-38, 54)</p>
                        <p>3. The prospect for South Korea over the next few years is therefore very
                            cloudy and uncertain. US aid will probably succeed in preventing
                            economic collapse. However, even under the most favorable circumstances,
                            progress will be slow and South Korea will continue to require
                            large-scale foreign aid for the indefinite future if it is to remain an
                            independent nation allied with the West. (Paras. 39-42, 55)</p>
                        <p>4. The political situation is subject to sudden and rapid change. Much
                            depends on future actions of the junta, in particular, on its capacity
                            to establish a sense of forward momentum among the Korean people. If the
                            overall situation in South Korea fails to improve significantly and the
                            people lose hope for national progress, the continued enticements
                            offered by the North Korean regime could lead to some movement in the
                            south toward an accommodation with the north. (Paras. 23-33, 56)</p>

                        <p>2. Military government has now been in power five months. It has taken
                            hold with energy, earnestness, determination and imagination, albeit
                            with certain authoritarian and military characteristics which have
                            hampered its public image. Though it has no popular base and there is
                            little evidence of positive popular enthusiasm, it is nonetheless a
                            genuine revolution from the top trying to introduce sweeping reforms of
                            a most fundamental kind. Projects of reform long talked about or under
                            actual consideration by previous governments are becoming realities in
                            banking and credit policy, foreign trade, increased public works for
                            unemployed, tax evasion, agriculture, trade union organization,
                            education, public administration, social welfare (prison reform,
                            rehabilitation of prostitutes, birth control information, assistance to
                            veterans and their survivors) and other fields. Many reforms are
                            constructive and some long urged by American advisors. Others while
                            well-intentioned have been too hastily developed or are poorly
                            implemented. Some of these latter already undergone correction, for
                            government, at least in some cases, prepared admit and correct
                            mistakes.</p>
                        <p>3. Military government's efforts to deal with wholesale graft, bribery
                            and corruption in government and business, smuggling, large-scale
                            diversion of military supplies, hoodlum terror, and police and press <pb n="523" xml:id="pg_523" facs="0559"/>blackmail of individuals are
                            genuine and are producing results. Vigilance against communist
                            subversion and quality and volume anti-communist propaganda have greatly
                            improved.</p>
                        <p>4. Government administration, while improved in sense now possible get
                            rapid top-side decisions, suffering from continuous changes in
                            intermediate and senior personnel, but situation gradually stabilizing
                            this regard. Majority of Cabinet ministers with military background have
                            impressed us with their competence and effectiveness for administration.
                            Others less so. Physical breakdowns from overwork becoming problem.
                            PriMin has not been well for a month; Min of Comm and Ind Maj Gen
                            Chonghmae-hyok, one of ablest, collapsed from exhaustion at Cabinet
                            meeting but now back to work after two weeks rest. Chairman Economic
                            Planning Board and Vice Premier, Kim Yu-taek, ordered take two months
                            off. Chairman Pak himself showing some signs of strain from
                            overwork.</p>
                        <p>5. Increase in administrative efficiency arising from competence of able
                            ministers is handicapped by absence of clear division of responsibility
                            and functions between Supreme Council and Cabinet. Some Supreme Council
                            members are interfering and overriding Cabinet decisions and some
                            military ministers by-passing PriMin. This is producing frictions and in
                            some cases erratic decisions involving increased government
                            expenditures.</p>
                        <p> PriMin endeavoring establish that Supreme Council limit itself to
                            legislative functions and leave executive functions to Cabinet. He is
                            also endeavoring stop ministers from by-passing Cabinet. He is having
                            difficulty establishing these principles. One reason for this is he not
                            one of original coup group, is tainted by service during <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> regime, and is suspected of
                            harboring personal political ambitions.</p>
                        <p>6. Military government has its enemies, but it is not without support. If
                            it has little positive support, it can claim with justice that it does
                            considerable mass good will on part of many who fear a return to
                            instability and drifting and who hope it will succeed in laying
                            foundation for regeneration of Korea before it returns government to
                            civilian hands in spring-summer of 1963 in accordance August 12 promise
                            Chairman Pak. Very large part of population, however, remain
                            non-committal, and “wait and see” remains most characteristic attitude
                            of majority of Koreans. This attitude, almost indistinguishable from
                            skepticism, springs from traditional lack of confidence that Koreans and
                            especially those who govern Korea can be effective for long, will not
                            succumb to corruption and factionalism, or can contain their urge to
                            dominate once they are in power.</p>
                        <p>7. Too soon to say where this revolution will end. There is evidence
                            traditional propensity for factionalism is asserting itself inside
                            Supreme Council. Most serious case occurred during September and first
                            week of <pb n="524" xml:id="pg_524" facs="0560"/>October when bitter
                            internal power struggle was initiated by <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim Chong-p</persName>'il, Director <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, and some young Colonels aimed at
                            purging Generals from Hamgyong Province. But there also evidence that
                            Chairman Pak and others are determined to prevent this and internal
                            power situation has become a little more stable in last couple weeks.
                            However, long-term problem far from resolved. There are also a few signs
                            of corruption and graft again appearing in high places. Here again Pak
                            and others are determined to expose and deal with it ruthlessly. At this
                            writing cannot be said with any certainty that military government will
                            not succumb to endemic factionalism or financial scandals during two
                            years it has set for its term of office. Much will depend on Chairman
                            Pak, who is coolest head and most reliable and stable of leaders. We
                            shall better be able assess these dangers in course of next three months
                            or so.</p>
                        <p>8. Second threat to stability of government stems from possibility of
                            spiraling price inflation next year. In its determination to make
                            fundamental reforms before it returns power civilian hands, government
                            is trying to do too much too quickly. Public works to relieve
                            unemployment, farm reforms (high and stable rice prices by means of rice
                            supports, refinancing usurious loans, fertilizer subsidies), prospective
                            increases next year in pay rates of government employees and military in
                            order give these dignity and reduce temptation for graft, provision of
                            loan capital at reasonable rates to small and medium industry, and
                            step-up in capital investment in public sector are all worthy
                            objectives. But they are all being pursued simultaneously and government
                            borrowing and money in circulation have expanded rapidly with prospects
                            of further increases next year. Manufacturing and trade only gradually
                            reviving from summer low.</p>
                        <p>9. Here too there are offsetting factors so that situation not entirely
                            one-sided. Tax evasion has been curtailed, and if manufacturing and
                            trade expand, collections should be much better in future. Higher
                            interest rates on time deposits are encouraging savings. Economic cost
                            of doing business should be reduced with reduction in heavy political
                            contributions and bribes. All or nearly all government enterprises have
                            in past run with heavy losses and subsidies. Most flagrant cases being
                            reorganized and if efforts successful should cut losses substantially.
                            Improved government systems of purchasing, audit, and inventory control
                            in both civilian and military sectors promise considerable savings. High
                            level of foreign exchange reserves will enable government to import if
                            necessary to hold down price inflation. Forced saving measures under
                            consideration. Prices have remained fairly stable since May 16. Finally
                            there is growing awareness by top leaders of need for restraint in
                            government expenditures and greater selectivity in their program
                            priorities.</p>
                        <pb n="525" xml:id="pg_525" facs="0561"/>
                        <p>10. In final analysis ability control price inflation will depend on more
                            rapid revival of manufacturing and trade to meet potential demand which
                            has been created. This in turn requires government settlement with
                            illicit profiteers and tax evaders who control Korean industry and who
                            have been dragging their heels in effort obtain better terms on their
                            assessments and fines. Pak decided settlement imperative, and supported
                            proposal made by profiteers to PriMin Song to pay their assessments over
                            period of years in form of capital investment in new industries, with
                            government holding equity. This has now received <gloss target="#t_SCNR1">SCNR</gloss> approval. There is therefore chance
                            price inflation may not get out of hand. We will be in better position
                            to assess this danger in two or three months.</p>
                        <p>11. Further source of danger to stability of government is more
                            intangible and more difficult to assess. It arises from activities of
                                <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim Chong-p</persName>'il and <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>. This organization is watchdog of
                            government, has extensive organization, which also embraces military,
                            holds great power. Use of wire-tapping, informers and mail censorship
                            widespread. Practice of “taking people into custody for
                            questioning”—local euphemism for arrest without warrant—(sometimes for
                            weeks) and practice of midnight arrests and reports of strong-arm
                            methods to extract confessions, still occur with sufficient frequency to
                            maintain atmosphere of insecurity and fear. Many Koreans in public or
                            business circles have blemished records in respect to graft or bribes,
                            dealing in diverted military supplies, evading taxes, or smuggling, have
                            associations with past governments or with men under arrest or suspicion
                            which could be invoked against them. Many have reservations about this
                            government or some facets of it and have been indiscreet in expressing
                            them. All this combines to produce pervasive tension that cannot be
                            ignored in our calculations. It clearly plain in government, in active
                            military service, in and outside Embassies, and even the Supreme Council
                            members and the Cabinet.</p>
                        <p>12. Pak and Supreme Council have taken some steps to deal with this fear.
                            Announcements have been made that certain offenses committed prior to
                            the coup and persons who have not been investigated for certain
                            illegalities before certain dates will not be prosecuted. Certain
                            arrests now require warrants and high level arrests need personal
                            approval of Pak. “Habeas corpus” is still in the law and in use,
                            although it is being suspended in particular cases.</p>
                        <p>13. Despite above limitations and considerable pressure both in and out
                            of government to limit <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>'s power,
                            power of <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim Chong-p</persName>'il is still
                            great enough to represent serious unsettling element in situation, and
                            is a factor in factional fight in Supreme Council. There will be no
                            relaxation in this country until <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>'s
                            power is contained or more judiciously exercised. Pak aware that
                                <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim Chong-p</persName>'il is capable of
                            excesses arising from <pb n="526" xml:id="pg_526" facs="0562"/>his
                            exuberance for power and his inexperience, but Pak relies heavily on
                                <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim Chong-p</persName>'il to detect
                            subversion, disloyalty, dishonesty and conspiracy, and these are four
                            factors in situation which cannot be brushed away. It is our hope that
                            when present Revolutionary Court trials are finished, which is planned
                            for end of this year, atmosphere will become much less tense.</p>
                        <p>15. From United States point of view, despite above dangers, this
                            government still offers much hope. Gen <persName corresp="#p_MGGS1">Meloy</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_KJS1">Killen</persName> and
                            I are encouraged by fact we have access to top leaders and they are
                            often responsive to our private counsel and advice and sensitive to
                            United States and world opinion. They are determined to establish Korea
                            on far sounder basis in all respects and if they can deal successfully
                            with above dangers, there could be established a stable political and
                            economic environment for progress over next few years. In this event,

                        <p>1. The Chairman welcomed the Secretary to Seoul.</p>
                        <p>2. The Secretary said President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> was looking forward with pleasure to the
                            Chairman's visit,<note n="3" xml:id="d245fn3">See <ref target="#d247">Document 247</ref>.</note> and the Chairman and his colleagues
                            could be assured of a friendly welcome. The American Government was
                            greatly impressed by the military government's efforts to deal with
                            corruption, and with the energy with which it was tackling many Korean
                            problems. He knew that the American Government had made many mistakes in
                            Korea, at the same time it must be said that the performance of past
                            Korean Governments has been disappointing and unsatisfactory. The
                            military government was doing many things to establish economic,
                            political and social life on a new basis, and the Secretary wished the
                            Chairman to know that we supported these efforts.</p>
                        <p>3. The Secretary asked if there was anything the Chairman wished him to
                            convey to the President in advance of the visit. Chairman Pak said he
                            was sure General <persName corresp="#p_MGGS1">Meloy</persName>, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJS1">Killen</persName> and Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName> had made the necessary
                            reports on the situation in Korea so that he knew the President would be
                            fully informed in advance, and he had nothing to suggest.</p>
                        <p>4. The Secretary said the President would want to talk with him about the
                            dangerous world situation which exists over Berlin. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                            <pb n="528" xml:id="pg_528" facs="0564"/>was set on a course which
                            unless he changed was headed for collision. The effects could be
                            immediately felt everywhere including the Korean front. He was sure the
                            Chairman, as a military man, realized that the Korean and U.S. forces
                            must be on the alert. Moreover, it was important during this period of
                            crisis to maintain Korean military forces at their present strength. The
                            Chairman said the Korean Government had every intention of maintaining
                            its military forces at full strength.</p>
                        <p>5. The Secretary congratulated the Chairman on his promotion to full
                            General.</p>
                        <p>6. The Chairman said it was 10:00 a.m. and the Republic of Korea was
                            observing a minute of silence in protest against Soviet nuclear
                            tests.</p>
                        <p>7. Resuming, the Secretary said he had talked with Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> on the need for a
                            Korean-Japanese settlement.<note n="4" xml:id="d245fn4">A memorandum of
                                that discussion, November 2, is in Department of State, Central

                            <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> had a full appreciation both
                            of the need for and the importance of a settlement. <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName>, as the Chairman knew, had
                            domestic opposition to a settlement from the Socialists. In his talks
                            with <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName>, it was evident that he
                            realized that the Chairman also had his domestic problems. The Secretary
                            said he was pleased that the Chairman was stopping in Tokyo en route to
                            the U.S. for a long talk with <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName>. Face-to-face talks and quiet diplomacy were the
                            only way to deal with problems as emotionally loaded as this one was.
                            The Secretary said he was confident that only good could come from these
                            talks, and he hoped that a new chapter was about to be written in
                            Korean-Japanese relations. The Secretary said the U.S. Government could
                            not and should not involve itself directly as a mediator or intermediary
                            in these negotiations, but he wished to say to the Chairman that if he
                            thought we could be helpful we would be ready to do what we could.</p>
                        <p>8. The Chairman nodded approvingly while these remarks were made. The
                            Chairman said he thought the Japanese sincerely wished a settlement and
                            he hoped in his direct talks with Ikeda to establish the basis for
                            successful negotiations. He hoped that an understanding could be reached
                            soon, and thanked the Secretary for his offer to be helpful.</p>

                            Tuesday, November 14. The Secretary extended a warm welcome to Chairman
                            Park and his party, and expressed his appreciation for his reception in
                            Korea on the occasion of his recent visit there.<note n="1" xml:id="d246fn1">See <ref target="#d245">Document 245</ref>.</note>
                            He said that the United States was impressed with the Chairman's
                            accomplishments and those of his Government in Korea at present, and
                            that he looked forward to an opportunity to make the current series of
                            talks as profitable as possible for both sides.</p>
                        <p>Chairman Park said he appreciated the warm welcome he had received.
                            Referring to the ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, from which
                            he had just come, he said he had been deeply touched at this
                            recollection of American sacrifice for Korea, and appeared at the
                            conference table with deep feeling. The Secretary said he had been
                            struck by a small but significant incident at the airport: Chairman
                            Park's thoughtful greeting for the Korean community after the welcoming
                            ceremony was a simple but expressive gesture and the first such action
                            that he had observed.</p>

                            would be to review matters in a preliminary way; he would like the
                            Chairman to raise any points he might wish on his side, following which
                            the Secretary might have a few to raise for his part.</p>
                        <p>Chairman Park said that the first purpose of his visit was to convey
                            thanks for United States assistance. He wished also to take the
                            opportunity to present his views on the problems of Korea and his
                            recommendations. He believed the Secretary was already familiar with
                            most of the major problems since he had visited Korea and had been
                            briefed by the Government Ministers there; moreover, Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KJS1">Killen</persName> had reported to him in
                            Washington. In a way it was odd to reiterate this material, but he would
                            like to re-emphasize the points the Secretary already knew. The
                            Secretary replied that he would be happy to hear the Chairman's views
                            and recalled his long association with Korea.</p>
                        <p>The Chairman stated that in view of the Communist threat, Korea must
                            maintain her armed forces strength of 600,000, but at the same time
                            Korea must develop economically. These two major problems must go
                            together. The United States was aware of the decrease in force
                            maintenance assistance since 1960, with the consequent increase in the
                            Korean proportion of force maintenance. Korea was making all possible
                            efforts on its own to take over America's share of the burden, because
                            the problem affected the over-all defense posture throughout the Free
                            World. However, the Korean Government had prepared a five-year economic
                            development program. The increase in the defense budget imposed a burden
                            on economic development. Therefore, until the economy was stabilized to
                            a certain extent, he hoped the level of United States military
                            assistance would be maintained at the level of 1959 for force
                            maintenance.</p>
                        <p>The Chairman pointed out that to remain as the staunchest anti-Communist
                            country, for which an armed forces strength of 600,000 men was
                            imperative, it was necessary to obtain as much economic aid as possible
                            until the five-year program was completed. It had been reported,
                            although not verified, that supporting assistance was to be decreased.
                            If true, this fact would reflect a great deal on the economic program.
                            Accordingly, the Chairman requested that this year's level be
                            maintained.</p>
                        <pb n="531" xml:id="pg_531" facs="0567"/>
                        <p>The Chairman continued that, in order to carry out the five-year economic
                            program for the next year, Korea had planned to invite large foreign
                            investment loans. Korea was faced with a shortage of hwan to meet the
                            local currency requirements associated with such loans. It was,
                            therefore, necessary to ask for a loan of $100 million as a special, or
                            stabilization fund plus $70 million from <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss>, and technical assistance of $8 million. Of course,
                            this might seem a large request, and the Chairman recognized that the
                            United States had its own problems; but to maintain a strong
                            anti-Communist nation and 600,000 troops, Korea needed this amount of
                            United States assistance. The Chairman said he recognized that he had
                            reiterated items the Secretary had already known about, but wished
                            nonetheless to repeat them.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that he was glad to discuss the policy aspects of
                            Korea's requirements with the Chairman; there would be opportunity
                            during the visit to discuss the subject in more detail.<note n="4" xml:id="d246fn4"> Pak met with <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt

                                Secretary of Commerce Luther H. Hodges on November 15 at 2:30 p.m.
                                They discussed mutual trade and <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                                development. (Memorandum of conversation, November 15; Department of
                                State, Central Files, 795B.00/11-1561)</note> He continued that,
                            first, the American people and Government felt a strong commitment to
                            uphold the safety and independence of the Republic of Korea. This
                            feeling was not based solely upon the Mutual Defense Treaty. The United
                            States had already made a very large investment in Korea's independence
                            and security in terms of men and resources. Moreover, in the present
                            world situation, the facts of international life gave the United States
                            a powerful interest in the security of the Republic of Korea. In this
                            connection, the Secretary said that the United States had had some
                            extremely dangerous questions on its agenda this year which touched
                            closely the Sino-Soviet bloc—Berlin, Southeast Asia, the Congo, and
                            other points of immediate friction, of which the Chairman was aware. The
                            United States had not thought it wise on its side to inflame other
                            issues and points of friction, such as the Middle East, Iran, and Korea,
                            by making speeches about them. The United States had a direct and
                            fundamental commitment to Korea, but we did not think it wise to make
                            speeches on Korea vis-a-vis the communists at this time.</p>
                        <p>The Free World will go through a period of great danger in the next few
                            months. In the case of Berlin, although there had been some apparent
                            reduction of tension in one or two procedural matters, there was still
                            conflict between the powers concerned on the basic issues. Speaking to
                            the <pb n="532" xml:id="pg_532" facs="0568"/>Chairman in the most
                            private possible sense, the Secretary wished to say that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> was still on a collision
                            course in respect to Berlin. Similarly, in Southeast Asia it was
                            apparent that the Sino-Soviet bloc was engaged in a “sacred war of
                            liberation,” which the Free World would define as an illegal war of
                            enslavement. In respect to Viet-Nam, the United States would be taking
                            basic measures which would become apparent in the future. The Secretary
                            explained that he was saying this to the Chairman because it was
                            important to him even though these points were distant from Korea; it
                            was unlikely there could be tension in troubled areas without having
                            effects all around the Sino-Soviet bloc. Accordingly, the Secretary
                            said, he agreed with the Chairman that Korean and United States forces
                            in Korea should be in a good state of readiness and preparation in the
                            months ahead. The Chairman could rely completely on the presence of
                            American armed forces in Korea as tangible and, the Secretary thought,
                            convincing evidence of the United States commitment in Korea.</p>
                        <p>In respect to assistance, both military and economic, the Secretary
                            recalled that an Englishman once termed economics “the dismal science,”
                            because those on the policy side demanded more than those on the
                            resource side could furnish. This was surely true in Korea as in the
                            United States. He wished to give background on one special part of the
                            problem: The <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>
                            administration and Congress felt it necessary to review in broadest
                            terms the experience of fifteen years with United States foreign aid,
                            because it was felt that the American people had become weary of foreign
                            aid and needed a new program they could support with good conscience and
                            some degree of enthusiasm. Great emphasis had been put in the
                            administration's foreign aid program on long-term economic development
                            and support for such programs as Korea's five-year development plan.
                            Unfortunately, the Congress had taken up the idea of long-range
                            development, but at the same time had put pressure on reducing military
                            assistance, supporting assistance, and short-term assistance generally.
                            He wished to say with great sincerity and without giving offense that it
                            seemed some aid given on a short-term basis had not been used to best
                            advantage in some countries, including Korea. The same reasons which had
                            led Chairman Park and his Government to take power led the United States
                            to believe that aid had not been used to best advantage. The attitude of
                            Congress was heavily influenced by the past, and it had not been able to
                            take into account developments at the present time. Korea had problems
                            but the United States had also, such as those just stated. The United
                            States would endeavor to work out solutions realistically and speedily
                            with Chairman Park and his Government, taking account of defense needs,
                            not only in Korea but in the entire world, and of the need also for
                            economic and social development.</p>
                        <pb n="533" xml:id="pg_533" facs="0569"/>
                        <p>The Secretary continued that there were one or two points he would like
                            to make which had bearing on the question of need: first, whether there
                            were aspects of economic development where added assistance might be
                            provided by the armed forces as a part of their training operations
                            without interfering with their combat readiness—in such fields as
                            engineering, signal communications, and health. The Secretary said that
                            the Prime Minister had pointed to the limitations on armed forces
                            participation because of the unemployment problem, but he left it as
                            something to consider, based on his own armed forces experience. He
                            realized that soldiers in all countries felt it their duty to fight, not
                            to work, but he still supported the possibility. A second possibility,
                            the Secretary said, was the contribution which might result from
                            relations with Japan. He would welcome the observations which the
                            Chairman might wish to make. A third point was that, although there
                            might be legal limits on various categories of United States assistance,
                            there were “many ways to skin a cat,” and the United States would work
                            with Korea to find solutions to problems.</p>
                        <p>Chairman Park responded that, as a citizen of Korea, he wished to express
                            his deep regret that United States assistance had not always been
                            utilized to best effect. The Secretary interjected that it would be
                            better to say that there had been mistakes on both sides. The Chairman
                            continued that he also fully realized the United States, as leader of
                            the Free World, must give consideration to many countries other than
                            Korea. All came to the United States and looked to the United States for
                            assistance and support; if it continued, the United States would exhaust
                            its resources for aid. Unless they attained self-sufficiency one by one,
                            eventually Free World strength would deteriorate. He noted the Secretary
                            had pointed out that one of the reasons for the recent revolution was
                            ineffective use of United States assistance. The present revolutionary
                            government was fully aware it must strive for self-sufficiency so that
                            gradually United States aid could be decreased. Also, the Secretary had
                            pointed out the orientation of United States policy toward long-term
                            loans rather than grant assistance; however, in Korea it was impossible
                            to switch from one to the other at once. The Secretary responded that he
                            recognized Korea's problem in this regard.</p>
                        <p>However, if present United States assistance was continued for the next
                            few years, Korea would be able to lay the foundations for transition to
                            long-term loans.</p>
                        <p>The Chairman referred to questions raised by the Secretary. Regarding the
                            Secretary's suggestion on the utilization of the armed forces in
                            economic development, the Government was planning to make maximum
                            utilization of them and had already started in that direction. In his
                            opinion, it was mandatory so to use the armed forces, so long as their
                            primary duty was not imperiled.</p>

                        <p>In respect to his meeting with Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> en route to the United States, the Chairman keenly
                            felt it was necessary to normalize relations between the two countries
                            to assure peace and security for the Far East. This was the consensus of
                            himself and other Government leaders, but he could not say Korean public
                            opinion was the same as theirs. In order to satisfy public sentiment, it
                            was necessary to solve a couple of pending issues before the
                            relationship between the two countries was normalized. On this point, he
                            had had an exchange of frank views with Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> at an exclusive private interview.
                            Both men had agreed the two countries must normalize diplomatic
                            relations at the earliest opportunity. To attain this, a couple of
                            problems remained to be solved; administrative and technical details had
                            to be ironed out at working levels. This done, economic relations
                            between Korea and Japan could be taken into consideration. It was a fact
                            that some knowledgeable people in Korea expressed concern at possible
                            Japanese economic aggression if relations were normalized, especially in
                            view of past history. The Government was using all prudence in
                            normalizing relations with Japan.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he wanted to repeat what he had said to the Prime
                            Minister—that he did not expect settlement with Japan to provide a
                            substitute for United States aid, but rather a supplementary resource.
                            Though it was a matter for the experts, the Secretary felt some aspect
                            of a Korea-Japan settlement might provide a hwan contribution, perhaps
                            through some interlocking arrangement with the United States.</p>
                        <p>Chairman Park said that this matter was too technical to answer, but
                            asked the Secretary whether he could give the Korean side some hope in
                            respect to the question that he had raised. The Secretary said he would
                            rather let Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HF1">Hamilton</persName> discuss
                            these questions, and perhaps he himself could talk to the Chairman
                            before he left.<note n="5" xml:id="d246fn5">See <ref target="#d248">Document 248</ref>.</note> There would also be conversations
                            with the President. He wished to make clear that this response should
                            not be taken as a negative answer.</p>
                        <p>In concluding, the Secretary expressed his belief that the amnesty
                            measures taken by the Korean Government would contribute to the
                            international standing of Korea and stated his view that the Chairman
                            was to be congratulated on this step.</p>

                        <p>The President read the joint communique and said it appeared satisfactory
                            to him. If it were equally so to Chairman Park, he thought they could go
                            ahead and issue it.<note n="1" xml:id="d247fn1">The communique, which
                                was negotiated in advance of Pak's visit, is in <hi rend="italic">American</hi>

                            directed that it be issued.</p>
                        <p>The President mentioned that he and the Chairman had discussed at lunch
                            in considerable detail the matter of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>-Japan relations. Also, with the Foreign Minister he had
                            discussed the situation in Viet-Nam. The Foreign Minister had promised
                            to give him a memorandum of what, in his judgment, might be useful to us
                            to do in that difficult crisis. The President spoke of our great concern
                            over how to prevent the collapse of <pb n="536" xml:id="pg_536" facs="0572"/>Viet-Nam. The ultimate step was the use of U.S. troops.
                            However, the real answer was for the Vietnamese to do for themselves and
                            not rely heavily on help from abroad. The President said that Viet-Nam
                            was a common problem, not just a U.S. one, and he wondered whether the
                            Chairman might have some ideas on this score.</p>
                        <p>Chairman Park began by expressing his appreciation for the time the
                            President was able to give him and also for U.S. support for Korea in
                            these difficult days. As he had said to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HF1">Hamilton</persName> earlier, he realized the heavy burden the U.S.
                            was bearing and he felt that each nation of the Free World must do its
                            best to decrease this burden by its own efforts, thereby increasing the
                            strength of the Free World. This was the reason why he laid such stress
                            on the ROK-Japan settlement.</p>
                        <p>With regard to Southeast Asia, particularly Viet-Nam, the Chairman stated
                            that, as a firm anti-Communist nation, Korea would do its best to
                            contribute to the security of the Far East. North Viet-Nam had
                            well-trained guerrilla forces. Korea had a million men well trained in
                            this type of warfare. These men had been trained in the regular forces
                            and were now separated. With U.S. approval and support, Korea could send
                            to Viet-Nam its own troops or could recruit volunteers if regular troops
                            were not desired. Such action would prove that there was unity of action
                            among the nations of the Free World. Just before departure he had
                            discussed this question with his senior <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> officers. All were enthusiastic. He suggested that the
                            President ask his military advisers to study this offer and let him know
                            the results.</p>
                        <p>The President expressed deep appreciation, noting that the U.S. was
                            carrying the burden from Berlin all the way around the globe. He would
                            talk with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and
                            the Chairman might have some more detailed discussions with him and
                            General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> tomorrow. The
                            President speculated that it would probably be a good idea to talk also
                            with the Filipinos. There was a limit, as the French found out, on what
                            an occidental could do in a situation like this.</p>
                        <p>Turning to economic matters, the President spoke of his regret at having
                            to institute the “Buy American” policy, which limited the effectiveness
                            of our aid by closing cheaper supply sources to us. He then outlined in
                            some detail for Chairman Park the Congressional alarm over the flight of
                            gold and the alternative posed by the Congress, i.e., either it would
                            drastically cut aid appropriations or the Administration must limit
                            where the funds would be spent. The President had chosen the latter
                            course, but he hoped in a couple of years the situation would be
                            corrected, and, when this occurred, the first step would be a reversal
                            of “Buy American.” Chairman Park appreciated this explanation and said
                            that he was not asking revocation of the whole policy, only certain
                            specific exceptions important to Korea. The President went into some
                            further <pb n="537" xml:id="pg_537" facs="0573"/>details on the U.S.
                            payments difficulties and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> suggested that the Korean waiver request might be
                            pursued at dinner that night.</p>
                        <p>Chairman Park said that he had brought some documents with him concerning
                            the events before and after the May revolution and what had been
                            accomplished. He had discussed this matter with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HF1">Hamilton</persName>. The President said both Ambassadors had
                            presented to him very convincing stories of the accomplishments of the
                            revolutionary group. He had been impressed and assured the Chairman the
                            U.S. would give him the maximum support possible. He drew attention to
                            the fact that we had had to spend a great deal more money in Southeast
                            Asia (Laos and Viet-Nam) than originally planned. However, we knew the
                            importance of aid to Korea; if Korea were not free, Japan would not be
                            free and that would mean the whole Pacific area would go too, so Korea
                            had a vital interest for us. In this connection, the President thought
                            it would interest Chairman Park if Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> gave him an assessment of
                            U.S. military strength in light of the recent Soviet atmospheric
                            testing.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> described how
                            the U.S. military budget had been increased by $6 billion over the
                            previous administration's planning figure primarily to increase nuclear
                            military power, and non-nuclear strength such as ground and air support
                            forces. Of our 1700 total nuclear-equipped bomber strength, 850 could be
                            in the air in 15 minutes. The Polaris and Minuteman missile programs had
                            been increased by 50 percent. 300,000 men had been added, mostly to the
                            ground forces. A billion and a half dollars had gone into increased
                            logistic capabilities. In sum, our over-all military strength was
                            greater than that of the Communist Bloc and the President had instructed
                            him to keep it that way. With regard to nuclear strength, the U.S. was
                            substantially superior to the Soviets despite their recent test series.
                            We were three to eight times better off quantitatively and far ahead
                            quality-wise. The Soviets, for example, could only place 200 to 300
                            nuclear bombers over North America at present. As for <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>, the Secretary noted that we now had
                            5 Polaris submarines carrying 80 nuclear missiles.</p>
                        <p>The President said we were faced with the challenge of maintaining our
                            strategic position and being prepared to fight guerrilla wars—“wars of
                            liberation,” as <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> called
                            them in stating the Soviets would back these types of wars. However, the
                            President said, he was confident we could deliver, even after an initial
                            Soviet attack, a more crippling blow to the Soviets than they had
                            originally launched against us. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> repeated this, because he said he wanted it
                            absolutely certain that Chairman Park and his party understood what the
                            President had just said.</p>
                        <p>The President said our most difficult task right now was the other kind
                            of struggle, such as that going on in Iran, Viet-Nam and Cuba. Secretary
                                <pb n="538" xml:id="pg_538" facs="0574"/>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> asked Chairman Park if there
                            were Communist infiltration across the 38th parallel. The Chairman
                            replied that there was none now across the parallel. They had tried by
                            every means to infiltrate but they had been rooted out. The President
                            invited the Chairman to give his estimate of the state of morale and
                            political orientation of the North Koreans. The Chairman replied that
                            their daily food consumption was low and civilian living standards very
                            poor. They were, of course, superior in basic industries and mineral
                            resources to South Korea. Likewise, their electric power output was now
                            1,100,000 k.w. whereas the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> goal in
                            their 5-year plan was only 1,030,000. The President asked about the
                            possibility of atomic generation of electric power in Korea. The
                            Chairman replied that construction costs were so high they had given it
                            no thought, but (smiling) if U.S. support were forthcoming, they would
                            certainly consider it. North and South Korean ground forces and navy
                            were about even in potential, according to Chairman Park, but in air
                            power the Communists were 4 times as strong. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> asked whether this was strictly
                            North Korean air power or ChiCom and Soviet air power. The Chairman said
                            it was strictly North Korean; however, the U.S. air forces in Korea and
                            Japan equalized the situation.</p>
                        <p>North Korea was putting great emphasis on industrialization and South
                            Korea was in danger of falling far behind. His most urgent task was to
                            maintain his armed strength and at the same time to build up the
                            economy. He compared the situation in Korea today to Germany, saying
                            that in a divided country, unless each side maintained economic strength
                            equal to the other, one side would fall far behind in many respects. The
                            Chairman did not want South Korea caught this way and his primary
                            objective in coming here was to seek the President's positive support
                            for the maintenance of the Korean armed forces at their present strength
                            and also for the implementation of economic reforms and regeneration.
                            The Chairman inquired whether the words of the communique meant that
                            that support would be forthcoming. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> reassured the Chairman that we recognized the
                            importance of maintaining armed strength throughout the Free World and
                            at the same time generating economic, social progress. Our experts would
                            work with his and the Secretary felt sure we could move forward with
                            confidence together.</p>
                        <p>The President said he wanted no misunderstanding between himself and the
                            Chairman. As he had already indicated, he considered the safety and
                            security of Korea vital to the U.S. We would do the very best we could
                            but the Chairman must realize that we had not been too successful in the
                            aid appropriations this year and he wanted the Chairman to have a very
                            clear idea of our problems and responsibilities and why we cannot do as
                            much as we would like. The Chairman said that he wished to reiterate his
                            conviction that it was most important that the developing nations of the
                            Free World be able to stand on their own feet. <pb n="539" xml:id="pg_539" facs="0575"/>He felt the emphasis should be on those
                            nations that could accomplish the most in the shortest time. The
                            President said that we shared that thought. Our Congress and people felt
                            most strongly that aid should go where it would do the most good. Laos
                            had been most distressing because we had put a lot of aid in there that
                            seemed to have gone down the drain. One of our disappointments had been
                            that the economically sound European nations had not assumed more of the
                            aid burden. They were ready to make loans, but at 6 percent or higher.
                            The President added that, as far as Berlin was concerned, he could give
                            no assurances of successful negotiations, so that we might be faced with
                            a serious problem of access to the city after the peace treaty had been
                            signed. In fact, we might be hard pressed in Berlin and Viet-Nam at the
                            same time.</p>
                        <p>The Chairman said he thought he had taken enough of the President's time
                            and wanted to say good-bye, but could he have before leaving a
                            “refreshing answer” to his request for support? The President replied
                            that we would far rather do what we said we would, rather than say
                            something we could not fulfill. As a matter of fact, he had wished
                            someone would give him something refreshing, and he had been refreshed
                            by the Chairman's offer of help in Viet-Nam. The President said that
                            perhaps he had given the Chairman some encouragement by telling him we
                            had enough atom bombs to blow us all up. Seriously, he did not want the
                            Chairman to leave with a feeling of not having achieved what he had come
                            here for, but he was sure the Chairman realized now the grave problems
                            facing us. The President hoped that Ambassador Chung would be able to
                            elaborate on these for the Chairman.<note n="2" xml:id="d247fn2">President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> met Pak

                        <p>The Secretary began by saying that, while he would have the privilege of
                            bidding the Chairman good-bye at the airport the next day, he wanted to
                            have a few minutes conversation with him, as he had mentioned at their
                            first meeting on November 14. The Secretary said he also wanted to take
                            advantage of the opportunity to congratulate the Chairman on his
                            appearance at the National Press Club, which he understood had gone off
                            extremely well. The Chairman thanked the Secretary and said he thought
                            the Press Club meeting had been all right.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary want on to say that he had reviewed the discussions the
                            Chairman had had with the President, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, himself, and others, and he
                            hoped the Chairman understood that he could go back with full confidence
                            of U.S. determination to do what the President said we would. There was
                            one particular point he wished to mention and that was he had gained the
                            impression that the figure of $90 million Supporting Assistance had
                            perhaps assumed more importance during the visit than it deserved. He
                            felt he had sensed some disappointment regarding this figure among the
                            Chairman's colleagues. He himself had discussed with the Chairman the
                            difficulties we encountered in dealing with so many different countries
                            and endeavoring to meet their needs for varying types of aid such as
                            supporting assistance, technical cooperation, development loans,
                            etc.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he was concerned that, if a member of the
                            Chairman's party on his return should speak of the $90 million in terms
                            of disappointment, it would be harmful to public understanding on both
                                <pb n="541" xml:id="pg_541" facs="0577"/>sides, since this figure
                            might not be related to the total amount of aid received. For example,
                            regular military assistance committed to Korea would be very
                            substantial, even though, for policy reasons, there was never any public
                            announcement of the total figure. Likewise, there were the development
                            loans whose purpose was to initiate and sustain specifically the kind of
                            economic development the Chairman had spoken of during his stay. The
                            Secretary said that he had the impression that a given amount of
                            assistance to Korea would now produce more results than the same amount
                            given to previous governments. In other words, a dollar in the
                            Chairman's hand was worth more than in the hands of previous
                            governments, but the Chairman must have the profit and not the U.S.
                            Specifically in regard to the questions of offshore procurement and “Buy
                            American” policy, the Secretary reiterated our determination to do our
                            best to make adjustments favorable to Korea.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary emphasized that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName> had the full backing of the President and the
                            other interested Department heads as well as a full understanding of the
                            significance of the President's assurances to the Chairman of our
                            determination to assist the Republic of Korea and his Government to
                            progress in accordance with the Chairman's plans. The Chairman's visit
                            and the opportunity it had afforded the top echelon of our Government of
                            becoming personally acquainted with the Chairman and his colleagues had
                            given us a deep sense of assurance. He hoped the Chairman would go back
                            with a deeper assurance on his side of our interest and determination to
                            assist him and his country. Finally, the Secretary remarked that he had
                            been privileged to receive a number of foreign guests, but it was his
                            opinion that no other visitor had more right to return to his country
                            with confidence. The Secretary had lived through a good part of the
                            recent history of Korea, and he wanted the opportunity to say this
                            simply and directly to the Chairman.</p>
                        <p>Chairman Park said he fully appreciated and understood the Secretary's
                            remarks and was grateful for the hospitality extended to him. He had
                            been deeply impressed and encouraged by the assurances of friendship and
                            help which had been conveyed to him. He took pride in sharing the
                            responsibility of meeting the great tasks ahead. He also wished to thank
                            the Secretary for coming to see him with the message that he had just
                            given him. He agreed that if the $90 million figure was singled out it
                            might become some sort of symbol, but it would not represent the truth
                            of the deep relations between the two countries. It would, therefore,
                            perhaps be better to forget the figure in terms of trying to measure
                            U.S. interest in Korea.</p>
                        <p>In closing the meeting, the Secretary said the Chairman was very strongly
                            represented in Washington, not only by Ambassador Chung but by
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName> as well.</p>

                        <p>DEAR <persName corresp="#p_DSP1">DEAN</persName>: I have now had time to
                            reflect on the situation here in the light of Park Chung Hee's visit to
                            the United States, and am able to send you the appraisal you
                                requested.<note n="1" xml:id="d249fn1">
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s request has not been
                                found.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. I believe the political situation is now fairly well stabilized, and
                            we can count on this continuing for at least six months. I would not yet
                            venture to say it will remain stable until the election promised for May
                            1963 because there are still some uncertainties, especially in the
                            economic field, but I think it possible. (All this presupposes that Park
                            will escape an assassin's bullet.)</p>
                        <p>3. I attribute this stabilization to five principal factors:</p>
                        <p>a. When the Junta took power in May almost no one knew who they were or
                            what they were up to. They have now established themselves as a group of
                            capable, energetic and dedicated men, determined to make genuine
                            reforms, to lay foundations for honest and effective government, and
                            devoted to the return of representative government. They have produced
                            convincing evidence that they will not tolerate corruption, graft,
                            bribes, smuggling, tax evasion, or political blackmail in government,
                            military or civilian life. They are introducing long overdue reforms in
                            agriculture, industry, banking, education, and social welfare. They are
                            reorganizing public administration at all levels. While there is
                            skepticism in some quarters that they will succeed, bitterness on the
                            part of those who have been hurt, and criticism that in some respects
                            they have moved too fast and often too arbitrarily, no honest person
                            here now questions their motives, and most people are impressed with
                            their dedication and an increasing number with the results already
                            achieved.</p>
                        <p>b. The emergency stage of the revolution is now practically over, and the
                            early atmosphere of tension and personal fear and insecurity has
                            virtually disappeared. People are now beginning to relax and speak more
                            freely, and the press, while still inhibited by self-censorship, puts
                            out a surprising amount of critical comment. There are two main reasons
                            for this improved atmosphere:</p>
                        <p>i. The government has announced there will be no further indictments
                            after December 11 before the Special Revolutionary Courts, which hope to
                            wind up their trials of those indicted prior to that date by February
                                <pb n="543" xml:id="pg_543" facs="0579"/>or earlier, and people who
                            have not been charged for past offenses can now breathe easy.</p>
                        <p>ii. The government policy of amnesty or leniency toward all but principal
                            offenders—in the interests of national unity—has been greeted with
                            relief.</p>
                        <p>However, even though arrests from now on will normally require warrants,
                            habeas corpus will be restored, and future trials will generally take
                            place in the regular courts, the government is not yet ready to restore
                            full “due process.” The right of peaceful assembly is still restricted
                            by martial law; the midnight to 4 a.m. curfew is still in effect; and
                            under a special law which went into effect December 11 persons who
                            obstruct revolutionary tasks, initiate disturbance or civil war, or join
                            anti-state organizations will be subject to court-martial. These may be
                            subject to arrest without warrant and may not be protected by habeas
                            corpus. Sentences for such activities may be as severe as death.</p>
                        <p>c. Chairman Park Chung Hee has established himself in Republic minds as a
                            forceful, fair and intelligent leader who can be trusted with power,
                            trusted to keep the revolution on the path of decency and moderation,
                            and trusted to abide by the pledge he gave on August 12 to return to
                            civilian government after the election in May 1963. Park, therefore,
                            represents a most important link between the government and the people,
                            and a most important stabilizing element in the situation. Moreover, the
                            vigor with which Park has fought against factionalism in the Supreme
                            Council has so far served to keep this endemic disease under
                            control.</p>
                        <p>d. The bumper 1961 crop, the gradually accelerating economic revival
                            since July, public works to help relieve unemployment, and the
                            government's farm reform measures are beginning to give new hope to the
                            people. Earlier fears of inflation have somewhat subsided; civil
                            servants, teachers and soldiers are looking forward to a promised pay
                            increase in 1962; and the farmers, after an initial skepticism, are
                            beginning to believe that perhaps this government is different from its
                            predecessors and that there will be real reforms to the benefit of
                            agriculture.</p>
                        <p>e. The public support given the military government by the United States
                            and the friendly reception of Park during his visit to the United States
                            have, however, been perhaps the decisive factors in stabilizing the
                            situation. One Korean put it to me in a sentence, “Since the United
                            States is impressed with Park, we Koreans value him more.”</p>
                        <p>4. As a result of the above any immediate danger of an attempted counter
                            coup has receded; the government is growing every day in
                            self-confidence; false rumors about corruption and incompetence in
                            government, directed partly at American ears, have almost ceased
                            circulating; and the threat that the government would be torn to pieces
                            by factionalism has subsided.</p>
                        <pb n="544" xml:id="pg_544" facs="0580"/>
                        <p>5. Thus, as I see it, we shall enter 1962 with fairly promising
                            prospects:</p>
                        <p>a. Our economic aid and loan and military assistance programs for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1962 will be more effectively used than
                            by any previous government and should provide enough to produce
                            substantial economic progress next year. There is the prospect that the
                            International Development Association may soon make its first loan to
                            Korea—for railway rolling stock. The West German government has just
                            announced that $37 million in government and private funds will be made
                            available for capital investment. If there is a settlement with Japan in
                            the current negotiations—and the military government is determined to
                            achieve this and is prepared to make reasonable concessions—this will
                            bring great benefits to the Korean community and give them even more
                            hope for their future. Indeed without a normalization of Korean-Japanese
                            relations, I can see little hope for the economic future of South
                            Korea.</p>
                        <p>b. The United States Operations Mission, under Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KJS1">Killen</persName>'s able direction, is being
                            rapidly whipped into shape, both in terms of policies and staff, so as
                            to concentrate our aid and our energies in the vital sectors. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJS1">Killen</persName> will also reduce his
                            staff by September 1, 1962, from about 475 direct hire and contract
                            employees to about 225. If more US economic aid and loans can be
                            effectively utilized, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KJS1">Killen</persName>
                            and I will not hesitate to ask for them.</p>
                        <p>c. Our United States military are encouraged by the vigor with which the
                            government is eliminating corrupt practices in the military and reducing
                            the volume of pilfering and diversion of military supplies. Improvements
                            in auditing, inspection and inventory control in the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> military establishment are also
                            producing good results, and many of these practices are now being
                            introduced in the civilian government sector.</p>
                        <p>6. Against this rosy background there are, however, certain potential
                            dangers in the situation:</p>
                        <p>a. The government is trying to do too much too fast, as a result of which
                            its calendar 1962 budget, now under consideration, is not only very much
                            larger than last year but provides for an excessive amount of deficit
                            financing. It is quite clear they are assuming the United States will
                            make up most of this deficit. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KJS1">Killen</persName> and I are doing everything possible to persuade
                            them to reduce their planned expenditures. We are making clear that we
                            will take no responsibility for making up any such deficit as they have
                            budgeted for nor bail them out if unwise policies set off a serious
                            price inflation. We are asking them to come up with a more prudent and
                            better balanced budget at this stage, and to resort to supplemental
                            budgets if the situation develops more favorably than we now think. At
                            this writing I cannot tell you what success we will have.</p>
                        <pb n="545" xml:id="pg_545" facs="0581"/>
                        <p>b. Since the low point of economic activity in June when only $7.4
                            million of foreign exchange were sold, there has been an encouraging
                            improvement:</p>
                        <p>July—$10 million</p>
                        <p>August—$12.6 million</p>
                        <p>September—$21.3 million</p>
                        <p>October— $27.6 million</p>
                        <p>November—$32.9 million</p>
                        <p>Part of this rise is healthy, but part can be attributed to forward
                            speculative buying in anticipation of price inflation, for the revival
                            of production and trade has lagged behind foreign exchange sales. This
                            forward buying, of course, has the advantage of bringing goods into the
                            pipeline—now somewhat depleted as a result of the summer slump in
                            foreign exchange sales—and will serve to moderate the upward price
                            movement that it anticipates. Happily, foreign exchange reserves have
                            been climbing, and this provides a potential weapon against inflationary
                            pressures. To keep prices from spiralling in 1963, however, there will
                            need to be a much faster pickup in production. It is not yet possible to
                            say whether this will take place.</p>
                        <p>c. The Korean Business Community is still lukewarm, at best, in its
                            support of the military government and its economic program. Among the
                            pending problems assumed by the new government was a group of old cases
                            of tax evasion, profiteering by illicit means and related offenses
                            involving most of the country's leading industrialists. This posed a
                            real dilemma, since the offenses were so flagrant and well-known that
                            they could not be allowed to go unpunished, yet the people and
                            corporations concerned represented a very substantial portion of the
                            industrial plant and experience essential to economic recovery and
                            expansion. The government moved rapidly and forcefully to dispose of the
                            problem and acted with moderation and understanding of the economic as
                            well as the political issues which it entailed. The businessmen,
                            however, after their initial fright, have realized the strength of their
                            own bargaining position and have been jockeying for advantage,
                            protesting their support for the government's program but delaying the
                            action and decisions that would start wheels turning. Success in dealing
                            with this problem will require just the right combination of incentives
                            and pressure and this combination has not yet been worked out.</p>
                        <p>d. Unemployment, underemployment, and low wages are still pervasive, and
                            we are beginning to get a few reports of restlessness among urban
                            workers. So far this has been held in check by stable prices, but if
                            price inflation should get its head, there could be public
                            demonstrations and strikes next year.</p>

                        <p>e. Factionalism, which has plagued Korean governments for hundreds of
                            years, remains a latent threat to the stability of the government. That
                            factionalism has been kept under control up to now is due largely to
                            Park's determination to fight those of his colleagues who are so
                            motivated. He has been successful so far, and at the moment the
                            situation is fairly quiet, but there may well be a renewal of factional
                            fighting in the Supreme Council and it cannot yet be said with any
                            certainty that Park will be able to contain it during the whole period
                            of his government's tenure in power.</p>
                        <p>f. Corruption, the other endemic disease of Korean governments, has been
                            sharply curtailed, but there have already been a few confirmed cases of
                            corruption involving military officers in the government, including some
                            very close to those at the top. These have been immediately and severely
                            dealt with, and Park hopes this will be a warning to others. There is
                            good evidence that the great majority of leaders on the Supreme Council
                            will not hesitate to punish any offender no matter how high. While
                            leaders at the top are likely to keep their hands clean, the danger is
                            that corruption will gradually begin to creep back in the lower military
                            ranks of the Junta and among civil servants. The extent is not likely to
                            be anything like as great as in the past, because people are being very
                            much more careful. The outlook, therefore, is for less corruption, but
                            those who engage in it will play for bigger stakes. Fewer but bigger
                            scandals are therefore a possibility and could do damage to the good
                            reputation of the government.</p>
                        <p>g. The educational community is in turmoil because of a radical
                            educational reform that provides for a reduction in university and
                            college intake from about 40,000 to 11,000 a year so as to reduce the
                            total enrollment over four years from about 156,000 to about 44,000.
                            There are a number of other educational measures, including the
                            compulsory retirement of teachers and professors at 60, the organization
                            of teachers and students into associations under government auspices,
                            reduction in liberal art and expansion of technical education,
                            engineering and science enrollment, scholarships for poor students (this
                            for the first time), et cetera. These measures, some still tentative,
                            have been applauded in some circles, but they have also engendered
                            bitterness, criticism, and some resistance among those who have been
                            hurt. There is general agreement among most Koreans that reforms are
                            needed to get at profit-making “diploma mills,” bribery to get into and
                            out of universities and inferior teaching, but in developing its
                            programs the Ministry of Education has done too little spadework with
                            those interested or affected, and in general has been pre-emptory in
                            putting through its measures. There have already been two public protest
                            meetings among university groups in violation of the government ban on
                            meetings, and these have led to threats of prosecution, and there could
                            be trouble from this quarter. The <pb n="547" xml:id="pg_547" facs="0583"/>government is aware of this, is keeping the educational
                            community under close surveillance, and is determined to act forcibly to
                            break up any disturbance.</p>
                        <p>h. The government requirement that all voluntary organizations be
                            investigated and cleaned up before they will be re-registered and
                            allowed to function normally is still in effect. Trade unions, business
                            and professional associations, charity, welfare, sports, and numerous
                            other organizations are all involved. Many have already been cleared and
                            are functioning normally, although subject to irksome surveillance.
                            However, a good many organizations, still awaiting clearance, are
                            operating in low gear. Dissatisfaction hits many groups and individuals,
                            and here too, unless the situation is rectified this could become a
                            breeding ground for trouble.</p>
                        <p>I have discussed this situation with a number of leaders of these
                            organizations. With few exceptions they applaud the government's efforts
                            at reform and would support the government if given a chance. I have
                            urged key government leaders to try to enlist their positive cooperation
                            by consultation and by giving them more freedom of action, but while I
                            have been thanked for this counsel and been assured it will be done, the
                            government, and especially the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, remains suspicious and fearful of
                            organized groups, and improvement in the situation has been slow.</p>
                        <p>i. Political parties are banned, and unless government policy is changed
                            they will not be allowed to become active until January 1963. However,
                            politicians are meeting more or less secretly to plan their tactics and
                            strategy. Most of them are waiting to see how the situation develops
                            over the next six months. If it develops unfavorably they will continue
                            to sit in the wings. If it develops favorably, many of them plan to
                            offer their support and services to the government, hoping in such an
                            alliance to get into the public eye in advance of January 1963 so as to
                            pre-sent themselves as the leaders best able to carry on with the
                            revolutionary reforms when the military government retires. We may
                            assume that there are a number of military leaders who are toying with
                            the idea of taking off their uniforms and running for office, and that
                            they will not be averse to alliances with selected politicians whose
                            reputations are not too tarnished. Factionalism in the Supreme Council
                            could be enhanced by this development, because military leaders with
                            political ambitions will be jockeying for position and may differ on
                            which politicians and political groupings to join up with.</p>
                        <p>7. To summarize, I think there are good prospects for 1962, as well as
                            dangers. We shall know a lot more in the course of the next three to six
                            months. Meanwhile I think it safe to say that despite certain important
                            shortcomings and certain dangers, the record of reform and improvement
                            which has taken place is heartening and suggests we can go to Congress
                                <pb n="548" xml:id="pg_548" facs="0584"/>this spring in good
                            conscience that this has been a constructive year and that our
                            continuing massive support is well justified.</p>
                        <p>8. There are certain aspects of American aid policy based on world wide
                            considerations and which do not take into account certain special
                            problems in Korea, which are disturbing General <persName corresp="#p_MGGS1">Meloy</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KJS1">Killen</persName> and me, for they hamstring what we are trying to
                            achieve here. I have already analyzed them in Embassy telegram No. 642
                            of October 28,<note n="2" xml:id="d249fn2">See <ref target="#d244fn3">footnote 3, Document 244</ref>.</note> and there is no point in
                            going over the ground again. I mean, however, to write you about these
                            when we can see more clearly the shape of the Korean budget, now under
                            consideration.</p>

                            country team view last spring that 173 should go to the defense budget
                            and 102 to the rest. The <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> military is
                            very unhappy with <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName>'s

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName> feels that we must give
                            greater emphasis to economic development. He thinks that the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> has padded its defense budget and that
                            in any case if we keep financing some 95 per cent of it through US
                            generated local currency, we will never get the Koreans to put their own
                            house in order. He says we're facing a <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> squeeze play and must be prepared for a <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> threat to cut its forces unless we give
                            it relief.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MGGS1">Meloy</persName> argues that present

                            it was “developed by the US Joint Chiefs of Staff and approved by the

                            National Security Council.” To him, 180 billion hwan in defense budget
                            support is “vital” to Korea.</p>
                        <p>This issue is giving <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName> a
                            liberal education. He has discovered that the old five-year plan for MAP
                            gives defense such a high priority that by 1965 almost all US-controlled
                            hwan would be going into the military budget, leaving nothing for
                            support of economic growth. The only trouble is that even Berger seems
                            horrified by the thought that ROKs might cut their forces if they can't
                            get what they and <persName corresp="#p_MGGS1">Meloy</persName> want.
                            For my money, we should welcome such a <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> decision; it would begin the turn-around the Steering

                        <p>On January 18, 1962, the National Security Council, with President
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> presiding, discussed
                            the report of the Military Assistance Steering Group. The Steering Group
                            was established on July 8, 1961, by Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> to reshape the U.S. military
                            aid program. It its report, the Steering Group focused on six key U.S.
                            allies: Korea, the Republic of China, Pakistan, Iran, Greece, and
                            Turkey, which absorbed about 50 percent of the U.S. Military Assistance
                            Program. According to the report, the bulk of this aid went to equip and
                            maintain large armed forces well beyond the abilities of these
                            developing countries to maintain. At his 496th meeting the National
                            Security Council noted the President's request for further prompt
                            reviews of military and economic aspects of long-range U.S. military aid
                            planning with the assumptions that resources would be limited and that
                            military assistance programs and economic aid programs were competitive
                            as well as complementary. The President specifically asked the Joint
                            Chiefs of Staff to look again at the issue, bearing in mind that
                            decreases in military aid would be compensated by increases in economic
                            aid.</p>
                        <p>The National Security Council agreed that for Korea—as for Iran, Greece,
                            and Turkey—proposed Military Assistance Plans for fiscal years
                            1964-1968, as well as a final proposed plan for fiscal year 1963, should
                            be submitted by July 15. It required similar plans for the Agency for
                            International Development's programs for the comparable periods. For
                            Korea the Council required military and political studies in order to
                            recommend a desirable Korean force level and structure, including a
                            desirable level of U.S. forces in Korea, by June 15.</p>
                        <p>The Administrator of the Agency for International Development was
                            responsible for these studies and for determining by May 15 how to
                            improve planning and programming techniques so that military and
                            economic aid could be effectively coordinated to ensure that the total
                            aid given to a recipient country was used to best overall advantage.

                            representatives in Korea, can influence to some extent future actions.

                            fortunate in having in this Asian country a group dedicated to personal
                            integrity and opposed to corruption as well as strongly anti-Communist,
                            though the road to satisfactory democracy may be a bit rough. Therefore,
                            recommend we do not change for the present our aid policies on account
                            of this latest political action. Ambassador Berger should, however, be

                            concurrently, an increase in assistance for a comprehensive and balanced

                            Korea during the period of this estimate will probably be characterized
                            by vigorous dissension and factionalism in both military and civilian
                            circles. We believe that the military will continue to dominate the

                            government may be ostensibly civilian. Occasional abrupt changes of
                            leadership by coup d'etat may be in prospect. (Paras. 9-13)</p>
                        <p>2. The economic outlook is grim but not hopeless. Assuming a continuance
                            of US aid at approximately present levels and a reasonable degree of
                            political stability, there will probably be some improvement. An
                            increase in the amount of US aid, if effectively used, could speed up
                            the rate of economic growth and in the long run would probably
                            contribute to political and social stability. At best, however, economic
                            advance will be slow. (Paras. 14-17, 27-29)</p>
                        <p>3. The Communist powers will continue their attempts to destroy the
                            independence of South Korea by various forms of political warfare and
                            subversion. The greatest threat to the country lies in the possibility
                            that political dissension, economic stagnation, and social unrest will
                            render it increasingly vulnerable to this Communist effort. (Paras.
                            21-23)</p>
                        <p>4. As long as the Communist powers believe that the US will defend South
                            Korea, they will almost certainly not launch an overt military
                                invasion.<note n="2" xml:id="d253fn2">The Assistant Chief of Staff,
                                Intelligence, <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss>, would state
                                this sentence as follows: As long as the Communist powers believe
                                that the US will defend South Korea with the kind and degree of
                                force necessary quickly to defeat any invasion, they will almost
                                certainly not launch an overt military invasion. [Footnote in the
                                source text.]</note> Accordingly, a reduction of strength of the
                            South Korean armed forces, by anything up to about one-third of present
                            numbers, would probably not in itself increase the likelihood of
                            invasion from the north. It would, however, produce considerable
                            political unrest within the country, which would possibly be great
                            enough to endanger any government initiating the measure.<note n="3" xml:id="d253fn3">For the positions of the Director, Defense

                        <p>1. Reference is made to your memoranda of 26 January 1962 and 30 January
                            1962 to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Assistant
                            Secretary of Defense (<gloss target="#t_ISA1">ISA</gloss>),
                            respectively, concerning certain studies to be made on Korea.<note n="1" xml:id="d254fn1">The January 26 memorandum to the Chairman of the
                                    <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> has not been found; the

                        </p>
                        <p>2. In response to the above, the Joint Chiefs of Staff have conducted a
                            study of Korea from a military standpoint. This study is appended
                                hereto<note n="2" xml:id="d254fn2">The appended paper, not printed,
                                is 53 pages long.</note> and includes an assessment of the communist
                            military threat to the Republic of Korea (<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>), roles and missions of both US and <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces together with the necessary
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> force levels and equipment over
                            the period extending approximately to 1970.</p>
                        <p>3. The Joint Chiefs of Staff have re-examined the present threat; have
                            scrutinized the relationships between the military posture in Korea and
                            the threat to Korea and Northeast Asia; have noted the relationship of
                            actions in Northeast Asia to those in Southeast Asia; have challenged
                            and redetermined the minimum acceptable US/<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> military strength and structure; have re-examined the
                            precarious balance in which the new <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            military/politico/economic structure still finds itself in this first
                            year in power and have projected all of these considerations through
                            1970.</p>
                        <p>4. The Joint Chiefs of Staff consider that the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> is an essential element of our forward defense strategy
                            in Northeast Asia. A reduction in <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            forces could encourage the very aggression we seek to deter. The net
                            result of any significant reduction of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces below their present levels would be increased
                            military risk in Northeast Asia; lowering of US influence in Asia;
                            decreasing the capability of keeping a limited war at a nonnuclear
                            level; increasing the requirement for the augmentation of US forces and
                            shortening the time by which these forces must be available; and
                            encouragement of the communists to undertake further aggression.</p>
                        <p>5. In view of the above, the Joint Chiefs of Staff agree that a reduction
                            in <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> military strength by lowering
                            Military Assistance would be <pb n="555" xml:id="pg_555" facs="0591"/>directly and fundamentally counter to the US interests in Korea and
                            Northeast Asia. It cannot be emphasized too strongly that current
                                US/<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> force levels in Korea are the
                            minimum acceptable for assuring the long-term security of Northeast
                            Asia.</p>

                        <p>An expression of your concern over the apparent new impasse in the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>/Japanese negotiations would be highly
                            desirable at this point.</p>
                        <p>These talks have dragged on fitfully since 1951. <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> animosity stemming from thirty-five years of Japanese
                            rule in Korea was long the chief obstacle; <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> claims were ridiculously high. The new <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> military regime, however, is interested
                            in an early settlement because General Pak needs money for his ambitious
                            development program. But his effort, sparked by his talks with <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> last November, has now run into
                            Japanese stalling.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> has been fighting a balance
                            of payments problem brought on partly by his own ten-year development
                            plan. He foresees little relief before November and hesitates to arouse
                            public criticism by new foreign obligations. He also faces upper house
                            elections and wants reelection as Liberal Democratic Party chief this
                            summer. Leftist opponents are looking for an issue with which to
                            embarrass <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName>. Moreover,
                                <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName>'s recognition of the
                            need to stabilize the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> political and
                            economic situation is still not strong enough to overcome his suspicion
                            that the US may be <pb n="556" xml:id="pg_556" facs="0592"/>gradually
                            withdrawing support for South Korea in the expectation that Japan will
                            assume responsibility. <persName corresp="#p_REO1">Reischauer</persName>
                            says it may be late autumn before Tokyo is willing to consider serious
                            talks again. But the Koreans threaten “other action” if a settlement is
                            not reached by the end of the year.</p>

                            countries are exceedingly complex. State has been reluctant to see us
                            get involved too directly, lest we incur the onus of an unpopular
                            settlement or end up paying a large portion of the bill. Nonetheless,
                            our interests dictate an early resolution of this issue in a manner
                            which will bring Japan to assume a greater share of the burden of
                            subsidizing South Korea—a matter at least as important to Japan's
                            security as to ours.</p>

                        <p>Having read the recent dispatches from Seoul and Tokyo,<note n="1" xml:id="d256fn1">See <ref target="#d255fn1">footnote 1, Document
                                    255</ref>.</note> I am concerned over the apparent impasse which
                            has again developed between Japan and South Korea over the issues which
                            they have been discussing for so long. Since these negotiations have
                            been progressing fitfully for <pb n="557" xml:id="pg_557" facs="0593"/>over a decade, I believe that we must make every effort to bring them
                            to a prompt and successful conclusion.</p>
                        <p>One facet of the problem which particularly worries me is that time does
                            not seem to be on the Korean side; as time passes, the Japanese will
                            probably see less and less incentive to agree to a settlement which will
                            provide as much help as we desire toward strengthening the South Korean
                            economy.</p>
                        <p>I recognize the complexities involved in this painful negotiation, and
                            the undesirability of the US being put in the middle. On the other hand,
                            if certain pressures or inducements from the US turn out to be essential
                            to bring the two parties together, we may want to run these risks. I
                            also note that the Department of State may recommend messages from me to
                            both parties at an appropriate time. I would be happy to weigh in if
                            necessary.</p>
                        <p>While recognizing the need for tactical flexibility as to timing,
                            particularly in view of <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName>'s
                            reluctance to proceed much further until after the Diet session, his
                            upper house elections, and his own re-election as party chief, I hope
                            that we can try to keep up momentum toward a settlement, using US good
                            officers to the extent required. Therefore, may I have a report by 15
                            May on what plan of action you consider would most effectively bring the
                            negotiations to a successful conclusion.</p>

                        <p>The Japanese government has given no assistance to South Korea since the
                            end of World War II. The governments still have not established normal
                                <pb n="558" xml:id="pg_558" facs="0594"/>diplomatic relations,
                            although a Korean mission in Tokyo remains from US occupation days. A
                            few private business deals may bring some Japanese investment to Korea
                            soon, but amounts will be negligible until normal relations are
                            established.</p>
                        <p>Trade has been small ($22.8 million to Japan, $123.8 million to Korea in
                            1961). Although the above amounts to over half of Korea's puny exports,
                            the balance has heavily favored Japan. A desire for Japanese development
                            assistance is the chief reason why General Pak wants a settlement with
                            Japan.</p>
                        <p>It is also why we feel the success of the present round of Jap-<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> negotiations is so important, and have
                            suggested to you an <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss> asking State
                            to consider what we can do to bring the two together. It won't be easy
                            to talk the Japanese into assuming their share of the burden in aiding
                            the underdeveloped world—except where they see profit. But history and
                            geography make Jap-<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> cooperation
                            essential, if we can just break through the emotionalism and animosity
                            dating from 35 years of Japanese rule in South Korea.</p>

                        <p>DEAR <persName corresp="#p_HF1">FOWLER</persName>: As you know, the
                            Department of Defense has set up two major studies directed to the final
                            decision on Korean force levels to be reached in accordance with <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Action No. 2447.<note n="1" xml:id="d258fn1">See <ref target="#d251">Document 251</ref>.</note>

                        <p>One of these studies is a <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> analysis
                            from a purely military standpoint.<note n="2" xml:id="d258fn2">
                                <ref target="#d254">Document 254</ref>.</note> I expect to confer on
                            this in the near future and will then forward it to you with my
                            statement of the final Defense position. I am, however, attaching at
                            this time the parallel study performed by a special group under
                                <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Paul Nitze</persName>'s office, headed
                            by Major General <persName corresp="#p_CMGJB1">John B. Cary</persName>,
                                <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> (Ret.), who was borrowed from
                            the Institute of Defense Analyses for the purposes of this study.<note n="3" xml:id="d258fn3">As outlined in the introduction of the report
                                the task of the study group under Cary was to determine the most
                                desirable force posture for the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                                for 1962 -1970. The group was specifically enjoined to consider
                                possible alternative basic policies for the defense of Korea.</note>
                            I am anxious that your staff review this study, on a limited circulation
                            basis because of its sensitive nature, in order to be sure that we are
                            not in any serious divergence concerning the economic analyses contained
                            therein. It is also, of course, appropriate that you yourself should
                            have this basic input to the total problem.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Paul Nitze</persName>'s office would welcome
                            informal staff contact and comment either through him or directly to the
                            action officer, Mr. Stephen Loftus.</p>
                        <p>I propose to proceed at this point by conferring with the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> and with the interested parties in my
                            office to arrive at a firm Defense Department position on this matter. I
                            hope to do so early in May, and will then be in touch with you about the
                            next steps to be taken.</p>

                        <p>VIII—Alternative Defense Policies</p>
                        <p>1. Of the many possible variations, three alternative defense policies
                            were adopted for investigation. These are described in some detail in
                            Annex M. They are summarized in the following paragraphs.</p>
                        <p>Option A</p>
                        <p>2. This option involves the provision of in-place forces in South Korea,
                            which, together with available U.S. and <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> reinforcements, can contain, on a non-nuclear basis, an
                            attack by North Korea alone. Since any major North Korean military
                            operation requires Chinese Communist support and agreement, and at least
                            tacit assent by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, and since the
                            Chinese have previously demonstrated their willingness to intervene if
                            necessary to preserve North Korea as a Communist state, the question
                            immediately arises as to what is necessary to keep the Chinese out.
                            Since, under this assumed defense policy, it is not in-place military
                            forces in South Korea, it follows that there must be some other military
                            sanction available of sufficient strength and credibility to cause the
                            Chinese to refrain from open intervention. This military sanction now
                            exists. It is visible to the Chinese in the form of U.S. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>]
                            forces now in the area.</p>
                        <p>Option C</p>
                        <p>3. This option is essentially the present defense policy of the U.S. with
                            regard to South Korea—that is, to be able to contain, on a non-nuclear
                            basis, open aggression by combined ChiCom/KorCom forces. [<hi rend="italic">2 lines of source text not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>Option B</p>
                        <p>4. This assumed defense policy is identical with Option C, except that it
                            envisages immediate use [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source
                                text not declassified</hi>] by the defending forces. It was assumed
                            that the Chinese would retaliate with whatever indigenous [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line</hi>
                            <hi rend="italic">of source text not declassified</hi>] they might have
                            after the U.S. initiated [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of</hi>
                            <hi rend="italic">source text not declassified</hi>] operations. In view
                            of the very few weapons estimated to be available to the Chinese, this
                            assumption would result in one-sided use of [<hi rend="italic">less than
                                1 line</hi>
                            <hi rend="italic">of source text not declassified</hi>] except for a
                            very few, area-type weapons deliverable by Red China. (Section VI

                        </p>
                        <p>5. Sub-studies made by or for the Study Group clearly indicate that there
                            would be an appreciable reduction in force requirements under this
                            Option as compared with Option C. The Study Group was unable, however,
                            to assess with any precision the impact of [<hi rend="italic">3 lines of
                                source text not declassified</hi>]. No further attention, therefore,
                            has been devoted to this Option.</p>

                        <p>6. In all three Options, it has been assumed that the mission of the
                            defending forces is limited to containment of the initial Communist
                            offensive. No geographic requirement is assumed except that there be
                            retained sufficient depth to permit a further <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> buildup if that should be necessary. It will be noted
                            that this mission is somewhat at variance with the present mission of
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> forces, which at least implies a
                            requirement to retain Seoul, and which requires readiness to conduct a
                            subsequent counter-offensive.</p>
                        <p>7. Two analytical sub-studies were made for the Study Group to serve as
                            yardsticks for air and ground force requirements under Options A and C.

                            and X. Option C is considered first, so that a situation which
                            represents essentially the present defense policy can serve as a basis
                            for analysis of change.</p>

                            the responsible Commanders. It is emphasized that these analyses are
                            based upon the large number of assumptions and estimates, some of a
                            highly tenuous nature, set forth elsewhere in this study and
                            particularly in Annex L. Even though the results of the analyses are set
                            forth in direct terms, they are not intended and should not be construed
                            to be of an absolute or categorical nature, since they are highly
                            sensitive to the validity of the assumptions and estimates used.</p>

                        <p>XII—Over-All Conclusion</p>
                        <p>1. The Study Group, in comparing the two assumed defense policies
                            (Options A and C) examined in this study, believes that Option A—if its
                            adoption were linked to some highly significant and publicly evident
                            change in the political or military situation, and if based on firm U.S.
                            resolve to use its nuclear strength as necessary—would provide strong
                            assurance that South Korea would not be attacked, and probably that it
                            could not be successfully attacked. If it had been adopted earlier (in
                            connection, <pb n="562" xml:id="pg_562" facs="0598"/>say, with the
                            withdrawal of Red Chinese forces from North Korea), political and
                            economic advantage would probably have ensued.</p>
                        <p>2. The Study Group considers that a reduction in <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces of the magnitude which would result from
                            adoption of Option A, would, under present circumstances, entail risks
                            and disadvantages which far outweigh any potential economic advantage
                            which might ensue.</p>
                        <p>3. Circumstances which would permit the early adoption of a defense
                            policy entailing dramatic reductions in <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> military strength, without jeopardy to U.S. objectives
                            and position, must include a prior, major improvement in the political
                            and economic environments within South Korea, and additionally some
                            visible political or military event at least approaching the
                            significance of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> force
                            reduction.</p>
                        <p>4. The Study Group concludes, therefore, that the defense policy of the
                            U.S. for the security of South Korea should not now undergo drastic
                            revision and that the armed forces of the Republic of Korea should
                            remain at approximately the level now programmed.</p>

                        <p>This is a fascinating document. The Cary group agrees that “Option A” (a
                            six division cut) is militarily reasonable if some sanction exists to
                            keep Communist China from attacking the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> and that this sanction does exist in the form of US

                                “would probably not in itself increase the likelihood of invasion

                            at the time of withdrawal of ChiCom forces from Korea, it would have
                            been advantageous, and might again be feasible in the future if events
                            provide some similar justification.</p>

                        <p>However, the report opposes such a cut at present, primarily, because it
                            would upset Pak's regime and secondarily because it would have adverse
                            repercussions on US allies throughout East Asia, who would see in it a
                            reduced US interest in their defense as well. The main argument seems to
                            be that the Pak regime would naturally be quite upset by a major cut in
                            its main base of support, the Army. Great political instability might
                            ensue. Thus the Cary Report seems to make its case against a force cut
                            not on military grounds but on the grounds that it would have political
                            repercussions undermining <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> political
                            (and by extension) economic stability.</p>
                        <p>This conclusion seems contestable on three grounds:</p>
                        <p>(1) It is supported primarily by some rather scary speculation. I am not
                            persuaded that a 135,000 man cut over three years, leaving <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces at a still sizable 460,000,
                            would create such dire risks. The new <gloss target="#t_SNIE1">SNIE</gloss> (42-62) seems to take a less gloomy view of these
                            repercussions, although not minimizing them. But the <gloss target="#t_SNIE1">SNIE</gloss> concludes that the Pak regime would
                            accept a force cut if pressed, and if adequate US reassurances were
                            given. Indeed, no one has assessed whether Pak himself might not prefer
                            a force cut if the hwan released plus dollars saved could be used to
                            support his new five year plan. It might be interesting to put this
                            proposition up to General Pak. Moreover, are we sure that a force cut
                            would be so politically unpopular as to promote instability, rather than
                            the reverse? Recall that <persName corresp="#p_CM1">Chang
                                Myon</persName> campaigned in 1960 on a platform of reducing the
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> army by 200,000 men, and got
                            elected. Then he attempted to press a 100,000 man force cut; the
                            opposition was from the US, not the ROK. Finally in December 1960 the US
                            agreed to a T/O cut from 630,000 to 600,000. I also recall seeing a
                            paper written by General Chung Il-Kwon, three times ROK Chief of Staff,
                            in which he too argued for a much smaller ROK army. The initiation of a
                            major development program along the lines suggested by Pak might be the
                            dramatic and significant event which the Cary group says would be
                            necessary to justify a force cut.</p>
                        <p>(2) While the Cary Report devotes some attention to the subversive
                            threat, it makes no analysis of the comparative seriousness of internal
                            and external threats which is the guts of the problem. The Steering
                            Group argued (based on <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss>
                                14.2/42-61)<note n="3" xml:id="d259fn3">Printed in part as <ref target="#d243">Document 243</ref>.</note> that the greatest
                            threats to the security and stability of South Korea were not overt
                            attack but domestic weaknesses which would be politically exploited by
                            the <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> Communists.<note n="4" xml:id="d259fn4">In the report of the Military Assistance Steering
                                Group; see <ref target="#d251">Document 251</ref>.</note> Therefore,
                            while recognizing that an external threat still existed, it argued for
                            reducing somewhat our insurance against this contingency in order to
                            back adequately an intensified development effort. The new <pb n="564" xml:id="pg_564" facs="0600"/>
                            <gloss target="#t_SNIE1">SNIE</gloss> (42-62) bears out this need. In
                            effect, we face a necessity for choice in Korea between two legitimately
                            competing views.</p>
                        <p>(3) My third reservation applies to the economic argument. The Report
                            makes much of the limited capacity of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> economy to absorb new outside capital. Maybe so, but it
                            also emphasizes the constant <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> problem
                            of avoiding large government deficits which create inflation. It notes
                            that to do so will require either substantial hwan diversions from the
                            military budget or substantial reductions in government investment for
                            economic development below the level projected in the five year plan (p.
                            18). Thus we do have a real competition for resources. Incidentally, the
                            report dismisses the argument that force cuts would seriously complicate
                            the unemployment problem by pointing out that to add 135,000 to 2.7
                            million already unemployed, would not be an economic catastrophe (p.
                            52).</p>
                        <p>It is also notable that the military analysis indicates that Communist
                            air superiority would be of very short duration in any conflict (p. 42).
                            Indeed, by employing US forces available in the theatre we could build
                            up to an 800-plane offensive air strength by D plus 8. Of course, this
                            is based on providing the ROK air defenses called for in current MAP
                            planning.</p>
                        <p>The Report simply dismisses the likelihood of a successful NK attack
                            against even a 12-division force (pp. 45-46). Thus the real military
                            issue is whether we want to maintain the present much larger ROK force
                            against the contingency of a combined ChiCom/NK attack. Is this remote
                            contingency sufficient military rationale for the present ROK force
                            structure? [<hi rend="italic">5 lines of source text not

                        <p>In sum, therefore, the Cary Report can be read as justification for a six
                            division cut in <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces unless the
                            political repercussions are too great. This is a question of judgment,
                            on which the Cary group's pronouncements do not seem to me to be
                            particularly compelling and on which other judgments exist (e.g. those
                            in the <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss>s and those of State in
                            endorsing the Steering Group Report last year).</p>

                            appropriate action to bring the negotiations between Japan and the
                            Republic of Korea to a successful conclusion.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> discussed this
                            problem at length with our Ambassadors in Tokyo and Seoul, and with
                            Japanese and Korean Government leaders, during his recent trip to the
                            Far East. It was evident from these conversations, as well as from the
                            subsequent reporting of both Embassies, that the principal obstacle to a
                            settlement at present is the gap between unrealistically high Korean
                            claims against Japan, arising out of the Japanese occupation, and
                            unrealistically low Japanese counter-offers. The Koreans have indicated
                            to us a willingness to settle for considerably less than they have
                            previously asked, but the Japanese seem less willing to settle than they
                            were at the end of last year.</p>
                        <p>United States influence toward a settlement should, therefore, be exerted
                            at this stage more on the Japanese than on the Koreans. However, our
                            ability to influence the Japanese on the question of their relations
                            with Korea is limited. Prime Minister Ikeda is reluctant to take the
                            political risks which he believes such a settlement would involve for
                            him, especially before the House of Councillors and Liberal-Democratic
                            Party elections in July of this year. The Japanese, however, may be
                            willing to raise their offer and pursue a settlement more actively after
                            their elections are out of the way.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, I understand that former Prime Minister Yoshida in a
                            conversation with you on May 3 agreed as to the importance of a
                            settlement with Korea, although he, too, felt it must wait until those
                            elections have taken place.<note n="2" xml:id="d260fn2">According to the
                                memorandum of conversation of the Kennedy-Yoshida meeting on May 3:
                                “The President underlined the importance he placed on the settlement
                                of Japanese/Korean relations and urged that this be done. Mr.
                                Yoshida said he fully agreed that the question ought to be settled
                                and settled promptly, but that it should wait until after the
                                senatorial elections in June. The President underlined that we had
                                protected the security of Korea largely because of its importance to
                                the security of Japan. Korea could not achieve healthy economic
                                growth without close economic relations with Japan, and the
                                President implied that now was the time for Japan to do her share.”
                                (Department of State, Central Files, 611.94/5-362)</note> Therefore,
                            I would assume that Mr. Yoshida's considerable <pb n="566" xml:id="pg_566" facs="0602"/>prestige and influence may prove
                            helpful in inducing Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> to move decisively toward a rapprochement with
                            Korea, beginning sometime this summer.</p>
                        <p>In the interim we hope to utilize possibilities for Korean development
                            now being explored by third countries to stimulate interest of the two
                            sides, and particularly of the Japanese, in a settlement. We have in
                            mind interest the Germans are showing in giving supplier credits for a
                            steel mill, perhaps to be followed by credits for a fertilizer plant,
                            shipyard, coal mines and coal cars. Moreover, at the present time a
                            group led by General Van Fleet is in Korea investigating possibilities
                            for investment by a number of important American firms. We hope that the
                            Japanese will decide they do not want to be left behind. In any case,
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JSJ1">Janow</persName>, Assistant
                            Administrator of <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>, is shortly to
                            visit Japan and Korea, perhaps accompanied by a political officer. There
                            he is to assess developing attitudes, ask questions and stimulate
                            interest. We hope that this also will help allay the restiveness of the
                            Koreans by giving some sense of forward motion. <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> is also studying incentives which we might offer the
                            two Governments to encourage a settlement. Such a settlement, required
                            by the self-interest of both parties, will of course require that each
                            move toward the other's position on Korean claims and, we think, that
                            Korea accept Japanese loans as part of the settlement “package”.
                            Messages from you to both parties might at some point help materially to
                            precipitate a settlement. For the present, however, I believe we should
                            keep such possible measures in reserve for a time when they may be
                            expected to have the desired effect.<note n="3" xml:id="d260fn3">At the

                                after the Japanese elections on 1 July. The fear is that the
                                Japanese will just walk off and drop any attempt to reach an
                                agreement with the Koreans.” <persName>Bundy</persName> remarked
                                that he had spoken to Vice President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> about going to Japan and hoped he could do

                        <p>KOREAN-JAPANESE RELATIONS</p>
                        <p>(Background paper for use in connection with the meeting of the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Standing Group, May 18, 1962)</p>
                        <p>I. General Considerations</p>
                        <p>1. Prospects for early normalization of relations between the Republic of
                            Korea and Japan are not bright. From 1952 to 1960, normalization was
                            impossible because of Korean ex-President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>'s intransigent anti-Japanese position. A new Korean
                            administration gave hope that a settlement could be achieved, although
                            its expectations were unrealistically high. Japanese conservative
                            leaders in 1961 apparently decided in favor of a settlement. Now,
                            however, the Japanese wish to “go slow” because of domestic political
                            pressures and current balance of payments difficulties. They also
                            believe that time is on their side. Nevertheless, despite lack of
                            progress, neither the Koreans nor the Japanese seem to contemplate a
                            rupture in negotiations, which are continuing at working levels.</p>
                        <p>2. It continues to be in the United States interest to promote an early
                            settlement of differences between the Republic of Korea and Japan, for
                            the following reasons:</p>
                        <p>a. Rapid Korean economic development, crucially necessary for stability,
                            would be materially accelerated by Japanese economic aid additive to
                            continued U.S. aid.</p>
                        <p>b. Korea would gain greater access to Japanese markets for her exports,
                            thus providing further major stimulus to Korean economic
                            development.</p>
                        <p>c. A significant impediment to Free World unity and strength in Asia
                            would be removed.</p>
                        <p>d. <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> prestige would be bolstered in the
                            increasingly serious competition with the Communist North Korean
                            regime.</p>
                        <p>3. United States leverage to induce a settlement is limited by the
                            following factors:</p>
                        <pb n="568" xml:id="pg_568" facs="0604"/>
                        <p>a. The Japanese believe the U.S. must support Korea in any event, and see
                            no reason for haste in assuming any portion of the economic burden
                            themselves, especially since they suspect that we are trying to reduce
                            our own burden thereby, and believe that passage of time will make a
                            cheaper settlement possible.</p>
                        <p>b. The Japanese Prime Minister is reluctant to proceed with a settlement
                            because (1) he believes that any large contribution to Korea would be
                            unpopular in Japan because of popular prejudice against the Koreans; (2)
                            the Japanese Left is opposed to any settlement with the anti-Communist
                            Republic, and would use the issue against the Government; (3) elements
                            within the ruling conservative party in Japan seek to use the Korean
                            problem as a device for weakening the Prime Minister's leadership
                            position. These factors carry particular weight with <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> prior to the Upper House and
                            Conservative Party elections scheduled for July.</p>
                        <p>c. The Koreans also fear we will sell them out to Japan economically in
                            order to lessen our foreign aid burden.</p>
                        <p>d. Both sides resent any American role that could be interpreted as
                            interference (almost any overt U.S. role would be so interpreted by
                            Communist propaganda and by the Japanese Left). At the same time, each
                            side is constantly seeking to invoke U.S. influence and money against
                            the other in a complex tangle of issues where a misstep for the U.S.
                            would be very easy and could be quite damaging.</p>
                        <p>e. With Japan once again a world power, and in the present state of
                            Japan-U.S. relations, we cannot force Japan to act except in accordance
                            with her own conception of her national interest.</p>
                        <p>f. Despite the enormous leverage our aid gives us in Korea, our influence
                            there would be seriously weakened by forcing the Koreans to settle with
                            Japan at levels materially lower than they believe reasonable.</p>
                        <p>g. Under these circumstances, United States pressure, if injudiciously
                            applied, might well retard a settlement rather than promote it.</p>
                        <p>II. Issues between Korea and Japan</p>
                        <p>4. The principal issues outstanding between Korea and Japan are: (a)
                            Korean claims for compensation, based on Japanese occupation from 1910
                            to 1945, including North as well as South Korea, (b) Korean claims of
                            exclusive fishing rights within an extensive and legally untenable
                            “Peace Line,” 50 to 200 miles at sea. Other minor issues are: (c) Korean
                            art objects in Japan, (d) status of Korean residents in Japan, (e)
                            repatriation of Koreans to North Korea, (f) sovereignty over Tokto or
                            Takeshima (Liancourt Rocks), an inconsequential islet in the Japan Sea,
                            (g) claims for vessels taken by Japan from Korea in 1945. The occupation
                            claims issue is the principal bone of contention, and if it can be

                        <p>III. U.S. Policy and Objectives</p>
                        <p>5. United States policy has been, and continues to be, to “influence the
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> and Japan to negotiate a
                            settlement of their differences through a realistic and forthcoming
                            attitude on both sides, and to normalize their relations without,
                            however, placing the United States in the position of mediator.” To this
                            end, the United States has the following immediate objectives:</p>
                        <p>a. To keep contact between the Koreans and the Japanese, at least at the
                            technical level, and avoid any rupture of negotiations.</p>
                        <p>b. To persuade both sides that it is in their interest to settle now, and
                            that delay will be contrary to their own interests.</p>
                        <p>c. To convince both sides that Japanese economic aid (under whatever
                            name) will not supplant, but supplement, continuing high-level U.S.
                            assistance.</p>
                        <p>d. To bring about the resumption of negotiations at a high political
                            level as soon as possible, and to induce a reasonable over-all
                            settlement of outstanding issues without public evidence of United
                            States coercion or interference.</p>
                        <p>IV. Recent U.S. Actions</p>
                        <p>6. Our Ambassadors in Tokyo and Seoul, in continuing informal contacts
                            with the Japanese and Korean governments at various levels, are urging
                            flexibility, restraint, and a forthcoming attitude on both sides,
                            looking toward a resumption of negotiations at a higher level in July or
                            August after the Japanese elections. The Koreans are being urged to
                            lower their figure for claims against Japan from the $700 million
                            currently asked, and probably will do so if talks are resumed. The
                            Japanese are being urged to raise their offer for compensation and
                            economic assistance grants above the unrealistically low level of $70
                            million (made to the Koreans in negotiations between the Foreign
                            Ministers last March).</p>
                        <p>7. Meetings among senior officers in the Department of State (including
                                <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>) on April 16 and May 15<note n="1" xml:id="d261fn1">The record of the April 16 meeting is

                        <p>V. The Current Situation</p>
                        <p>9. In a conversation with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_REO1">Reischauer</persName> on April 18, Japanese Foreign Minister Kosaka
                            made clear [<hi rend="italic">1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>] the lack of progress in the March talks. He added
                            that Korean persistence in unreasonable claims “might create
                            anti-American feeling in Japan because of the U.S. role in confiscating
                            private Japanese property in Korea in violation of international
                            law.”</p>
                        <p>10. The <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Foreign Minister, in a talk
                            with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName> on April
                            24, indicated that the Koreans would refrain from public statements on
                            Korea- Japan relations, and intended to keep the door open to visits by
                            Japanese officials and newsmen.</p>
                        <p>11. A four-man Japanese economic fact-finding mission, headed by
                            Yoshihiro Nakayama, Director of the Foreign Ministry's Economic Affairs
                            Bureau, visited Korea in late April. Nakayama had a frank discussion
                            with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName> in Seoul,
                            which should do much to promote Japanese understanding of the Korean
                            situation and our position.</p>
                        <p>12. In an appraisal on April 29, working-level Japanese Foreign Office
                            officials reflected less gloom about the danger of a hostile rupture in
                            negotiations. They were seeking ways in which both governments could
                            foster a constructive atmosphere, pending a new impetus toward
                            rapprochement. They stated, however, that the Japanese Government was
                            proceeding on the assumption that <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> would not authorize any major negotiating effort
                            before the Japanese elections.</p>
                        <p>13. On May 16, Japanese Foreign Office officials confidentially informed
                            our Embassy that the Koreans had approved a small rotating Japanese
                            mission in Seoul, to be staffed by a series of “visitors,” beginning
                            with Toshio Urabe, Counselor of the Foreign Ministry's Asian Affairs
                            Bureau. Urabe may have access to Korean <gloss target="#t_SCNR1">SCNR</gloss> Chairman Park, in which case the locus of informal
                            discussions may shift to Seoul. Such talks would be the best way to
                            maximize prospects for subsequent high-level negotiations.</p>
                        <p>14. The Japanese have signed an agreement to import 40 thousand tons of
                            Korean rice this year, in return for which the Koreans will purchase
                            fertilizer.</p>
                        <p>15. The Koreans have recently seized additional Japanese fishing boats
                            allegedly within the “<persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> Line,”
                            but the seizures have apparently not attracted major attention.</p>
                        <p>16. On balance, it appears that there is a continuing willingness on both
                            sides to keep communication channels open; that the Koreans are willing
                            to make a claims settlement at somewhat less than their asking figure
                            (Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName> estimated
                            $350-450 million in compensation and grants (exclusive of credits and
                            loans) in his conversation with Nakayama); and that a settlement is
                            possible if the Japanese leadership <pb n="571" xml:id="pg_571" facs="0607"/>can be motivated to make a decision in favor of a
                            settlement at a higher cost than they have so far been prepared to
                            accept.</p>

                            every Korean Government has pressed for such negotiations. Meanwhile,
                            the Commander of the U.S. forces in Korea has continued to exercise

                        <p>The Defense Department long opposed a status of forces agreement because
                            of the unique state of suspended hostilities in Korea and the presumably
                            unsatisfactory Korean legal system. In April 1961, however, with Defense
                            Department agreement, negotiations for a full status of forces agreement
                            were begun.<note n="4" xml:id="d262fn4">See <ref target="#d209fn3">footnote 3, Document 209</ref>.</note> When the civil

                        <p>In June 1961, the new military government requested that the United
                            States reopen negotiations, but in view of the unstable situation and
                            uncertainty at that time as to the intentions of the regime, this

                            Government would be willing to reopen negotiations provided it could
                            obtain a written commitment in advance that the question of criminal
                            jurisdiction would not be raised for discussion until a new
                            constitutional government had been formed (scheduled for next year) and
                            normal legal processes had been fully restored.<note n="5" xml:id="d262fn5">The Embassy was instructed in telegram 1041 to

                        <p>On June 9 the United States reiterated this basic proposal, but dropped

                            rejected by Chairman Pak, who speculated that the problem might be
                            handled by placing the subject of criminal jurisdiction on the status of
                            forces agenda but postponing discussion from time to time. The Foreign
                            Minister later said that the government was prepared to pass a “special
                            law” regarding the U.S. and <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> forces in
                            Korea which would meet U.S. standards. He indicated that this could be
                            done during the coming year, apparently concurrently with status of
                            forces negotiations.</p>
                        <p>In the last week, a number of Korean student demonstrations have occurred
                            in Seoul and elsewhere, protesting recent unfortunate incidents
                            involving U.S. military personnel, and demanding a status of forces
                            agreement. These demonstrations apparently were not inspired by the
                            government, and they reflect a genuine nationalistic feeling which
                            regards a status of forces agreement as an essential symbol of
                            sovereignty. The Koreans are well aware of the fact that the United
                            States has, or is negotiating, status of forces agreements with other
                            countries in which large U.S. forces are maintained.</p>
                        <p>In this connection, Koreans can point out that the United States has an
                            agreement covering all its <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies,
                            an agreement with Japan, and a base agreement with the Philippines. They
                            know that the United States is negotiating an agreement with the
                            Republic of China. Not unnaturally, they feel that the United States

                                danger to government stability as emotionalism generated got out of
                                hand.” Berger stated that the Department could “rely on <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> assurances postpone discussions
                                jurisdiction for some time and then discuss at leisurely pace.” He
                                proposed that the negotiations be resumed in July on this basis and
                                with the understanding that an agreement could not be signed until
                                normal constitutional and legal procedures were restored in South
                                Korea. (Ibid., 611.95B7/6-1262)</note>

                        </list>
                        <p>I have discussed the progress of our negotiations on the Korean Status of
                            Forces Agreement (“<gloss target="#t_SOFA1">SOFA</gloss>”) with Messrs
                                <persName corresp="#p_REE1">Rice</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_YJA1">Yager</persName> in State and Mr. Lang in Defense
                                (<gloss target="#t_ISA1">ISA</gloss>).</p>
                        <p>Talks on this subject have been going on intermittently since August 1953
                            when Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> agreed to
                            prompt <gloss target="#t_SOFA1">SOFA</gloss> negotiations after the
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> signed a Mutual Defense
                            Treaty.</p>
                        <p>In 1958 the Defense Department made a study of the criminal law and legal
                            procedures of Korea and concluded that several important changes would
                            have to be made both in the penal code and in the administration of
                            justice before the United States could submit its personnel to Korean
                            criminal jurisdiction. The results of this study have never been given
                            to the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>.</p>
                        <pb n="574" xml:id="pg_574" facs="0610"/>
                        <p>In April 1961 actual negotiations were finally begun but with the
                            understanding that there would be no agreement on criminal jurisdiction
                            unless arrangements could be made to assure fair trials by U.S.
                            standards to U.S. personnel. The Korean Government fell shortly after
                            the opening of negotiations and was replaced by a military junta.
                            Negotiations were thereupon suspended, both State and Defense agreeing
                            that they should not be renewed until civil government and civil
                            administration of justice was restored.</p>
                        <p>In May of this year we again agreed to start negotiations on a <gloss target="#t_SOFA1">SOFA</gloss> but only on the understanding that
                            there would be no discussion of criminal jurisdiction. After the recent
                            unpleasant incidents, we reaffirmed essentially this position, but the
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> has refused to negotiate without
                            discussing what they consider the most important attribute of a status
                            of forces agreement, i.e. criminal jurisdiction.</p>
                        <p>Comment: I asked both State and Defense to explain why it is not possible
                            to begin discussions immediately on an overall <gloss target="#t_SOFA1">SOFA</gloss> including a criminal jurisdiction. State's position is
                            a little wobbly. They mainly want to use the issue of the <gloss target="#t_SOFA1">SOFA</gloss> as a means of compelling the
                            restoration of a civilian government. Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>, however, is inclined to go
                            ahead with negotiations if <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Sam
                                Berger</persName>, our ambassador, concurs.</p>
                        <p>Defense's position is clearer and tougher. They are unwilling to make
                            even a first step towards an agreement covering criminal jurisdiction
                            under the present circumstances. To do so, they think, would only make
                            incidents like the recent ones even more dangerous, since they would
                            increase the pressure for signing an agreement on criminal
                            jurisdiction.</p>
                        <p>In light of the obvious political beating we appear to be taking in Korea
                            now, I would think that we could agree to begin negotiations on a <gloss target="#t_SOFA1">SOFA</gloss> in Korea. We obviously should not
                            sign an agreement until the military lawyers are satisfied that
                            appropriate safeguards have been obtained; but I don't see how we can
                            refuse even to negotiate.<note n="1" xml:id="d263fn1">In a memorandum to

                        <p>In the last analysis, I should think that what we really care about is
                            the physical safety of our people. I wonder why it isn't possible when
                            we have doubts about the local courts to agree to the criminal
                            jurisdiction of the host country and also agree as an executive matter
                            that U.S. personnel convicted of crimes and sentenced would be, at our
                            request, expelled from the country. This would tend to solve the

                            the latest developments in Korea. Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName> then
                            asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_YJA1">Yager</persName> to speak to cover
                            this item. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_YJA1">Yager</persName> said that
                            the situation in Korea is a disturbing one. The present military
                            government has the attributes of efficiency and is attempting
                            progressive modernization. However, there are signs that the leaders are
                            losing self-confidence. They are worried about their lack of effective
                            progress and cliques are beginning to develop among the ruling classes.
                            The <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> is not acting properly; it is

                            reports that it is engaged in massive financial corruption. We had hoped
                            to receive an overall situation report from Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName> by today, but he has deferred
                            submitting his report in view of the fast moving situation. We hope to
                            have this report in the near future.<note n="1" xml:id="d264fn1">The

                                the Country Team stated that the present situation in Korea was best
                                described as a “power and policy struggle which has created a
                                condition of instability in top leadership and tension in the
                                country.” The resignation of President <persName corresp="#p_SY1">Song Yo-chan</persName>, infighting within the <gloss target="#t_SCNR1">SCNR</gloss>, coup plotting outside and
                                possibly inside the government, massive student demonstrations,

                                situation, but the Country Team considered <gloss target="#t_KCIA1">KCIA</gloss> Director <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim

                        <p>Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName> emphasized that the recent currency
                            conversion and reform was undertaken without our knowledge and that this
                            is a bad development. The <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> leaders
                            knew that we would disapprove the proposal if they had discussed it with
                            us in advance. We are still not clear on many of the detailed aspects of
                            the new program. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_YJA1">Yager</persName> said
                            that there probably will be a heavy levy against capitalists and wealthy
                            persons with a resultant harm to business and a slow down of capital
                            investment and expansion. Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName> said that if
                            the present trend continues with respect to our relations with the
                            Korean Government, we may have to take a hard look at our policy
                            vis-a-vis the Park Government. In response to Admiral <persName corresp="#p_AAGW1">Anderson</persName>'s question, Mr.
                                <persName>Johnson</persName> indicated that he was not prepared to
                            say just what such a policy review would entail. Mr.
                                <persName>Johnson</persName> also informed Admiral <persName corresp="#p_AAGW1">Anderson</persName> that the message to

                        </list>
                        <p>I was recently briefed on the Cary Report<note n="1" xml:id="d265fn1">Printed in part as an attachment to <ref target="#d258">Document
                                    258</ref>.</note> on the possible reduction of MAP supported
                            military forces in Korea. I understand it has pleased no one since it
                            does not come up with an easy solution to the problem of reducing force
                            levels. I am also aware that the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>
                            have reviewed the matter and come out strongly for the maintenance of
                            the present levels.</p>
                        <pb n="577" xml:id="pg_577" facs="0613"/>
                        <p>I have three observations to make on the matter. The first is that it is
                            highly unlikely that responsible U.S. military authorities will ever
                            recommend a reduction in Korean force levels unless assured of the
                            availability of [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>] in case of the intervention in Korea of ChiCom
                            forces in significant strength. With such an assurance, they would be
                            justified in limiting the mission of South Korean forces to off-setting
                            the North Korean establishment. Without that assurance [<hi rend="italic">1-1/2 lines of source text not declassified</hi>]
                            there is no military ground to support a substantial cut in Korean
                            conventional forces.</p>
                        <p>[<hi rend="italic">1 paragraph (3-1/2 lines of source text) not
                                declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>A final comment is to wonder why, with all the pressure on the Department
                            of Defense to support a reduction in the level of Korean forces, has the
                            State Department never been asked to find a political solution to the
                            armistice impasse? The North Koreans and their supporters must be just
                            as tired of the present situation as we are. A minimum political
                            objective would be to secure agreement on both sides to dismantle the
                            fortified front and to maintain a frontier no more heavily defended than
                            the frontier separating, say, Czechoslovakia from West Germany. Why do
                            we not ask our diplomats to ply at their trade of negotiations?</p>

                            considered to govern US actions for promoting normalization of relations
                            between Republic of Korea and Japan.</p>
                        <p>2. US objective is to bring about a settlement of outstanding differences
                            and establishment normal diplomatic and economic relations between
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> and Japan, in order reduce
                            tensions and promote security in Western Pacific and increase rate of
                            Korean economic development.</p>
                        <p>3. General US course of action should be: (a) to stress to both sides the
                            advantages of a settlement in their own respective national interests;
                            (b) to use US influence and good offices with both sides to bring about
                            settlement through realistic, forthcoming, and reasonable negotiation;
                            (c) to suggest to both sides the use of well established Japanese-Korean
                            practice of go-between for prior confidential exchange of information
                            concerning range of settlement figures that will be acceptable at formal
                            negotiations, and to act as go-between if requested; (d) if necessary to
                            encourage both sides to look to US for confidential transmission of
                            messages; (e) to seek discreetly to serve during course of negotiations
                            as confidential informants to Chairman Pak and (if necessary) to
                            Japanese Prime Minister on course of negotiations and conduct of
                            negotiators; (f) to avoid rupture of negotiations or talks; (g) to
                            maintain disinterested posture toward special interests of parties,
                            playing role of catalyst but not acting as a party to negotiations.
                            Specific actions are set forth in following paragraphs.</p>
                        <p>4. As soon as practicable following <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName>'s reappointment as Prime Min and formation new
                            Japanese Cabinet, and subject to conditions reasonable political
                            stability Korea, US Ambassador Tokyo will approach Prime Min and prevail
                            upon him to set early date for resuming negotiations with Korea at
                            political level, preferably in Seoul.</p>
                        <p>5. Subject to consultation between US Ambassadors Seoul and Tokyo, Seoul
                            will approach <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> at highest level,
                            prevailing upon Koreans (a) to think in terms of claims settlement
                            package of reasonable proportions including claims payments, grants, and
                            long-term soft loans which can be accepted as package without emphasis
                            on claims; (b) to name as their chief negotiator an individual who will
                            deal effectively, reasonably and authoritatively with the Japanese.</p>
                        <pb n="580" xml:id="pg_580" facs="0616"/>
                        <p>6. In this connection, Embassies Tokyo and Seoul will immediately
                            undertake review all outstanding issues between <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> and Japan, ascertaining positions of two sides and
                            differences between them, with view to determining whether differences
                            on fisheries or other issues aside from claims will impede overall
                            settlement if claims issue resolved. Embassies should recommend possible
                            US contribution toward settlement these issues, such as provision
                            technical consultants from US or other countries.</p>
                        <p>7. As basis for influencing Japanese, Embassy Tokyo will stress in
                            representations to <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> officials the
                            European and US business interest in Korean development.</p>
                        <p>8. Japanese officials should also be discreetly reminded of recent US
                            cooperation in encouraging Korean-Japanese trade despite our own
                            balance-of-payments problems—e.g., our facilitation of Korean
                            nitrogenous fertilizer purchases; our provision of barley to Korea under
                            PL 480 so that Korea could barter rice for additional fertilizer.</p>
                        <p>9. As basis for influencing Koreans, Embassy Seoul will stress in
                            representations to <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> officials that
                            in joint consultation re Five Year Economic Development Plan, <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> and US must consider all potential
                            capital resources additional to those of US, including Europe and
                            particularly Japan, as well as export market opportunities in Japan. If
                            additional pressure on the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            Government is required to produce a bargain in the face of reasonable
                            Japanese offer, US Development Lending may be related to this
                            settlement.</p>
                        <p>10. Embassy Seoul will also point out to Koreans the desirability of
                            publicity on fisheries issue designed to show (a) importance this issue
                            to both countries, (b) Korean willingness to negotiate reasonable
                            settlement. Such approach would give <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss>
                            useful domestic argument for settlement with <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>, and would remind Japanese of Korean bargaining
                            lever.</p>
                        <p>11. US Embassies Bonn, Paris, London, Rome and USRO will discreetly
                            promote European government and business interests in investment Korea
                            and offer US assistance in selecting suitable projects and examining
                            possibilities for US public or private participation.</p>
                        <p>12. Department will approach suitable individual to travel to Korea as
                            special representative to attend August 15 ceremonies Seoul and talk
                            with <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> leaders about development
                            problems (contingent upon favorable political situation Korea). Assuming
                            favorable reception by Koreans, same individual would visit Japan for
                            talks with <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> leaders and would
                            thereafter be available on standby basis to be called in as consultant
                            to both sides as appropriate. Representative could fulfill much of
                            purpose envisaged in Embassy Seoul's proposal for high-level envoy

                        <p>66. Country Team has reviewed current situation and provides following
                            assessment:</p>
                        <p>1. For almost two months military government has been undergoing its
                            greatest crisis since taking power. Leadership struggle at highest
                            levels has been coupled with economic dislocation stemming largely from
                            ill-advised monetary reform and stock market fiasco. Embassy and <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> have taken firm position on failure
                            of government to consult on matters of fundamental importance to our
                            relationship, and we also expressed clearly unfavorable consequences if
                            iniquitous aspects of monetary changes not removed. This has introduced
                            measure of strain in Embassy-<gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss>
                            relations and a feeling which may border on frustration and even anger
                            on part of certain people in <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss>,
                            although others have welcomed our initiative. Additionally, a mood of
                            pessimism and uncertainty has arisen in the country as result
                            government's economic faltering, evidences instability in leadership,
                            activities of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, and concern over problem of
                            transition to representative government.</p>
                        <p>2. It appears that worst of current crisis has passed. Undesirable
                            features of monetary reform have been rescinded. Some minor changes <pb n="582" xml:id="pg_582" facs="0618"/>in <gloss target="#t_SCNR1">SCNR</gloss> have been effected, a new team of economic
                            administrators has taken cabinet office and we are hopeful that more
                            fruitful relationship between Embassy, <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> and their <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss>
                            counterparts can be instituted. At the leadership level an uneasy truce
                            seems to have been achieved but factional clash which pitted <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim Chong-p</persName>'il and some of young
                            colonels against combination of Hamgyong and other anti-Kim elements
                            hovers over scene.</p>
                        <p>3. After wavering and despite heavy pressure Pak appears have decided
                            retain <persName>Kim</persName> in some position of significance,
                            whether as <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> [omission—head or?] figure elsewhere
                            in military government. While <persName>Kim</persName> may have his
                            freedom of maneuver and his exercise of power restricted to some extent
                            by Pak and may even be shifted, he still is a major force in military
                            government. <persName>Kim</persName> has not given up his efforts to
                            gain complete upper hand over his opponents, and this promises have
                            continuing unsettling effects.</p>
                        <p>4. Test of power between <persName>Kim</persName> and his opponents has
                            left each side wary of other. Pak carefully avoided taking sides since
                            he derives support from all contending elements. Nevertheless, he finds
                            himself faced with classic Korean factional struggle which has roots in
                            personal antipathies and ambitions and involves rival groups bound
                            together by common regional or education ties. Factionalism also plays
                            its part in bureaucratic rivalries, and is intensified by the
                            overlapping and often conflicting jurisdiction of <gloss target="#t_SCNR1">SCNR</gloss>, cabinet and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>5. Factional fighting is deeply rooted in Korean national character and
                            has been a continuous problem for Pak and this government. It played a
                            part in Chang To-young case and was feature of illicit fortune committee
                            case last [garble] <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim
                            Chong-p</persName>'il attacked Yi Chu-il. Similar attacks and
                            counter-attacks re-appeared in fight between <persName corresp="#p_SY1">Song Yo-chan</persName> and <persName>Kim</persName> early this
                            year and again in June. Latest outbreak occasioned by economic
                            activities of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> gave
                                <persName>Kim</persName>'s opponents their first big chance move
                            against him.</p>
                        <p>6. Retention and exercise of power by Pak has always required restraint
                            of factional fighting, and maintenance of balance between contending
                            forces. While it is significant that outcome of most recent fracas finds
                            most of young colonels and their leader <persName>Kim</persName> in
                            strong position, Hamgyong and other factions have also emerged intact.
                            In our opinion, conflict is only suspended and stability not assured
                            through next year's election. Meanwhile, worthwhile achievements of
                            regime have been obscured and its public reputation has suffered as
                            charges and counter-charges of corruption, bad advice, shady-dealings,
                            bad planning, economic retrogression, <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> repression, and coup-plotting have become common
                            knowledge.</p>
                        <p>7. Unsettling actions and disturbing tensions of past two months have
                            shaken our confidence in government's judgment. They have also <pb n="583" xml:id="pg_583" facs="0619"/>thrown doubt on ability and
                            willingness of military government to bring about satisfactory
                            (tolerable for the US) political evolution in Korea. Military government
                            has been approaching task of governing with dogmatic faith in their own
                            sometimes ill-formed ideas and belief that since their ends are lofty,
                            their means and even their mistakes are justified. Military government's
                            political image is tarnished by recent events; its leadership is at
                            odds; its opponents may seek capitalize on instability to bring about
                            drastic change; and government measures to control thought and deed in
                            Korea remains pervasive and could worsen.</p>
                        <p>8. Outlook for military government has become clouded and consequences
                            could be serious. We believe, however, that we must continue support Pak
                            and continue behave toward him and his government in manner showing
                            understanding of his problems and reflecting confidence in his
                            leadership. We should not, however, take open and unquestioning public
                            stance which will associate US without reservation with all actions and
                            policies of military government. Our eyes should be focused on promoting
                            peaceful transition to representative government while promoting
                            economic progress in Korea.</p>
                        <p>We should work on assumption that transition and election will be carried
                            out on schedule and successor government will have some measure of
                            constitutional legitimacy. We can also assume that revolutionary
                            leadership will seek perpetuate its objectives and control in any new
                            government. This is not necessarily an undesirable prospect. We should,
                            therefore, continue to work with present government but look forward to
                            its replacement by government more popularly based and resting on a
                            publicly approved constitution containing some measure of checks and
                            balances. We should maintain this strategy unless it becomes
                            unrealistic.</p>
                        <p>9. Pak remains our best hope in this situation. He is in position
                            maintain structure of government in transition period and through his
                            leadership we can hopefully expect a measure of stability.</p>
                        <p>10. Pak's problem centers on the difficult task of gaining widest
                            possible support in country, asserting his leadership of government, and
                            recapturing momentum of revolution which has faltered. In relations with
                            United States, Pak should appreciate and accept necessity of close
                            cooperation and consultation, and be prepared enlarge area and content
                            of consultation in economic and political spheres.</p>
                        <p>11. One consoling and stabilizing factor in midst this economic
                            uncertainty and high level power play has been loyalty of military
                            forces to government and also to United Nations Command. Chain of
                            command and command relationships have been firm and reliable. This
                            stability is anchor and foundation of military government's existence
                            and an area in which we have considerable influence. We should use this
                            to our advantage and avoid taking measures which would interrupt this
                            influence. Such actions as excessive force reductions or sharp
                            reductions <pb n="584" xml:id="pg_584" facs="0620"/>in MAP funds could
                            cause trouble. (Indeed <gloss target="#t_USFK1">USFK</gloss> believes
                            any force reduction would cause trouble.)</p>
                        <p>12. We have put great pressure on military government over past weeks,
                            with particular emphasis on undoing of monetary regulations. We have
                            also rightfully insisted on need for consultation. We have been careful
                            reiterate our confidence in Pak and readiness support his government in
                            reasonable courses of action. While insisting on fundamental
                            cooperation, and continuing offer objection to unreasonable actions, we
                            are seeking achieve greater rapport between military government and
                            United States, while pursuing Korean political and economic progress
                            which desirable in any event.</p>
                        <p>13. United States should not at this time involve itself directly in
                            factional power struggle among leaders. Resolution this problem should
                            be left to Pak and we should be prepared accept his solution if at all
                            possible, i.e., if it does not involve means or ends incompatible with
                            our objectives. In a deteriorating situation, however, we may have to
                            involve ourselves. For example, if <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim
                                Chong-p</persName>'il's power and actions become intolerable we may
                            have to throw our weight against him.</p>
                        <p>14. Probably best area for cooperation and obtaining forward momentum in
                            immediate future lies in economic field. In this area, where we retain
                            effective leverage, we can more readily assert ourselves in pursuit our
                            policy objectives.</p>
                        <p>15. <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> has proposed and <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> has agreed to a joint review of
                            government's financial and economic development position as of now. This
                            will involve full consideration of government's plans for <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> 1962 and <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> 1963. In this exercise we will continue press for sound
                                <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> economic policies,
                            concentrating our efforts on shorter term and priorities which can be
                            established for next two-three years.</p>
                        <p>16. In addition to above stated actions we propose:</p>
                        <p>A. Keep under review possible despatch of special envoy. We do not
                            believe this is opportune time for such visit and will elaborate on this
                            subject in separate message.</p>
                        <p>B. Low key, but steady expression of interest in problems surrounding
                            political evolution involved in transition to representative government.
                            We should exercise such influence as we can to obtain a tolerable
                            political solution.</p>
                        <p>C. As required use such other means as are available, [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] to influence
                            character and actions of this government.</p>
                        <p>17. As a final comment, we should accept fact that there is no over-night
                            solution to political and economic problems plaguing Korea. We should
                            recognize that cyclical variations in relationship between United States
                            and Korea are endemic. We must face fact that judicious intervention in
                            Korean internal affairs will continue be necessary. We will have to
                            guide and sometimes lecture them and sometimes we are going to anger <pb n="585" xml:id="pg_585" facs="0621"/>or frustrate them. In process
                            we have to be careful not alienate them, but we cannot sacrifice our
                            principles or our objectives for sake of momentary solutions or
                            transitory agreement. There is continuing test of will involved in our
                            relations with this government and we should preserve a firm but
                            reasonable posture.</p>

                        <p>General Van Fleet called by appointment at 10:00 a.m. With very few
                            preliminaries he turned immediately to the subject of the Korean
                            military government, of whom he said that “these are good boys”. He
                            stated that “everything is going fine” in Korea; and that the United
                            States should give these leaders our support. He referred to the new
                            Korean Cabinet appointments approvingly as bringing civilian bankers
                            into key posts. He urged that now was the time for the State Department
                            to make a suitable statement of United States support, to give
                            encouragement to the Korean Government. He complained of the effect of
                            Washington statements indicating lack of confidence in the military
                            government, and cited a statement attributed to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> that if Korea were to become a
                            state-run economy, it should not receive another dollar of aid. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_REE1">Rice</persName> commented that he had
                            never heard or read of such a statement, and inquired what its source
                            was. General Van Fleet stated that it came from “American sources.”</p>
                        <pb n="586" xml:id="pg_586" facs="0622"/>
                        <p>Turning to the subject of Colonel <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim
                                Chong-p</persName>'il, Director of the Korean <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, General Van Fleet said that he was
                            indispensable to the Korean Government at the present time. He and
                            Chairman Pak continued to be very close, and were working together;
                            there was no real trouble within the regime. General Van Fleet had
                            talked to “Tiger” Song (General <persName corresp="#p_SY1">Song
                                Yo-ch</persName>'an, ex-Prime Minister), to <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim Chong-p</persName>'il and to Chairman Pak,
                            and had heard the views of each. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_REE1">Rice</persName> inquired whether the Chairman's and
                                <persName>Kim</persName>'s reports had agreed. The General said they
                            had. He continued that he had told both the Chairman and Colonel
                                <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim</persName> that
                                <persName>Kim</persName> should stay within his field, and not get
                            beyond it, as he had with the Walker Hill project (a foreign tourist
                            center) and the taxi import and assembly project. In the Walker Hill
                            case, however, Colonel <persName>Kim</persName> had been asked to
                            undertake it because he was the only man who could accomplish the
                            job.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_REE1">Rice</persName> asked about
                                <persName>Kim</persName>'s involvement in the stock market deal. The
                            General answered, first, that Colonel <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim</persName>'s involvement in it had never been proved; then,
                            that opposition forces had endeavored to use the stock market for
                            political fund-raising, against which countermeasures were necessary;
                            finally, that business optimism, coupled with the scarcity of
                            opportunities for investment, had forced the market up. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MDDS1">Macdonald</persName> commented that the power
                            available to the Korean Government should have enabled it to control the
                            market and avoid a speculative spiral, if it had wished.</p>
                        <p>General Van Fleet commented [<hi rend="italic">2 lines of source text not
                                declassified</hi>] that the U.S. military intelligence sources were
                            the best, and that we should look to them for information. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MDDS1">Macdonald</persName> stated that both the
                            Department and the Embassy in Seoul were receiving intelligence reports
                            from the Eighth Army; that these reports were very helpful; but that
                            they did not conflict in their general import with information from
                            other sources.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_REE1">Rice</persName> asked whether General Van
                            Fleet had given the Ambassador his views and observations on Korea, and
                            the General affirmed that he had done so.</p>
                        <p>General Van Fleet recalled his wartime experiences in Korea, when the
                            Korean military were very eager to have American guidance and American
                            approval. They would respond even to his unspoken thoughts—he would
                            think, for example, that a hill should be taken, and before he knew it,
                            it would be in <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> hands. Since then the
                            Koreans had matured; they wanted to do things for themselves, in their
                            own way; but they still wanted and needed American approval and
                            commendation when they did well. Of course, they sometimes acted rashly,
                            and made mistakes. The currency reform had been such a mistake.
                            Nevertheless, the Koreans had been quick to acknowledge their error, and
                            to correct it. Having done so, they expected our approval. We must
                            understand the <pb n="587" xml:id="pg_587" facs="0623"/>Koreans' nature
                            in our dealings with them. In this connection, it would be very
                            desirable for the United States to make an appropriate public statement
                            of our support. The Secretary, for example, might make a prepared
                            statement.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_REE1">Rice</persName> said that the United
                            States had already made clear its support. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MDDS1">Macdonald</persName> cited Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName>'s May 16 statement for the
                            Educational Radio Network,<note n="1" xml:id="d269fn1">Not further
                                identified.</note> and promised, at General Van Fleet's request, to
                            send him a copy. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_REE1">Rice</persName>
                            continued that he welcomed the General's strong partisan support of the
                            military government, commenting that it was a needed source of help for
                            the Koreans.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_REE1">Rice</persName> continued that he had
                            known Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName> and his
                            work for some years, and had every confidence in him. He hoped that
                            General Van Fleet, also, would cooperate with the Ambassador, give him
                            his confidence and keep him informed. General Van Fleet agreed, and
                            continued that while in Korea he had done his best to avoid creating
                            difficulties for the Ambassador. He himself, although by nature a modest
                            person, was willy-nilly a hero in Korea, and always received and treated
                            as one, though he never wanted it. He had sometimes felt that this must
                            make it difficult for the Ambassador.</p>
                        <p>The General wondered why Korea should have such a generally bad press in
                            the United States. He had commented on this point to some of his
                            friends, who agreed. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MDDS1">Macdonald</persName> stated that the many achievements of Korea
                            were unfortunately overshadowed by Korean crises, which appeared to be
                            more newsworthy. General Van Fleet mentioned that he had heard of an
                            American newspaper story that the level of U.S. economic aid to Korea
                            was to be reduced. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MDDS1">Macdonald</persName>
                            said there had been some speculative stories, but he had seen no such
                            report.</p>
                        <p>Turning to the question of military procurement in Korea, General Van
                            Fleet urged that U.S. purchases be increased, and that Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s recent order not
                            be allowed to affect procurement in Korea. He suggested that some
                            procurement now being made in Japan might be made in Korea, referring as
                            example to a suggestion by a U.S. military officer that trucks now being
                            bought in Japan ready to run could be purchased in stripped form and
                            assembled in Korea with Korean tires and batteries, which now are just
                            as good as American makes. The Japanese had already benefited enormously
                            by U.S. purchases there—for example, he himself had spent over $100
                            million in Japan for rehabilitating the Korean transportation system
                            (while he was in command in Korea). Korean suppliers to U.S. procurement
                            agencies were private firms, and loss of this business would be a
                            terrible blow to them.</p>
                        <pb n="588" xml:id="pg_588" facs="0624"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_REE1">Rice</persName> assured General Van Fleet
                            that he sympathized with this position and understood the prospective
                            adverse effects of the directive on Korea, but pointed out that the
                            directive had been issued in response to the need to redress the U.S.
                            balance of payments.</p>
                        <p>In concluding pleasantries, General Van Fleet said he would go to New
                            York to attend two directors' meetings—Twentieth Century Fox, in
                            connection with the possible ouster of Mr. Skouros, and Webb-Knapp, in

                        <p>1. Consistent with your request I have been looking into implications of
                            a redeployment of one of the US divisions in Korea. I discussed the
                            matter briefly with Admiral Felt during my trip last week with Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and I have informed
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName>, Eyes Only, of
                            our pending review.<note n="1" xml:id="d270fn1">Reference is to telegram
                                80 to Seoul, July 27, in which Weiss and Johnson informed <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName> that the principal presumed
                                advantages to the United States would be “increased tactical
                                flexibility” and “balance of payment savings” by stationing the
                                troops in a dollar area such as Okinawa. They stressed that they
                                appreciated the disadvantages of the proposal and reiterated that no
                                decision had been yet made. (Ibid., 795.00/7-2762)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. In pursuing this question I have found that the interagency committee
                            developing the report in response to <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                            Action 2447 (Review of the Military Aid Program)<note n="2" xml:id="d270fn2">See <ref target="#d251">Document 251</ref>.</note>
                            has moved rather far along in evolving proposals which relate to levels
                            of Korean forces and of US aid in relation thereto. Though <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Action 2447 is primarily addressed to
                            US Military Assistance and its problems, the Action does direct that the
                            review of <pb n="589" xml:id="pg_589" facs="0625"/>Korean Military
                            Assistance plans and programs should take into account and make
                            recommendations in connection with “the desirable level of US forces in
                            Korea.” This latter point has not been adequately addressed in the work
                            of the interagency committee developing the report in response to 2447.
                            The issue has largely been assumed away, i.e., that the importance of
                            the present levels of US forces in Korea is assumed to be manifest. The
                            study then focuses on levels of Korean forces and related aid problems.
                            Since <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Action 2447 is cast in terms
                            of a review of US foreign aid activities it is understandable why the
                            basic strategic policy implications surrounding the US force commitment
                            have not emerged clearly. As I see it, however, the preliminary
                            direction in which that Report is moving would severely prejudice any
                            serious consideration of a US force withdrawal since a large reduction
                            in Korean forces will probably be recommended.</p>
                        <p>3. As a result of the foregoing I propose to discuss this matter with
                                <persName corresp="#p_HF1">Fowler Hamilton</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Paul Nitze</persName> and Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> with a view to seeing how the
                            fundamental question which you raised, and which is explicitly raised by
                            the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Action 2447, can best be brought
                            into focus. I am also going to let <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge

                        <p>85. 1. We have been having rocky time here during past couple months, and
                            while situation is better in sense that new PriMin and Economic
                            Ministers are working with us in fairly cooperative fashion, I am still
                            not happy about certain aspects of situation.</p>
                        <p>2. Basic problem is power of <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim Chong
                                Pil</persName> and <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>. <persName>Kim</persName> was given
                            severe shaking and for few days in June and again in July it looked as
                            if his organization was going to be cut back to its basic intelligence
                            mission. Pak gave me assurances of this on two occasions, but there is
                            no sign this has been done.</p>
                        <pb n="590" xml:id="pg_590" facs="0626"/>
                        <p>3. <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> has curious set-up. One part devoted
                            to usual activities. Second part consists of political, economic,
                            legislative and public information divisions: which occupy themselves
                            with major policy matters. Numbers employed in latter are large; we have
                            no access to them; and some of their key people have record of past
                            Communist or leftist associations or hold extreme anti-American views.
                            Moreover <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> is in “everything”—appointments,
                            lodging their people in newspapers and business, deriving income from

                        <p>4. If Pak carries out his assurance to return <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> to its proper function, or if its

                            <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, we can then deal with <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim Chong Pil</persName> on a tidy basis. But
                            there is a real possibility that <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim Chong
                                Pil</persName> may continue in the same capacity with the same
                            all-embracing functions, in which case we will have serious problem of

                            resentment, frustration, and some bitterness [<hi rend="italic">2-1/2
                                lines of source text not declassified</hi>] at our refusal to accept
                            him as a major direct channel for communication with <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> on other matters. He said he wears
                            two hats which are completely separate, and we were to recognize this
                            and deal with him on all matters, for he is the real power and policy
                            maker in the government, and he is going to continue in that capacity.
                            He asked them to convey his desire for direct and regular contact with
                            me. He made it clear that anyone in or out of the mil govt who tries to
                            take his power away had better watch out, and that he is going to “get”
                            those on the Supreme Council who are trying to reduce his power. At same
                            time he went to some length to try to assure us that stability had been
                            reestablished at top leadership and contending factors had agreed work
                            together in furtherance revolutionary goals.</p>
                        <p>6. In two conversations with him, once with me in March and once with one
                            of our [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>] officers in July, he said that if it ever becomes
                            necessary to preserve the “revolution,” (i.e. preserve his power, which
                            he identifies with the revolution), he will do whatever is necessary,
                            including even “toppling” Pak Chong-hui.</p>
                        <p>7. We will be analyzing the implications of foregoing in separate
                                message.<note n="1" xml:id="d271fn1">Not further identified.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>8. Meantime we are picking up rumors that there is resentment in some
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Govt circles over my actions
                            during past couple months. One such rumor has it that <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim Chong Pil</persName> is out to get “certain
                            Americans.” Another, that some weeks ago Pak wrote Amb Chong Il-kwon to
                            arrange <pb n="591" xml:id="pg_591" facs="0627"/>for my recall.
                            According this rumor, Chong replied this was impossible and he would
                            resign if ordered to do so, after which Pak wrote back “to forget it.” I
                            cannot vouch for reliability latter rumor, but I believe that idea of
                            declaring me PNG has been considered. [<hi rend="italic">3 lines of
                                source text not declassified</hi>] However, a recent report has it
                            that some around Pak are anxious that close contact and good relations
                            be reestablished between him and me.</p>
                        <p>9. I should add that according reliable Korean source, Van Fleet made
                            deprecating remarks about me to Pak and <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim
                                Chong Pil</persName>, which has not helped matters, and I am

                        <p>1. Our problem with <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim
                                Chong-p'il</persName> and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
                            appears to Dept as crystallization more general problem we have all
                            foreseen: How effectively to counter trends toward totalitarian control
                            and ambitions of young colonels for political and personal power, and
                            how to keep Korea somewhere near road toward democratic development.</p>
                        <p>2. As you have pointed out, it is not realistic for us to insist on
                            full-blown democracy and complete disappearance of military leadership
                            in 1963. On other hand, continuing usefulness of Korea to us in terms
                            our long-range objectives depends upon maintenance of some forward
                            momentum toward evolution of free society. We can tolerate ups and
                            downs, but not major reversal.</p>
                        <p>3. Seems inescapable that we must be prepared accept either Pak Chong-hui
                            or man selected by him as Korea's leader for next few years, subject to
                            proviso that this leadership must be legitimated by people through
                            processes sufficiently free and fair to be acceptable in Korea and
                            world. Pak is only figure now in sight who seems to possess sufficient
                            intelligence, vision, breadth of contact, forcefulness, personal
                            reputation, <pb n="592" xml:id="pg_592" facs="0628"/>and access to power
                            (especially over military) to fulfill present leadership
                            requirements.</p>
                        <p>4. As you have recommended, we therefore should work with Pak,
                            manifesting our support for him implicitly rather than explicitly,
                            continuing to make clear that our support flows from our general policy
                            toward Korea and not from commitment to any individual or group, and
                            using our support for him as basis to influence his courses of action
                            along lines acceptable to us.</p>
                        <p>5. First course of action concerns <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim
                                Chong-p'il</persName>. Just as we should not support any individual
                            qua individual, we should not overtly so oppose anyone. However we can
                            make it clear, as you already have done, that a director of espionage
                            and secret police should not at same time be principal policy maker and
                            second-ranking leader of modern state, even in transition period; nor
                            should same man whose function it is to serve as watchdog over
                            government and society serve also as head of vast and uncontrolled
                            executive apparatus which is set above established governmental
                            apparatus and stifles it. Hence if <persName>Kim</persName> is to
                            continue run <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, he should head his
                            intelligence apparatus, make his recommendations, and limit himself to
                            those roles, leaving policy decision and execution to established
                            executive arm even when he believes his men might do it faster or
                            better. Alternatively, <persName>Kim</persName> might be removed from
                            picture gracefully, say as Ambassador to Japan where he seems to have
                            been so successful in negotiations. Pak might be reminded that principal
                            distinction between top leader and his associates is that former alone
                            exercises jurisdiction over all aspects of national affairs while
                            subordinates handle assigned parts. If this distinction is blurred,
                            status of leader is also blurred, and consequently his power. Hence
                            imperative that <persName>Kim</persName> accept his specialized
                            role.</p>
                        <p>6. As corollary to above, and as basis for continuity of revolution,
                            power and effectiveness of executive branch of government should be
                            enhanced, including greater role for Cabinet. This branch, with its
                            organization and personnel, has legitimacy of centuries of history,
                            constitutional sanction, and largely civilian staffing. It needs more
                            motivation, discipline, esprit de corps, and efficiency; but if it is
                            harassed and pushed aside by <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> and
                            military, it can never hope to improve; and if its work is to be taken
                            over by uncontrolled ad hoc organizations, these sooner or later will
                            fall prey to same weaknesses as present bureaucracy, as well as lacking
                            legitimacy and hence public acceptance. On other hand, if bureaucracy
                            can be strengthened, motivated, and brought to support revolutionary
                            objectives, it can be most powerful means of assuring continuation of
                            revolution under successor civilian government. Effective bureaucracy
                            with sense of pride, ideals, and esprit de corps can be much more immune
                            to undesirable political pressures than weak and underpaid organization
                            of past, and hence can be expected to remain on reasonable <pb n="593" xml:id="pg_593" facs="0629"/>course toward national development.
                            Extra-legal executive agencies, such as those under <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, should be either abolished or merged
                            into established government structure.</p>
                        <p>7. Second course of action concerns transition to civilian government.
                            Following propositions suggested for comment:</p>
                        <p>a. Eventual success of revolution depends upon consensus of Korean people
                            that its goals desirable and attainable; that revolutionary program
                            conceived and pursued for people's benefit, not that of junta alone or
                            its individual members; that government is led by men best equipped to
                            carry out this program; and that channels exist through which people can
                            express views, exert influence, and have sense participation.</p>
                        <p>b. This consensus can best be promoted by (1) protecting prestige and
                            reputation of military leaders as able, sincere men dedicated to
                            national welfare above all else; (2) legitimating government through
                            legitimate expression of popular will in referendum and elections; (3)
                            primary reliance on persuasion and firm leadership rather than terror;
                            (4) avoidance of unreasonable promises or unreasonable demands.</p>
                        <p>c. If revolutionary leaders are convinced that their goals and programs
                            are valid, and that Free World ideals they profess to support are valid,
                            then they should be willing accept challenges and risks of unrigged
                            elections.</p>
                        <p>d. On other hand, fraudulent election victory would negate everything
                            they stand for.</p>
                        <p>e. Such fundamental and far-reaching reforms as revolutionary leaders
                            envisage cannot be accomplished overnight, except in their most
                            superficial and least meaningful aspects; too much haste and pressure
                            will actually retard social and economic progress; hence long view is
                            essential, and setbacks are inevitable.</p>
                        <p>f. Korean people are basically sensible, pragmatic, independent-minded,
                            but suspicious of government; therefore if they are approached
                            sincerely, sensibly, and pragmatically, and if their suspicions thus in
                            some measure alleviated, they are most likely to support revolution at
                            polls, while trickery, bribery and pressure will do lasting damage
                            whatever statistical election outcome might be.</p>
                        <p>g. Best way of dealing with expectable opposition vote is to split it
                            among contending candidates rather than suppressing it. (This procedure
                            would also shed useful light on relative popularity of opposition
                            leaders.)</p>
                        <p>h. Progressive increase in freedom of action and expression as election
                            time approaches would be valuable demonstration of military leaders'
                            good faith. Removal additional individuals from political purification
                            lists, and termination martial courts and other emergency control
                            measures, would be useful this connection. Skillful public debate <pb n="594" xml:id="pg_594" facs="0630"/>on opposition political claims
                            and pronouncements, based on objectives, background, and experience of
                            military leaders with good public-relations counsel, could turn
                            increased freedom to leaders' advantage.</p>
                        <p>8. Third course of action concerns civilian participation, necessity of
                            which you have emphasized. Believe Pak should open channel of
                            communication with senior political leaders, inviting their suggestions,
                            and in course of dialogue on future of country, endeavor to gain support
                            of some of them by accepting at least portions of proferred advice, and
                            possibly by constituting an informal council of elder statesmen which
                            would have certain emoluments and status attached to it but would also
                            have degree of independence. Senior leaders' nominees might be given
                            Cabinet and sub-Cabinet positions as initial step in gaining their
                            confidence.</p>
                        <p>9. Fourth course of action concerns post-election control. Continuation
                            of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>-like apparatus in some form
                            probably inevitable, regardless of U.S. arguments pro or con, but
                            exclusive reliance must not be placed on it. Continued ties between
                            military and civilian bureaucracy, perhaps with latter protected through
                            some sort of civil service commission, plus plurality military
                            government members and supporters in national assembly and Pak or his
                            nominee as chief executive, backed by continued implicit power of armed
                            forces, should insure continuity of revolution. Another possibility
                            might be small legislative Upper House, half of whose members appointed
                            for first term of, say, six years, and other half subjected to
                            re-election after three years. Frank expression of military leadership's
                            influence through such means might be preferable to rigging of elections
                            for single legislation house.</p>
                        <p>10. You authorized approach Pak at appropriate time and in appropriate
                            circumstances and discuss situation along foregoing lines in context US
                            desire to be helpful, making above points as your own or as US
                            Government's as seems most expedient, and emphasizing that our concern
                            with specific problems or individuals, such as <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim Chong-p'il</persName>, is solely in context
                            our general concern with Korean security, progress, and prosperity,
                            which is in US interests as well as Korea's.</p>
                        <p>11. In regard your relations with military government, Dept continues to
                            have utmost confidence your ability to handle situation, and is prepared
                            to back you up in future as in past. Dept agrees with your policy of
                            refusing deal with <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim
                                Chong-p'il</persName> except on <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
                            matters, and not surprised that this policy, as well as your firmness on
                            other matters, has resulted in some back-pressure and bitterness. Dept
                            believes we are on right track and proposes we stay on it, having in
                            mind of course the need for the eager, sensitive, and by now somewhat
                            confused revolutionary leaders to have the sweet judiciously mingled
                            with the sour.</p>

                            cut-backs. This account costs a cool half billion a year in all forms of
                            aid; as such, it deserves a long hard look because many of us can think
                            of better ways to spend the last hundred million of this dough.</p>
                        <p>My sense is that <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>, State, and <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> are moving toward some form of force
                            and <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> cut. But this is such a
                            longstanding, contentious issue, and vested interests are so firmly
                            entrenched, that few are willing to bite the bullet. Moreover, I'm sure
                                <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName> will argue that
                            current political uncertainty in Korea militates against upsetting
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Army. He'd like at least to get
                            rid of <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim Chong-pil</persName> first.
                            However, my sense is that if we can offset force and <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> cut with promises of increased support
                            for Korean development, Pak regime might snap at this option, because
                            its political future depends largely on domestic record it makes.</p>

                        <p>DEAR <persName corresp="#p_DSP1">DEAN</persName>: As a result of a recent
                            meeting in <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Alexis Johnson</persName>'s
                                office<note n="1" xml:id="d274fn1">The meeting took place on August
                                2. According to a memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, August 24, Department of Defense officials
                                were asked at this meeting to examine the possibilities of
                                redeploying a division from Korea to Okinawa. The idea had been
                                raised twice by <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> who
                                anticipated it would result in greater military flexibility and
                                balance-of-payments relief. According to the memorandum, “Mr.
                                    <persName>Johnson</persName> suggested that from the standpoint
                                of Communist intentions, one division should be sufficient to serve
                                as a ‘plate glass’ and thus deter another attack. He presumed that
                                sizeable savings of foreign exchange could be realized by shifting a
                                division to a ‘dollar area’; and that these ‘savings’ would reduce
                                the need for cutting <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces.”

                        </p>
                        <p>Based on the following conclusions, the Chiefs believe that the
                            redeployment of one division would not be in consonance with U.S.
                            interests:</p>
                        <p>a. Removal of a division not only would dilute our present deterrent to
                            Communist aggression in Korea to an unacceptable level but could lead to
                            an undesirable change in U.S./<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            command relationship. It would also result in <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> reluctance to continue U.S. operational control of
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces.</p>
                        <p>b. Combat capability in Korea would be reduced without proportional
                            increase in the general Pacific area.</p>
                        <p>c. In view of the limited airfield and port facilities in Okinawa,
                            redeployment could result in a decrease in flexibility of forces.</p>
                        <p>d. Redeployment would require an additional one-time expenditure ranging
                            from an order of magnitude of $87 million without dependents in Okinawa,
                            to $138 million with dependents.</p>
                        <p>e. The acquisition of the additional land which would be required in
                            Okinawa would be extremely difficult in view of the attendant political
                            implications.</p>
                        <p>f. Transportation resources presently available in the Pacific Command
                            would not support an immediate redeployment of a division from Okinawa
                            to Korea during the initial phases of hostilities.</p>
                        <p>g. Redeployment of a division to Okinawa, vis-a-vis having it in Korea,
                            would affect the international balance of payments adversely by <pb n="597" xml:id="pg_597" facs="0633"/>approximately $1.1 million
                            annually. This results from the fact that only some $9.3 million of the
                            costs, including pay and allowances, of maintaining a division in Korea
                            enter the balance of payments account each year, whereas the loss of
                            dollars involved in maintaining a division in Okinawa would amount to
                            approximately $10.4 million, because of the close association between
                            the Okinawan and Japanese economies.</p>
                        <p>In addition to these views, we have had the benefit of several other
                            studies conducted recently in <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DoD</gloss> by
                            special study groups regarding the situation in this area and the forces
                            required to cope successfully with the several major contingencies.
                            These studies generally agree that, while present forces in Korea are
                            fully capable of inflicting a decisive defeat against North Korean
                            forces alone, a combined North Korean ChiCom attack would present a
                            quite serious challenge to the ability of these forces to defend South
                            Korea. Obviously, the gravity of this threat and the managing of a
                            successful defense depend upon such critical elements as length of
                            warning time, availability of bases in Japan, and events in other areas
                            of the world, as well as the size and readiness of the defending
                            forces.</p>
                        <p>In view of these considerations and the fact that no decision has yet
                            been taken on the optimum balance between our economic and military
                            assistance programs in Korea, we are not prepared at this time to
                            recommend the withdrawal of one U.S. division from Korea.<note n="3" xml:id="d274fn3">At the White House staff meeting on September 13,
                                this letter was discussed as follows: “The Secretary of Defense has
                                sent a letter to the Secretary of State stating that this is not a
                                good time to cut down US forces in Korea. We have to keep three
                                divisions in the Far East, and shifting the one from Korea to
                                Okinawa would cost more gold as well as being very difficult to do
                                politically. As far as the White House is concerned, this point is
                                settled. Now comes the question of settling on a Korean force
                                reduction, which has been agreed to a certain extent, but <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> reports that Defense is

                            developments over the next few months.</p>
                        <p>Conclusions</p>
                        <p>A. The recent outbreak of factional strife within the military junta
                            which rules South Korea has been caused largely by controversy [<hi rend="italic">5 lines of source text not declassified</hi>]. We
                            believe that the junta, with General Pak Chong-hui as the key figure,
                            will remain in power until the elections scheduled for 1963, and will
                            exercise a large degree of control over the new civilian government.
                            (Paras. 1-5, 9-12)</p>
                        <p>B. The junta currently has little popular support. Blatantly rigged
                            elections or further economic deterioration could cause riots and
                            demonstrations. While the regime can suppress local outbursts, massive
                            public demonstrations could trigger coup attempts by disgruntled
                            military leaders, perhaps acting in concert with presently disbarred
                            political elements. The outcome of such attempts cannot be estimated,
                            but the government which emerged from such a situation would almost
                            certainly require a large degree of backing from the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> military. (Paras. 6-8, 11)</p>
                        <p>C. <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>-US relations will continue to be
                            difficult over the next few months. There will probably be some attempts
                            to improve liaison with US officials in economic matters, although the
                            CIA will continue its largely uncontrolled economic activities. In
                            political matters, it is doubtful that either Pak or
                                <persName>Kim</persName> will accept US suggestions which might
                            impose limitations on their actions. Despite strong US pressures, it is
                            doubtful that the issue of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>-Japanese
                            relations will soon be resolved. Only on the military plane will <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>-US relations remain reasonably open and
                            friendly. (Paras. 13-17)</p>
                        <p>D. Factional strife within the junta, increased public apathy and even
                            hostility toward the regime, and strained relations with the US have <pb n="599" xml:id="pg_599" facs="0635"/>increased the danger of
                            Communist subversive activities. Appeals to Korean nationalism and for
                            peaceful unification may prove more effective than in the past. During
                            the next few months, a real Communist threat to the regime is unlikely
                            to develop, but if the political erosion, which has already commenced,
                            is not halted and if economic stagnation persists, the problem of
                            countering Communist subversion will become far more serious. (Paras.
                            18-20)</p>

                        <p>I have examined the question of withdrawing a U.S. division from Korea as
                            a means of increasing the flexibility of our military posture in the
                            Western Pacific. Although the withdrawal of one division would probably
                            not materially dilute the deterrent effect of the presence of U.S.
                            forces, there are a number of negative considerations.</p>
                        <p>It appears that proximity to Korea is important in light of a finding by
                            the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> that in the event of a combined
                            North Korean-ChiCom attack, the presence of two U.S. divisions would be
                            necessary at the outset. Thus, Okinawa would provide the best alternate
                            location for the division. Hawaii and the Philippines are both
                            comparatively distant. Difficulties with this alternative are a) the
                            present lack of sufficient transportation in the opening days of a
                            conflict, and b) the lack of sufficient airfield and port facilities in
                            Okinawa rapidly to effect the movement of the necessary size.</p>
                        <p>In addition, there are also a number of disadvantages of a political and
                            economic nature. Such a withdrawal would likely have an unsettling
                            effect on the Korean Government in its present stage of development <pb n="600" xml:id="pg_600" facs="0636"/>and might trigger a demand by
                            the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s for a change in command
                            relationships which we would find unacceptable. It would militate
                            against carrying out the reduction in <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Army force levels which we are presently contemplating
                            as a means of increasing the availability of local resources for
                            economic development purposes. The concomitant loss of the 9.3 million
                            dollars which accrues to Korea by virtue of the presence of a division
                            would be equivalent to reducing Korea's export level by about 22.7 per
                            cent. Accordingly, an increase in supporting assistance would be
                            required, a doubtful possibility at best.</p>
                        <p>Acquisition of the necessary additional land in Okinawa (with 1539
                            persons per square mile already one of the most densely populated areas
                            in the world) would likely produce political repercussions which might
                            militate against continued U.S. use of that vital base.</p>
                        <p>In light of these arguments it would appear inadvisable to withdraw a
                            U.S. division from Korea at this time.</p>

                        <p>In studying the economic/political problems and programs for South Korea,
                            one is impressed with the conflicting factors which enter into a
                            consideration of these matters. The following is a list of some of the
                            things we would like to accomplish, yet which obviously can not be done
                            at the same time and without mutual conflict.</p>
                        <p>a. Effect a significant reduction in military spending in order to
                            improve the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> economy and, in so
                            doing, to stabilize the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> military
                            budget.</p>
                        <p>b. Make the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Government pay its own
                            way to a greater degree, particularly in meeting the military costs of
                            soft goods (<gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> transfer).</p>
                        <p>c. Restrain the gold dollar outflow.</p>
                        <p>d. Anticipate the effects of a large cut in foreign aid by Congress.</p>
                        <p>e. Increase the size of <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss>'s
                            general reserve, possibly from forces in Korea.</p>
                        <p>f. Retain the confidence and friendship of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s—particularly of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> military.</p>
                        <p>g. Retain operational control of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            military forces under the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> banner.</p>
                        <p>h. Do all of the foregoing without running undue military risks.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. New Approach</p>
                        <p>To bring some order into this chaos of conflicting desiderata, we need to
                            review from the beginning the goals of U.S. policy in South Korea. As a
                            point of departure, we should begin with the fact that we must first
                            meet the hard requirements of adequate defense before concerning
                            ourselves with other things no matter how attractive and desirable. It
                            is essential to be able to defend the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> economy before building <pb n="602" xml:id="pg_602" facs="0638"/>it into a lucrative, vulnerable target for Communist
                            military aggression. After meeting the indispensable requirements of
                            security, we are then ready to take those actions which will be most
                            helpful to the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> economy at least cost
                            to the U.S., particularly in gold.</p>

                        <p>At the present time, and for several years until the effect of
                            considerable additional <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> expenditures
                            can be felt, this war plan would be implemented in the face of a greatly
                            superior enemy air force. It is not difficult to visualize a surprise
                            1,000 plane air attack by the North Korean-ChiCom air forces on South
                            Korean targets at the outset of hostilities, resulting in great damage
                            to the S. Korean air defense system, the concentrated logistic
                            facilities, and the ports and airfields necessary to receive the planned
                            augmentation from outside Korea. Until some solution to the air defense
                            problem is found, the successful execution of the war plan is
                            doubtful—without any of the cuts in money and manpower discussed in the
                            following paragraph.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">4. Supporting Military Assistance Program</p>
                        <p>The 5-year <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> program recommended by
                            General <persName corresp="#p_MGGS1">Meloy</persName>, Admiral <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName> and <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> (600,000 strength—$250 million a year <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> and 21 billion won—defense budget)—is
                            designed to support the foregoing war plan. Particularly important to
                            the <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> program are those measures to
                            overcome the weaknesses in air defense mentioned above. They include an
                            improved <gloss target="#t_ACW2">AC&amp;W</gloss> capability, the
                            introduction of the F104G AW interceptor to replace the F86D, more
                                <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss> missiles (but not launchers),
                            more air fields capable of receiving augmentation aircraft and possibly
                            the F5A tactical fighter to replace the F86F. Deferment is possible in
                            the F5A program as the F86F can still play a useful role in ground
                            support.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">5. Reduced <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>
                            Program</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador's proposal to set a ceiling on the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> won defense budget would predictably result in a
                            reduction of the <gloss target="#t_ROKAF1">ROKAF</gloss> by 70,000 in
                            the next two years. However, he does not recommend any decrease in the
                                <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> program, because of the agreed
                            Country Team position that any personnel reduction should be in part
                            compensated by improvement of the remaining forces. As a separate
                            matter, there are independent Washington proposals for reduced <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> programs which, regardless of the
                            outcome of the Ambassador's proposals with respect to the won budget,
                            would similarly result in reduction of the ROKAF. Two such programs are
                            now being considered. One sets an annual <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> ceiling at $225 million and the other at $180 million.
                            In both cases, the manpower cut would accomplish very little
                            savings—about $9 million a year in the won defense budget and $10
                            million a year in annual <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>
                            maintenance. The <pb n="603" xml:id="pg_603" facs="0639"/>military
                            effect would be a reduction of 4-5 <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            division equivalents if applied over a 2-year period and the serious
                            diminution of the initial ground strength and logistical back-up
                            necessary to execute the war plan. Any chance for ultimate success in
                            the situation contemplated, i.e., massive North Korean-ChiCom
                            conventional attack, would require a compensating increase in
                            augmentation forces brought into Korea under hostile air attack which
                            would make such augmentation slow and costly.</p>
                        <p>A <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> cut to $225 million would retard
                            modernization of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces undesirably,
                            particularly in the fighter-interceptor program and would weaken
                            logistical capabilities. However, the dollar cut in itself would not
                            seriously affect the ability to execute the war plan.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, a cut to $180 million would fail to fund about 48% of
                            the force improvements and make impossible the correction of the
                            weakness in air defense. If such a reduction of <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> were decided, it would be necessary to overhaul
                            completely the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> force structure and
                            to make a new war plan consistent with this reduced force.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">6. Interim Conclusions</p>
                        <p>a. One reaches the conclusion that any large personnel cut is
                            unproductive of savings which would justify weakening the defense
                            posture and incurring the political and psychological problems which
                            such proposals would create with the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s. Further, we should recognize that if we cut <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> manpower, the US force strength in
                            Korea is nailed down for the indefinite future. If, in spite of these
                            considerations, a large force cut is imposed we must change the concept
                            of the war plan and the objectives of the <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> program.</p>
                        <p>b. Some dollar reduction in <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> may be
                            accepted by way of stretchout and deferrals. However, air defense
                            modernization is so important that most of it—certainly the AC&amp;W
                            and F104G parts—should be fully funded. My feeling is that $225 million
                            is about the minimum figure to consider for reducing <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>c. The stabilization of the won defense budget is a desirable objective
                            but should be defined in terms of % of <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss> rather than as a fixed ceiling. This is an inflationary
                            economy and defense costs seem certain to rise.</p>
                        <p>d. While a withdrawal of US forces would offer the possibility of
                            improving <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss>'s strategic
                            posture, it would be hard to find a location for their redeployment in
                            the Pacific. Their withdrawal would offer some reduction of the gold
                            outflow in Korea but this might be offset by the need of greater dollar
                            aid on the economic side to compensate for the dollars lost by the
                            reduction of U.S. forces.</p>
                        <pb n="604" xml:id="pg_604" facs="0640"/>
                        <p>e. No real savings in Korean manpower and/or <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> can be achieved without changing one or more of the
                            following basic factors:</p>
                        <p>The mission of forces in Korea.</p>
                        <p>The assumption with regard to the use of nuclear weapons.</p>
                        <p>The availability of space in <gloss target="#t_PACOM1">PACOM</gloss> for
                            the redeployment of US forces from Korea.</p>
                        <p>The assumption as to availability of new and advanced weapons for
                            Korea.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">7. Possible Effect of Changing Basic Factors</p>
                        <p>Let us take the following assumptions and then consider the effect on
                            military plans and programs:</p>
                        <p>New Assumptions:</p>
                        <p>a. The mission of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces in Korea is to defeat without
                            the use of nuclear weapons any aggression by N. Korean forces.</p>
                        <p>b. [<hi rend="italic">3 lines of source text not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>c. Space can be found for a U.S. division force in the Philippines, Guam
                            or Okinawa, singly or in combination.</p>
                        <p>The effect of these assumptions would permit the change of the Korean
                            force requirements along the following lines:</p>
                        <p>a. The Korean active armed forces could be safely reduced to some figure
                            safely above the N. Korean strength of about 350,000 of which a
                            significant number of Army units are tied down to coast defense
                            missions. Obsolescent equipment made excess by this reduction could be
                            stored for use by <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> reserve
                            divisions.</p>
                        <p>b. Other forms of force modernization would continue at presently planned
                            levels. The Air Defense component about as presently planned in the $250
                            million <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> program would still be
                            required.</p>
                        <p>c. The <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> program would be reduced to
                            conform to the requirements of the new force structure.</p>
                        <p>d. US Army forces in Korea could be reduced to a Task Force of about one
                            division [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>] (eventually to include the Pershing missile). In
                            the period prior to receiving Pershing, the surface-to-surface
                            capability of Nike Hercules would be fully exploited. The U.S. troops
                            withdrawn from Korea would be redeployed to <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> reserve and stationed in the Western Pacific.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">8. Alternatives</p>
                        <p>In summary, we are presented with these alternatives:</p>
                        <p>a. Stay with present assumptions, plans and programs essentially as
                            recommended (600,000—$250 million).</p>
                        <p>b. Revise assumptions and restate missions along lines suggested in
                            paragraph 7. Then reevaluate requirements and reshape the MA and <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> programs.</p>
                        <p>c. Put out diplomatic feelers to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to see if there is a possibility of normalizing
                            North-South relationships in Korea, at least to point of easing the

                            course can be undertaken concurrently with either of the other
                            alternatives.</p>

                        <p>You may wish to take advantage of the opportunity raised by General
                                <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>'s concise statement
                            of the issue of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> force cuts in
                            paragraph B of his cable. The <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> has
                            been, as you know, strongly opposed to any consideration of such cuts on
                            the grounds that the joint U.S.-<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            mission in Korea is to defend against a combined North Korean-ChiCom
                            assault against the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>It seems to me that such a contingency, if it occurred would raise a
                            question which would go far beyond what we faced in Korea in 1950. If
                            this is true, should we not re-examine our very expensive commitments in
                            Korea to see if they still are based on realistic contingencies.</p>
                        <p>You might wish, for example, to ask the Joint Chiefs to examine what size
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> force would be necessary to hold
                            South Korea against a non-nuclear <pb n="606" xml:id="pg_606" facs="0642"/>attack by North Korean forces alone. Then they might
                            consider what other military dispositions we might make both in Korea
                            and outside it to deter the ChiComs from assisting the Koreans in such
                            an attack.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>I confess to a twinge as I heard the discussion, but on reflection it
                            comes out this way:</p>
                        <p>(1) I may have misunderstood General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>, but I see no real difference between our
                            strategic posture in Europe and that in <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss>. In either case we resist conventionally unless and
                            until confronted with an overwhelming attack. To me, all-out ChiCom
                            attack at outset would be comparable to all-out Soviet attack in Europe.
                                [<hi rend="italic">1 line of source text not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>[<hi rend="italic">5-1/2 lines of source text not declassified</hi>]
                            Remember it was threat of nuclear escalation which led to Korean
                            armistice.</p>
                        <p>(3) [<hi rend="italic">2-1/2 lines of source text not declassified</hi>]
                            This, together with US “tripwire” also there, is real deterrent which
                            makes attack on Korea seem so poor a bet to Peiping. Thus the only
                            circumstances under which the ChiComs would think of attacking would be
                            firm conviction that we wouldn't end up using [<hi rend="italic">less
                                than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>]. Cutting 6-8
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> divisions wouldn't basically
                            change this equation; indeed, it would only underline it more.</p>
                        <p>(4) Indeed we have a greater combination of deterrents against local
                            aggression in Korea than anywhere else around the Bloc perimeter—not
                            just the above but two plus US divisions, 19 <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> divisions, <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> command
                            and umbrella of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolutions, 10 mile
                            demilitarized zone.</p>
                        <pb n="607" xml:id="pg_607" facs="0643"/>
                        <p>(5) Ergo, direct ChiCom attack on the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            is the least likely of all cases. There has never been a direct Soviet
                            or ChiCom local aggression. Even the one overt Communist local attack in
                            the whole postwar period was an attack by proxy (North Korean).</p>
                        <p>(6) For all these reasons, I've never understood why we've tied up so
                            much of our <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> (and US) assets in
                            Korea. We are militarily over-insured in this area, by comparison to
                            SEA, Middle East, even Europe. Why did we ever spend so much on <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces in 1953-62 instead of shoring up
                            SEA more?</p>
                        <p>(7) As <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> so cogently says,
                            we're betwixt and between in Korea. We have a lot more than is needed to
                            stop <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss>s conventionally, but not enough
                            to do more than delay a massive ChiCom attack without either (a)
                            mounting an even bigger Korean War style effort; or (b) [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                            declassified</hi>]. So who are we kidding?</p>
                        <p>(8) Finally, I can't envisage the truly massive ChiCom buildup needed for
                            attack occurring without lots of warning. We knew when ChiComs left
                            Korea in 1956-59. We should be able to find out easily if 600,000 came
                            back.</p>
                        <p>Thus to change the mission of the US/<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            forces in Korea would be essentially a bookkeeping transaction. It would
                            not significantly lower the existing [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line
                                of source text not declassified</hi>] threshold. It would not
                            significantly increase the [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source
                                text not declassified</hi>] risks. It would only make somewhat more
                            explicit what is implicit now, i.e. if the almost inconceivable happened
                            and the ChiComs launched a direct attack, we would have to decide
                            whether to use [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>] at some point. Since we have that capability now
                            (and presumably have contingency plans for its use), I see no new policy
                                issue.<note n="2" xml:id="d279fn2">In an October 4 memorandum to

                        <p>Therefore, I see no need for President, in authorizing change in

                        <p>The Ambassador and I talked for fifteen or twenty minutes while he was
                            waiting to see the President. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NCA1">Norred</persName>, the Korean desk officer, was with us.</p>
                        <p>I raised the question of the possibility of reducing the size of the
                            Korean army and transferring more resources to economic development. He
                            agreed it would be desirable, if there was some way of doing it without
                            increasing unemployment and if we in fact did sustain the total level of
                            aid and transferred more for economic purposes. This much of the

                            directly with <persName>Kim</persName> to indicate the value we place on

                        <p>After an exchange of courtesies, Ambassador Chung raised the question of
                            whether or not our interest in the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>-Japanese settlement presaged a reduction of U.S.
                            commitments and an attempt to shift the responsibility to Japan.</p>
                        <p>The President assured the Ambassador that this was not the case. He said
                            that the Korean economic problems were so great that Korea needed all
                            the assistance that the U.S. and Japan could provide. Our hope was that
                            Japan could play her part in addition to what the U.S. was able to
                            furnish. Further, the President noted that the Japanese were in no sense
                            prepared to take over our military commitments, and we had every
                            intention of maintaining them. He urged the Ambassador to repeat these
                            reassurances to Chairman Park.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Chung showed the President some figures concerning present
                            North Korean production levels in steel, cement, electric power and
                            fertilizer, with South Korea goals for 1966, and pointed out the
                            population discrepancies between the two parts of the country as
                            well.</p>
                        <p>The President then handed Ambassador Chung his response to General Park's
                                letter<note n="1" xml:id="d281fn1"> Pak's September 12 letter

                        <p>The Secretary remarked that Director <persName>Kim</persName> found the
                            Department preoccupied with a major crisis.<note n="1" xml:id="d282fn1">The Cuban missile crisis.</note> The Secretary asked whether Mr.
                                <persName>Kim</persName> saw any signs of significant activity in
                            North Korea. Mr. <persName>Kim</persName> replied that he did not. He
                            expressed his appreciation for the Secretary's giving his time at a time
                            when he is so busy.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he would like to speak first on the possibility of a
                            Japanese-Korean settlement. He said that it would be helpful to both
                            countries to resolve their problems and establish normal political,
                            economic and military relations. The Secretary said he understood that
                            Mr. <persName>Kim</persName> had stopped in Tokyo on his way to the U.S.
                            and that as a result of his talks there, there is some gleam of hope
                            that a settlement can be reached.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Kim</persName> said that he met with Foreign Minister Ohira
                            for two hours and with Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> for 2-3/4 hours. His purpose in meeting the
                            Japanese leaders was to create a better atmosphere for the negotiations
                            which have been underway in Tokyo. His discussions with <persName corresp="#p_OM1">Ohira</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> concentrated on claims, fisheries, the peace line,
                            and Tokto Island. The status of Korean residents and art treasures was
                            also mentioned, but, Director <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim</persName> said, these were “small matters.”</p>
                        <p>Concerning claims, Mr. <persName>Kim</persName> said that Ohira mentioned
                            payment of $300 million over 12 years in installments of $25 million per
                            year. <persName>Kim</persName> told <persName corresp="#p_OM1">Ohira</persName> that $300 million is not sufficient and that 12
                            years is too long. He said that he hoped for something more than $300
                            million plus loans which would bring the total to $600 million.
                                <persName>Kim</persName> said that <persName corresp="#p_OM1">Ohira</persName> explained that even $300 million was only his own
                            opinion and had not been discussed with <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_OM1">Ohira</persName> also
                            told <persName>Kim</persName> that annual payments to <pb n="611" xml:id="pg_611" facs="0647"/>Korea could not exceed the $25 million
                            paid annually under the reparations agreement with the Philippines.
                                <persName corresp="#p_OM1">Ohira</persName> noted that Japan pays a
                            total of $80 million per year for reparations. <persName>Kim</persName>
                            said that Ohira also remarked that it was unrealistic to discuss a $600
                            million ceiling. He asked <persName>Kim</persName> to be more flexible
                            about loans. <persName>Kim</persName> said that he replied that, in view
                            of the anti-Japanese feeling among the Korean people fostered by the
                            Rhee regime, $600 million was the least that could be accepted.</p>
                        <p>According to <persName>Kim</persName>, in concluding the talks <persName corresp="#p_OM1">Ohira</persName> said that the amount could be $300
                            million but could not be called reparations. He suggested that the
                            payment be described as “congratulatory in recognition of Korean
                            independence.” <persName>Kim</persName> said that he replied again that
                            $300 million would not be sufficient. The total must be $600 million
                            including more than $300 for reparations with the remainder being made
                            up of loans. Concerning what the non-loan portion would be called,
                                <persName>Kim</persName> said he told Ohira that he would not insist
                            on the term “reparations” so long as it was clear to the Korean public
                            that the total included reparations. <persName>Kim</persName> said that
                            he would refer the question to his Government.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he hoped that both sides would carefully study the
                            problem. We have strongly urged both Korea and Japan to make the
                            strongest possible effort. We believe that a settlement is of the
                            highest importance to both countries and, therefore, to the U.S. Mr.
                                <persName>Kim</persName> indicated that he would meet again with
                            Ohira on his way back to Korea.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that his experience of the past two weeks, during
                            which he has dealt with a dangerous problem involving governments that
                            are not friends, has made problems between friends appear simple. In his
                            present state of mind, he would simply urge both sides: agree, agree,
                            agree.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Kim</persName> said he would like next to report on the
                            peace line and fisheries. In his recent Tokyo talks, he said, he asked
                            the Japanese not to be so sensitive about the peace line and to deal
                            with it separately from the fisheries question. He pointed out that the
                            line is directed at the Communists, not the Japanese. He also pointed
                            out that the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> is in a state of war
                            and that 200 attempted infiltrations occurred last year. On fisheries,
                            he suggested to the Japanese that an agreement beneficial to both sides
                            be negotiated. He intended to be flexible and asked the Japanese to be
                            flexible also.</p>
                        <p>Concerning Tokto Island, Mr. <persName>Kim</persName> said that this
                            question was only recently introduced into the negotiations by the
                            Japanese. In his recent talks in Tokyo, he urged that this question be
                            put off until after a general settlement is reached.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked what the island is used for. Mr.
                                <persName>Kim</persName> replied that it is “a place for sea gull
                            droppings.” He suggested to the Japanese that it be blown up. The
                            Secretary commented that this solution had also occurred to him. Mr.
                                <persName>Kim</persName> indicated that Ohira had apparently not
                            been <pb n="612" xml:id="pg_612" facs="0648"/>amused by this suggestion
                            but replied that the Socialists would attack him on the issue.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Kim</persName> said that his talk with Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> revealed a somewhat
                            different Japanese position on claims. <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> offered $150 million for claims.
                                <persName>Kim</persName> said that when he told <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> that the Foreign Minister had
                            spoken of $300 million, <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> had
                            replied that this was a matter he would settle, not the Foreign
                            Minister. <persName>Kim</persName> said that in response to his
                            questions, <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> told him that the
                            $150 million figure is not rigid, that loans above the $150 million
                            claims payment could bring the total to about $600 million, and that
                            these loans could be from government to government at very low interest
                            rates. <persName>Kim</persName> said that <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> agreed with his approach to the peace line and
                            fisheries questions.</p>
                        <p><persName>Kim</persName> said that <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> confirmed <persName corresp="#p_OM1">Ohira</persName>'s statement that Japanese-Korean political talks
                            could be held by the end of 1962 and that an agreement could be signed
                            next spring and ratified by the Japanese Diet in June or July.</p>
                        <p>On Tokto Island, <persName>Kim</persName> asked Ikeda whether referral to
                            the International Court of Justice was the only solution seen by the
                            Japanese. Ikeda indicated that possibly the matter could be delayed
                            until after public interest had died down.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary commented that he would gather from
                                <persName>Kim</persName>'s report that some possibility of agreement
                            exists. <persName>Kim</persName> replied that he would do his best to
                            promote an early settlement when he stops in Tokyo on his way home.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary referred to the coming elections in South Korea and
                            expressed the hope that these elections would give the Korean people a
                            sense of real partnership in their government. <persName>Kim</persName>
                            assured the Secretary that the Korean Government will do its best to
                            have fair and just elections and would open the way more and more to
                            public participation in public affairs. He questioned, however, whether
                            it will be possible to move to a completely democratic government by
                            next year.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that we will be in touch further with the Korean
                            authorities on these questions through Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName>. He asked Mr.
                                <persName>Kim</persName> to convey his personal greetings to
                            Chairman Pak.</p>

                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> took Director
                                <persName>Kim</persName> to his office to continue discussions after
                            conclusion of <persName>Kim</persName>'s call on the Secretary.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> said that the
                            Secretary had spoken of plans for the elections in South Korea. The
                            Governor commented that these elections can make a great difference in
                            the confidence of the Korean people.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Kim</persName> asked in what respect Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> is particularly concerned
                            about the elections. The Governor replied that he is concerned over the
                            restriction of candidates. Mr. <persName>Kim</persName> said that the
                            Korean authorities are not going to apply restrictions beyond those in
                            the political purification law, but candidates will not be allowed to
                            run as independents. They must run as members of a political party
                            because in the past independents have been corrupt and easily bought. In
                            response to Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>'s
                            question, Mr. <persName>Kim</persName> said that all parties except the
                            Communists and “socialistic elements” will be allowed to put up
                            candidates.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> said that we
                            greatly respect the determination of the Korean leaders to eliminate
                            corruption but that political freedom is quite another matter. Mr.
                                <persName>Kim</persName> said that it is necessary to avoid
                            recurrence of the old evils that would threaten stability of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> and might block further progress toward
                            freedom. The Korean Government however intends to develop a sound party
                            system. Government and opposition parties will be given an equal
                            chance.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> asked how soon
                            free political discussion is to be permitted. Mr.
                                <persName>Kim</persName> answered this will be done at the beginning
                            of 1963, thereby providing five to five and one half months of free
                            discussion before the elections.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> asked how many
                            politicians on the proscribed list have been taken off. Mr.
                                <persName>Kim</persName> replied that over 4,000 persons were listed
                            at first. Between 2600 or 2700 remain on the list. More are to be taken
                            off.</p>

                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> asked Mr.
                                <persName>Kim</persName> about his talks at the Pentagon. Mr.
                                <persName>Kim</persName> replied that he had seen a number of
                            people, including Deputy Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BWP1">Bundy</persName> and Generals Wheeler, Fitch, Breitweiser, Carroll

                                discussions with <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt Rostow</persName>,
                                Counselor and Chairman of the Policy Planning Staff. The first
                                discussion dealt with problems of generating economic development
                                and the second with how a military dictatorship disengages and moves
                                a nation into a democracy. (Memorandum of conversation, October 28;
                                ibid., 033.95B11/10-2862)</note> He said that some of the
                            discussions had been heated. Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> asked whether Mr. <persName>Kim</persName>
                            wanted to maintain armed forces at 600,000. Mr. <persName>Kim</persName>
                            replied “at least that large.” Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> asked how long this would be necessary. Mr
                                <persName>Kim</persName> replied “until we have driven the
                            Communists out.” Mr. <persName>Kim</persName> noted that former Premier
                            Chang Myon had reduced the forces by 30,000 men. He described this
                            action as a complete failure. The economy had not been helped.
                            Unemployment had been increased.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> asked about the
                            civic action program. Mr. <persName>Kim</persName> said that this
                            program is very active. In the past it suffered from diversion of
                            military supplies but this has been stopped. He said that good results
                            have been obtained in training soldiers before their discharge in skills
                            that they can use when they return home.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> asked Mr.
                                <persName>Kim</persName> what activity he saw in the North Korean
                            military. Mr. <persName>Kim</persName> recalled that he had told the
                            Secretary that he had seen no significant North Korean activity because
                            he understood the Secretary's question to refer to activity in response
                            to the Cuban crisis. Mr. <persName>Kim</persName> said that there has
                            been a significant development, however. A combined North Korean-Chinese
                            Communist headquarters has been established. Also, the number of Chinese
                            advisers in all fields: military, political and industrial has
                            increased. There are more Chinese advisers than Russian advisers.
                            Russian influence is declining and Chinese influence is increasing.</p>
                        <p>In response to Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>'s
                            question concerning conditions in North Korea, Mr.
                                <persName>Kim</persName> said that although people there get enough
                            to eat, life is miserable beyond description because of the lack of
                            freedom. North Korea, however, is superior to South Korea in many
                            economic fields. Mr. <persName>Kim</persName> commented that this is why
                            the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> is trying to advance in all
                            economic fields. Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> said that we are very anxious that the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> industrial program succeed. Mr.
                                <persName>Kim</persName> said that the Korean Government is
                            determined to do all it can to develop basic industry quickly.</p>

                        <p>The political process precedent to the establishment of an elected
                            government under a revised constitution is getting underway in Korea.
                            From now until the seating of a successor government in mid-summer 1963,
                            political activity and elections will dominate the local scene.</p>
                        <p>The military government has been planning the transition with great care
                            and attention to detail, seeking to ensure the perpetuation of power in
                            the hands of those who made the revolution of May 16, 1961. To succeed
                            they intend to secure the election of Pak Chong-hui as President and
                            majority control of the National Assembly. Government plans include
                            banning political activity by major ex-political leaders, certain
                            restrictions on political party organizations, and constitutional
                            provisions favoring government objectives. The government political
                            party to be formed will be aided also by the natural advantages of a
                            government in power, plentiful financial resources, a head-start in
                            organization, and the absence of a cohesive opposition. We can expect a
                            cleverly managed election rather than a crudely rigged one. Strong
                            leadership within the junta is being exercised by <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim Chong-p'il</persName> with the support of Pak
                            Chong-hui. <persName>Kim</persName>'s power continues in the ascendancy,
                            resting on good organization, dedication, great ambition and an
                            extensive police network.</p>
                        <p>Opposition to the government's political plans and ambitions resides in
                            dissident civilian and ex-military elements who see in the “mainstream”
                            of the revolution a long-term threat to their own political survival and
                            ambitions. There is also opposition within the junta to the dominant
                            role played by <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim Chong-p'il</persName>
                            and the “young colonels” in the government's plans: deep factional
                            differences exist and intense political maneuvering is taking place. The
                            students remain a latent force capable of action or manipulation when
                            sufficiently stimulated and an opportunity arises.</p>
                        <p>The outcome of the ferment and political processes which are now
                            beginning is by no means certain. The government party will probably win
                            a contrived election, but there are a number of possible variations in
                            what might follow:</p>
                        <pb n="617" xml:id="pg_617" facs="0653"/>
                        <p>a. Pak-<persName>Kim</persName> and the “core group” of the revolution
                            would then govern in authoritarian fashion, gradually eliminating
                            opposition threats to power;</p>
                        <p>b. Differences within the junta may erupt sooner or later in an all-out
                            fight. If <persName>Kim</persName> and his faction win, they could hold
                            power by extreme methods. If they lose, new alliances, possibly on a
                            broader basis, would form but be plagued by factional differences;</p>
                        <p>c. The junta would hold together, but in the aftermath, the actions taken
                            to gain victory would create schisms between the government and the
                            people who would not accept continued rule by a narrow elite of military
                            men;</p>
                        <p>d. After election, Korea would move toward increasingly successful
                            representative government on an increasingly democratic basis. Instead
                            of military authoritarianism there would be a gradual broadening of
                            power and moderation in government over several years.</p>
                        <p>Political tension exists in Korea. There is apprehension, dissatisfaction
                            and fear among articulate groups in and out of government. Any
                            complacency as to stability of leadership is unwarranted. The Embassy is
                            concerned that the political trend may move contrary to our objective of
                            a politically stable Korea with an increasing capacity to govern itself
                            on a democratic basis.</p>
                        <p>In the current situation the US should try to minimize the danger of
                            sharp changes which would only replace the present uneasy and tense
                            stability with irrational instability. We should concentrate on
                            moderating government actions, but prepare for the contingency that may
                            require a change in our attitude and policy toward the military
                            regime.</p>
                        <p>For the immediate future we should urge the government to accept the need
                            for taking measures to promote national unity and advise the widest
                            possible clearance of people banned from political activity under the
                            Political Purification Law. We should urge the need for the widest
                            possible freedom of debate, assembly and press consistent with normal
                            security considerations. We should not threaten specific action if our
                            advice is not taken but should leave no illusion that the US supports
                            all the political plans of the government. We should be prepared, if
                            necessary, to issue a prudent statement setting forth US policy with
                            respect to the return to representative government.<note n="1" xml:id="d285fn1">In airgram 404 from Seoul, also December 7,
                                    <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName> reported on a
                                conversation with Pak about the upcoming elections and the return to
                                constitutional government. Pak stated that an effort would be made
                                to avoid encouragement of splinter parties and to discourage vote
                                buying and corruption. When <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName> mentioned the need to clear currently
                                proscribed politicians, Pak raised his voice in objection, stressing
                                that the United States did not understand how unrepentant these
                                politicians were. <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName>
                                encouraged Pak to create the broadest-based government political
                                party possible. <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName> asked
                                Pak to stop other <gloss target="#t_SCNR1">SCNR</gloss> members and
                                government officials from claiming that the United States endorsed
                                the government's election plan. <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName> stated that the United States was neither
                                endorsing or not endorsing the plan, and would be neutral in the
                                elections. Pak promised free and fair elections. (Ibid.)</note>

                        <p>We should begin to think in terms of a possible need for alternatives for
                            leadership in Korea. At the moment, we do not have a clear idea of what
                            these alternatives may be. As a prerequisite the Koreans themselves must
                            coalesce into coherent groups and show readiness to work for their own
                            political evolution without excesses. We should be cautious and not try
                            to be the decisive internal political force ourselves. Many thoughtful
                            Koreans believe the military government is embarked on a disastrous
                            course. On the other hand, some continue to reserve judgment until after
                            political activity gets under way. Others intend to reserve judgment
                            until after elections. We, too, should wait. When we see our problem
                            more clearly, it may be desirable for the Ambassador to return to
                            Washington for consultation to consider new policy lines.</p>

                        <p>1. Congratulations on your success in moderating Pak's plan for settling
                            current crisis within ruling group. We agree optimism must be restrained
                            until we see how events unfold in next few days. On basis your excellent
                            reporting, however, it appears we may now pass through crisis and gain
                            better relationship with Pak than previously existed.</p>
                        <p>2. At appropriate time assume you will wish to make use of improved
                            rapport with Pak to advise him further on transition to civilian
                            rule.</p>
                        <p>3. Line which you took with Pak in your talk January 16 (Embassy's 503)
                            is in general accord with our thinking.<note n="2" xml:id="d286fn2">In

                                on January 16 with Pak on the political situation. In telegram 504
                                from Seoul, January 18, <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName> commented on this discussion. Telegram 504
                                was designated as “part two of two,” while telegram 503 was “part
                                one of two.” (Ibid., 795B.00/1-1763 and 795B.00/1-1963)</note> We
                            recognize that if Korean <pb n="619" xml:id="pg_619" facs="0655"/>people
                            believe transition to civilian rule has been rigged, chances of
                            popularly supported and stable government may well be lost. Your advice
                            to Pak on need for broader base for ruling group and for effective
                            opposition therefore remains valid if it is not interpreted as effort to
                            push Korea with unrealistic rapidity into American style representative
                            government. In current Korean situation, political forms are probably
                            less important than effective government with broad popular support. We
                            therefore suggest that in future you place comments on need for
                            broadening base of regime in context of overriding need to gain popular
                            support. Regime must make more active effort to reach and influence
                            important groups such as students, intellectuals, labor and farmers, and
                            broaden popular support by promulgating and vigorously pursuing policies
                            which accord with popular needs and aspirations.</p>

                            and transition to civilian government might be frustrated. Also if
                            leadership such a coup were restricted to Hamg-yong faction we would
                            question whether it could command significant popular support.</p>

                                February 12, the Embassy reported that as a result of increasing

                                and within Korea as a whole, which arose from renewed political

                                the short-term prospects for normalization of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>-Japan relations were becoming

                        <p>All my information is to the effect that if we don't get this settlement
                            agreed to very shortly, the occasion may pass away for the foreseeable

                            a great deal is at stake here: almost half a billion dollars of Japanese
                            capital coming into Korea in a way which makes it likely that it would
                            be more effectively used for development than the equivalent amount of

                            conclusion. Although I have no specific idea of my own to offer, I do
                            think we must rack our brains to find the best method of making another

                            our attitude toward Chairman Pak, his government and their plans for

                            power, dissension among revolutionary leaders, growing public knowledge
                            of <persName>Kim</persName>'s stock market operations, dissatisfaction

                            growing opposition criticism of govt's policies and actions, have been
                            combining to weaken govt's unity and discredit it in eyes of people,
                            even in countryside where govt previously enjoyed considerable support.
                            Economic situation involving rising prices and inflationary pressures
                            being exaggerated beyond its real significance. Economy not in as bad
                            condition as attributed, however, there has been loss of confidence
                            which has added to political difficulties. Public apprehension that
                            military govt is losing US confidence is also contributing to gradually
                            rising atmosphere of uneasiness. There is probability of trouble in
                            which students and even other groups will participate, Universities
                            reopen March 1 and both govt and opposition leaders have indicated to US
                            student political activity expected thereafter. Now apparent govt party
                            will find it difficult to win a fair election. Pak reportedly showing
                            signs of concern over his ability to resolve political and economic
                            instabilities.</p>
                        <p>3. Two weeks ago there was outside chance that if <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim Chong-p'il</persName> left govt party country
                            situation might remain reasonably stable during transition. It now
                            appears that <persName>Kim</persName>'s retirement from scene would be
                            helpful but would not in itself suffice to deal with whole complex of
                            factors <pb n="623" xml:id="pg_623" facs="0659"/>which are evolving. Yun
                            Po-sun and Ho Chong have made strong pleas to us that both
                                <persName>Kim</persName> and Pak must withdraw with Pak continuing
                            in caretaker role until after election, or there will be no hope for
                            political stability. A very different view is being advocated by some
                            revolutionary leaders, who fear calling off election, reimposing martial
                            law, and holding power for another year or two. These are symptoms of
                            crisis, and it can only be resolved if <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> throws full force of our position into situation.</p>
                        <p>4. In our view establishment of political and economic stability and
                            restoration of public confidence now require fundamental actions:</p>
                        <p>A. On economic side, there must be immediate checks on inflationary
                            pressure and moves to stabilize the won. <persName corresp="#p_KJS1">Killen</persName> is working with new Chairman <gloss target="#t_EPB1">EPB</gloss> to develop policies to accomplish this.
                            The measures required would mean sharp modification of current govt
                            economic policies re budget management, credit, and money supply, and
                            trimming 5-year economic plan projects. These would probably be
                            politically unpalatable, especially to <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim
                                Chong-p'il</persName> and his govt party. Pak might more easily
                            carry out these measures if he removed himself from political campaign
                            and assumed caretaker role with our support.</p>
                        <p>B. On political side, threat to stability might be reduced if Pak
                            announced that he will keep revolutionary pledge to return power to
                            civilian hands, will not run as candidate and will assume caretaker role
                            until transfer accomplished. With US support Pak could hold military
                            forces together on side of orderly transition, and deal with any counter
                            move against his decision. Such a decision by Pak would necessitate
                            negotiations with party leaders, changes in political party law and
                            election law (it is too late to change constitution), probable delay in
                            elections until June or July, and lifting all political purification
                            bans. <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim Chong-p'il</persName> would need
                            to leave Korea.</p>
                        <p>5. I cannot go much further here on my own initiative without clear Dept
                            decision and support. If Pak sees me, as I requested and tells me he has
                            decided to withdraw from presidential race and assume caretaker role,
                            this may be genuine, but he will be under most terrific pressure to
                            reverse himself and almost certainly government party conference
                            February 25 will seek to draft him. Alternately, he may tell me he has
                            weighed all factors and decided no course is desirable, but one which
                            promises to minimize instability is for him to run. If Pak is drafted or
                            runs voluntarily for president, <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim
                                Chong-p'il</persName> will stay. In any of these cases, I will urge
                            him to talk to opposition leaders, especially Ho Chong and Yun Po-sun
                            before making his decision final. In absence of Dept's instruction I do
                            not feel that I can say anything more to him except that I will report
                            his views to Dept.</p>

                        <p>A. Not intervene and let situation develop. This I think dangerous, and
                            an abdication of our responsibilities.</p>
                        <p>B. Encourage Pak to run for president, which means <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim Chong-p'il</persName> will stay. This will
                            align US with a govt increasingly unpopular, alienate US from the
                            people, and may involve US in support of a govt that may have to resort
                            to force to deal with discontent both within its ranks and outside. I
                            cannot see us following this course because it will probably fyt [<hi rend="italic">not</hi>?] produce stability. It will produce a govt
                            which will be basically undemocratic, even more difficult to work with,
                            and will vest unacceptable power in hands of <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim Chong-p'il</persName>.</p>
                        <p>C. Tell Pak that <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim Chong-p'il</persName>
                            must leave country for a year, and that he must negotiate with
                            opposition leaders for adjustments in elevation [<hi rend="italic">election</hi>?] law. That it would be preferable for him to retire
                            to caretaker role, but if he feels this would create too much
                            instability we will abide by his decision, and our further attitude
                            toward situation and this govt will depend on conduct of elections and
                            course of development. This may or may not be acceptable to opposition
                            and may or may not produce stability, but it deals with some of basic
                            problems in picture. This may involve a further postponement of the
                            elections.</p>
                        <p>D. Tell Pak and opposition leaders that only solution is to form govt of
                            national unity, that will govern say for one year, while new election
                            laws, political party laws, and constitution are drafted for eventual
                            transition. This would involve us in formation of a new govt in which
                            Pak possibly could serve as Acting President, Ho Chong possibly as
                            PriMin, etc. <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim Chong-p'il</persName>
                            would have to leave country. There is much to be said for this but it
                            will be almost impossible to realize.</p>
                        <p>7. Next two weeks are critical and I would urge Asst Secy <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> to plan to come here next week
                            in order to:</p>

                        <p>B. Emphasize to all parties here seriousness of our concern with
                            situation;</p>
                        <p>C. Assist us in working out acceptable understanding between Pak and
                            opposition for transition to civilian rule; and possible understanding
                            on <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>-Japan settlement;</p>
                        <p> D. Throw full weight of US behind solution we decide on.</p>

                                Pak stated he was leaning toward retirement from politics, but
                                agreed to make no public statement until <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName> had a chance to explore the situation and

                            difficult. You may, however, wish to repeat in strong terms advice that

                        <p> Pak's Offer to Withdraw. Chairman Pak Chong-hui today publicly proposed
                            a compromise settlement. His crucial points were: in return for
                            assurances of no retaliation against members of the junta and
                            revolutionary government officials he would abstain from political
                            activity; politicians still restricted under the Political Purification
                            Law would, with some exceptions, be cleared; and the election would be
                            postponed until after May. He gave all party leaders until February 23
                            to accept or reject the plan.<note n="1" xml:id="d291fn1">As reported in

                        <p>Expected Party and Junta Reactions. The political leaders will be
                            inclined to accept Pak's terms. They realize that the
                            government-sponsored party will have little appeal if Pak does not run
                            as its presidential candidate. Furthermore, postponing the elections
                            would give the opposition parties a real opportunity to organize. Most
                            members of the <pb n="627" xml:id="pg_627" facs="0663"/>junta can
                            probably accept the settlement proposed by Pak, but <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim Chong-p'il</persName> and his group might be
                            justifiably fearful of their fate despite the non-retaliation proviso.
                            Their reaction remains an unknown but probably unsettling factor.</p>
                        <p>Intensified Maneuverings. Pak may be merely attempting to gain a
                            temporary respite or to provoke a reaction which would rationalize a
                            thinly disguised continuation of the present military role. More
                            probably he is really seeking a solution. During the next few days
                            feverish negotiations among Pak, the junta factions, and the political
                            leaders can be expected. Discussions will center on the commitment
                            against retaliation and on the extent of the political clearance offered
                            by Pak.</p>

                        <p>On February 18, 1963, Chairman Pak Chung-hui told Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName> that he was considering
                            withdrawing from the presidential race. Pak noted the strong opposition
                            within the military government to the Director of the Korean Central
                            Intelligence Agency, <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim Chong
                                P'il</persName>. Pak also told <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName> he was disillusioned with politics and government
                            and had met with political leaders on February 14 to discuss his future.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName> informed the
                            Department of State of these developments and received instructions to
                            inform Pak that the United States considered his withdrawal the best
                            hope for political and economic stability.</p>
                        <p> Pak announced on February 18 that he was willing to withdraw from the
                            presidential election, provided opposition political leaders would agree
                            on a nine-point program featuring political harmony, continuation of
                            certain basic political objectives, including normalization of relations
                            with Japan. The U.S. Embassy immediately gave public support to the
                            proposal, saying that it believed the plan provided a basis for the
                            smooth transition to civilian government through the democratic process
                            in an atmosphere of national unity and stability. The principal South
                            Korean political leaders accepted the scheme formally on February

                                telegram 639, March 14, <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName> reported a conversation he had with Prime
                                Minister Kim Hyon-chol who informed <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName> that the situation was becoming increasingly
                                chaotic as a result of various coup and assassination plots. The
                                Prime Minister expected large-scale student demonstrations in favor
                                of Pak reversing himself and agreeing to run for President. He also
                                predicted anti-American student demonstrations.
                                    <persName>Kim</persName> stated that plotting was widespread and
                                the threat to the Military Government was serious. According to Kim
                                Hyon-chol, many <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> army units were
                                involved and there could even be defection of frontline <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> troops to North Korea.

                        </p>
                        <p>1. After seeing PriMin I went directly to Gen <persName corresp="#p_MGGS1">Meloy</persName> to discuss PriMin's alarming
                            observations about extent of armed forces involvement in new coup plots.
                            Gen Kim Chong-oh, C/S <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Army, was with
                            Gen <persName corresp="#p_MGGS1">Meloy</persName> and I asked him to
                            join us.</p>
                        <p>2. They both expressed astonishment and disbelief in PriMin's information
                            (para 3 reftel) discounted most of it, and wondered where he got his
                            info. Gen <persName>Kim</persName> said he knew nothing of possible
                            frontline unit defections.</p>
                        <p>3. I said I had to report PriMin's remarks to Washington, and while I
                            welcomed these assurances, fact remained that two coup plots had been
                            uncovered, that previous evening PriMin informed me of coup plot by
                            rightist “Chokchong” and of reports that members of political party were
                            organizing terrorist group to assassinate Park. With four major groups
                            involved or allegedly involved in coup plots, I thought it essential Gen
                                <persName corresp="#p_MGGS1">Meloy</persName> and I meet with Park,
                            all Chiefs of Staff, Minister of Defense, and PriMin to discuss
                            situation. I asked Gen <persName>Kim</persName> what would be impact on
                            armed forces if substantial numbers from four major Korean factional or
                            political groups were arrested. Could forces be kept united under these
                            circumstances? Gen <persName>Kim</persName> said effect would be very
                            serious.</p>
                        <p>4. I said if any person is really involved in a coup plot the Korean Govt
                            must, of course, act. But speaking frankly I thought some of these
                            reports of plots or involvement were fabricated for the clear purpose of
                            creating turmoil in order force Chairman Park to reverse his Feb 18
                            decision.</p>
                        <p>5. I asked Gen <persName>Kim</persName> who was stimulating student
                            anti-American demonstrations? Who was spreading propaganda about
                            American intervention? Who encouraged Chairman Park to propose to
                            introduce <pb n="629" xml:id="pg_629" facs="0665"/>martial law, suspend
                            political activity, and delay elections? Who planted the phony story
                            that chief of air force had resigned? Who besides Communists had an
                            interest in turmoil.</p>
                        <p>6. I pointed out that it was Chiefs of Staff and Minister of Defense who
                            gave Chairman Park ultimatum that <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim
                                Chong-p'il</persName> must leave country and there must be an
                            investigation into <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> scandals. This would not be forgiven by
                                <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim Chong-p'il</persName> and his
                            supporters. Did this mean that he and other Chiefs of Staff and Minister
                            of Defense would before long find themselves on list of people accused
                            of something or other and purged? We had much evidence that <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim Chong-p'il</persName>'s machine in and out of
                            Democratic Republican Party was still intact, well financed, and active,
                            and he knew as well as we that they are determined to create confusion
                            in order to force Park to call off his Feb 18 announcement.</p>
                        <p>7. Gen <persName>Kim</persName> did not dissent, I asked where Korea was
                            going, saying we want to help Chairman Park during transition and will
                            do what we can to keep situation stable. But it is now in Korean hands
                            whether some semblance of reason and order will be introduced into
                            situation. Korean armed forces were only stable and stabilizing
                            institution in Korea. He and other Chiefs of Staff had moved into
                            chaotic situation in early February and brought some sense and stability
                            into situation. Park's Feb 18 announcement and <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim Chong-p'il</persName>'s departure were the
                            result. Gen <persName corresp="#p_MGGS1">Meloy</persName> and I said
                            that that achievement was now threatened. The situation was again
                            disintegrating and he and his colleagues had once again to move in to
                            make their weight and wisdom felt.</p>

                                asked if there would be a “national debate” on the referendum and

                            government. The Department replied authorizing <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName> to tell Pak we did not approve

                        <p>INTELLIGENCE NOTE</p>
                        <p>Latest Indications from the Republic of Korea</p>
                        <p>Concerted Moves to Purge Opposition. There is evidence that some force,
                            probably the organization which <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim
                                Chong-p'il</persName> built around the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> and the government political party, is moving to break
                            the power of several possible opposition groups and prolong the period
                            of military government. Many of the leaders of the Hamkyong Faction of
                            the junta have been jailed. The Cabinet has resigned and it appears that
                            the Minister of Defense—who last month joined with the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Chiefs of Staff in forcing
                                <persName>Kim</persName> out of the country—will not be reappointed.
                            Small groups of military demonstrators have demanded the extension of
                            military rule; the demonstrations were probably inspired and were
                            certainly tolerated by the regime. There are reports that the government
                            is prepared to place charges of coup plotting against two or three other
                            major factional groups within the armed forces and a number of
                            politicians, including the heads of state during the interim government
                            of 1960 and republic of 1960-61. Chairman Pak Chong-hui may again impose
                            martial law.</p>
                        <p>Changes in the Power Spectrum. The government's actions seem to have at
                            least temporarily stunned potential opposition. The Hamkyong Faction has
                            been rendered harmless by the arrest of its leaders. The military
                            leaders are not exerting their strength and seem bewildered by the pace
                            of recent developments. Civilian politicians appear to be even further
                            removed from positions of influence. The status of the <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim Chong-p'il</persName> organization is
                            unknown; investigations of the many scandals in which
                                <persName>Kim</persName> was involved have led to some arrests but
                            it is not clear whether this has yet affected the basis of his
                            power.</p>
                        <p> Pak's Intentions Estimated. It is clear that the actions already taken
                            could not have been without Pak's acquiescence or, perhaps, cooperation.
                            It is also clear that these actions involve real danger of chaos both
                            within the political world and the armed forces, and aim at postponing
                            civilian government.</p>
                        <p>Two opposite views are conceivable: 1) that Pak never intended to bow out
                            of politics and contrived the entire coup plot situation as a cover to
                            renege on his previous promises or 2) that Pak would like to carry
                            through on his pledge, but is being used by <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim Chong-p'il</persName>'s followers to promote their own cause.
                            Another possibility is that Pak had believed that he could move toward a
                            civilian government without sacrificing <persName>Kim</persName>—whom he
                            has consistently protected—or greatly reducing his own <pb n="634" xml:id="pg_634" facs="0670"/>power. Finding this impossible in the
                            situation which followed <persName>Kim</persName>'s departure he may now
                            be driven toward a desperate effort to regain control.</p>
                        <p>United States Interests. To turn back the clock at this point may be
                            possible, briefly, but can hardly bring stability for any prolonged
                            period. The Pak-<persName>Kim</persName> axis is too thinly based, and
                            the knowledge of the military government's failures is now too widely
                            known. The group pushing for such a reversal will be aware that the
                            United States will not view such changes with equanimity and they will
                            try to prevent the exercise of American influence by inspiring criticism
                            of alleged US influence in Korean affairs. There are reports that some
                            student demonstrations along this line are being inspired. In addition,
                            the regime may seize upon the internal crisis to seek additional US aid
                            as necessary to stabilize the situation.</p>

                                referendum was a scheme to retain power, but the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Service Chiefs told <persName corresp="#p_MGGS1">Meloy</persName> that in order to maintain

                                are the strongest and most reliable stabilizing influence in Korea.
                                It is wrong to mess around with aid and force levels.”

                                his statement could not be final. “We are continuing to maintain
                                very close contact with what's going on there. We are anxious for
                                stability in the area. We regard South Korea, of course, as an
                                important interest in the security of Asia and therefore we are
                                continuing to follow very closely the present discussions about the

                                latitude for free debate and a reduction of military rule to less

                        <p>1. We consider it unwise tie ourselves any particular solution,
                            especially at this time, because:</p>
                        <p>a. We and Korean opposition have good cause be suspicious of good faith
                            Chairman Pak and his advisors;</p>
                        <p>b. We do not yet have views of principal opposition leaders;</p>
                        <p>c. We are not clear concerning real views of Kim Chong-o and other
                            service chiefs, despite their public support of Pak's March 16
                            decision.</p>
                        <p>2. Our objectives are:</p>
                        <p>a. Creation of stable government with sufficient base of political and
                            popular support;</p>
                        <p>b. Removal of Korean military from political arena; and</p>
                        <p>c. Maintenance of international support of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_UNC1">UNC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>3. To these ends, we believe transition to civilian government should be
                            effected through elections at earliest practical date. Military <pb n="637" xml:id="pg_637" facs="0673"/>junta is broken by military
                            factional quarrels and probably faces declining stability and
                            popularity. Also, if repeatedly promised elections are not held before
                            1963 <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> we will have hard time
                            explaining and will run risk of losing much of international support
                            that is vital for <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_UNC1">UNC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>4. We agree you should give no encouragement to compromise on basis of
                            making proposed referendum freer or shortening extension of military
                            rule (para 6 ref A). Under present circumstances, it almost
                            inconceivable any assurances of free political discussion would be
                            fulfilled. Recent suspension political activity and arrest party leaders
                            has created impossible atmosphere for referendum. As for mere shortening
                            period of extension, we consider one or two year extension to have no
                            greater justification and to be basically open to similar objections as
                            four year extension. We do not believe atmosphere for smooth transition
                            to effective civilian government likely improve with only passage of
                            time.</p>
                        <p>5. Prime emphasis should continue to be placed on need for genuine
                            consultation by junta with civilian leaders, including necessarily
                            opposition leaders Ho Chong and <persName corresp="#p_YP1">Yun
                                Po-sun</persName>, who are obviously of greater stature than others
                            on scene. We thoroughly approve your stressing this point in discussing
                            plan for reorganizing <gloss target="#t_SCNR1">SCNR</gloss> with General
                            Kim Chong-o (para 5 ref B).</p>
                        <p>6. In order to be in better position to bring about meaningful
                            consultation between junta and civilian opposition leaders, you should
                            at earliest opportunity secure directly or indirectly views of major
                            opposition leaders and report them with your recommendations and
                            comment. Although we certainly would not support their arbitrary veto of
                            a reasonable solution, we should be careful not undercut them in dealing
                            with government side, since future government will almost surely sooner
                            or later come from their camp. You should urge them make constructive
                            approach and give junta leaders an honorable way out and assurances as
                            to future role and safety.</p>
                        <p>7. We would find return to February 27 formula thoroughly acceptable and
                            believe best arrangement might be along those lines, if junta and
                            opposition can agree upon it. Idea of compromise by returning to
                            February 27 agreement if “corrupt” politicians withdraw is hard to
                            understand. Who is to decide who is corrupt? You might point out entire
                            political purification concept has been strongly censured outside Korea
                            as well as inside, and ask specifically whether such men as Ho Chong,
                                <persName corresp="#p_YP1">Yun Po-sun</persName> and Kim Pyong-no
                            are judged to be corrupt and if so why. <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>. Despite lack of clarity in this compromise proposal,
                            it should not be rejected out of hand. It might in fact be acceptable if
                            only few second-rank politicians are required to retire. End <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>8. We believe it important for you to continue your talks with General
                            Kim Chong-o, since he played part in developing February 27 formula <pb n="638" xml:id="pg_638" facs="0674"/>and later opposed martial law
                            and was not consulted regarding extension military rule, and since he is
                            chief figure in group you consider new main military force. As for his
                            ostensible support of junta's March 16 decision, we do not see how he
                            could realistically be expected to do otherwise. Despite show of
                            military unity on March 22, we have impression factionalism exists in
                            military forces as a whole, that many military strongly believe military
                            should not be involved in politics, and many still hold to long Korean
                            tradition that armed forces do not have internal security role,
                            especially against popular movements.</p>
                        <p>9. Although we are skeptical about practicability and durability
                            civil-military combination, we recognize it has some potential as short
                            interim arrangement pending elections. Under such arrangement Chairman
                            Pak should, however, be bound by collegiate action of enlarged <gloss target="#t_SCNR1">SCNR</gloss>, and cease his recent practice of
                            one-man decisions based apparently on advice from outside <gloss target="#t_SCNR1">SCNR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>10. At appropriate point, you should let Chairman Pak know that in our
                            view return of <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim Chong-p'il</persName> to
                            Korea would be most unfortunate, both in terms of prospects for Korean

                            The purpose of this meeting is to bring you up-to-date on developments
                            in Korea in the past few weeks.</p>
                        <p>As you will recall, the military junta, headed by Chairman Park, came
                            into power in Korea in May 1961. At the outset our attitude toward the
                            Government was equivocal; but Ambassador Berger, after several months at
                            his post, came to the conclusion that the military junta might provide
                            Korea with a stable, reasonably clean government and one that we could
                            work with.</p>
                        <p>The junta functioned well for the first year; but beginning in early 1962
                            a series of difficulties began to arise. In April of that year the junta
                            adopted a political Purification Law, which in effect banned political
                            activity by the opposition for a period of 6 years. In June of 1962 the
                            junta adopted a currency conversion program and froze private bank
                            accounts. The effect on the economy was depressing and confidence was
                            badly shaken. Shortly after this action, it became known that <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim Chong-pil</persName>, head of the Korean
                                <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> and Chairman Park's son-in-law,
                            had made the greatest financial coup in Korean history by manipulating
                            the stock market for a profit of approximately $20 to $30 million. There
                            are suspicions of other financial manipulations by the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The junta had announced at the beginning of its regime that it would
                            transfer power to a popularly elected civilian government in the summer
                            of 1963. It repeated this promise from time to time and secured the
                            adoption of a new constitution by referendum. Last January a pro-junta
                            political party was formed, headed by <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim
                                Chong-pil</persName> with the purpose of securing the election of
                            Chairman Park as President and, it later turned out, the maintenance of
                                <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim Chong-pil</persName> in power. At
                            this point the junta began coming to pieces because of the conflict
                            between <persName>Kim</persName> and other factions of the military
                            junta. On February 18th Chairman Park, having become disillusioned with
                            the military administration, announced that he would withdraw from the
                            presidential race provided the civilian <pb n="640" xml:id="pg_640" facs="0676"/>political leaders would agree upon a 9-point program
                            featuring political harmony and the continuation of certain basic
                            political objectives, including the normalization of relations with
                            Japan. The political leaders accepted and <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim Chong-pil</persName> left the country as a roving
                            ambassador.</p>
                        <p>At the beginning of this month a series of coup plots and counter plots
                            preceded an announcement by Chairman Park on March 16th that he
                            considered it necessary for the military rule to be extended for four
                            more years, and that a national referendum would be held on this subject
                            in April. There is some evidence that some, if not all, of the coup
                            plots were engineered to support Park's announcement.</p>
                        <p>At the moment the situation is still unclear. The Korean military leaders
                            have apparently sided with Chairman Park, and the civilian politicians
                            remain adamant in their refusal to accept what appears to them to be an
                            indefinite extension of the military government. We have been pressing
                            for a “pan-national” solution in which the civilians and the military
                            would get together to agree on a compromise government which would
                            represent a broader range of Korean political life. There has been some
                            evidence that Chairman Park may be reconsidering his insistence on
                            prolongation of military rule. In the meantime he has sent you a
                            personal letter, which is reported in the attached cable.<note n="2" xml:id="d298fn2">In a March 19 letter to President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>, Pak detailed his reasons

                                Pak cited the recent political situation, “the dishonorable feud

                            it was necessary to extend military rule in Korea four more years.</p>
                        <p>The President remarked that he and the American people were concerned for
                            the future of South Korea and were anxious to see the country
                            successful. The President stressed the importance of avoiding political
                            instability which would prevent an evolution into democratic procedures.
                            The President said that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName> spoke for the United States, and that the
                            President shared the Ambassador's hope that the military and civilian
                            leaders in Korea could reach an accord establishing a timetable for the
                            smooth transition to civilian government.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Chung responded that Chairman Park was doing his best, and
                            said that the military leaders have stepped into the situation with a
                            constructive program. The Ambassador said that he would convey the
                            President's remarks to Chairman Park.</p>
                        <p>The President re-emphasized the importance of finding a Korean solution

                                April 8, the Embassy commented on a plan, announced by the <gloss target="#t_SCNR1">SCNR</gloss> on April 8, to hold “in abeyance”
                                until September the national referendum scheduled for April. During
                                September the government would examine the political situation with
                                representatives of political parties and decide whether to hold the
                                referendum or go ahead with the presidential and National Assembly
                                elections. In the meantime, the announcement continued, the
                                government would concentrate on improving its administrative
                                functions and deal with food shortages. Political activities by
                                political parties would be allowed, but the government expected the
                                parties to reform themselves. (Telegram 787 from Seoul, April 8;
                                ibid.) The Embassy noted that there were three positive aspects of
                                this announcement: postponement of the April referendum on
                                continuation of military rule, the commitment to discuss the future
                                with the opposition, and lifting the ban on political activity.

                        <p>1. For time being at least, we believe U.S. should minimize its
                            involvement in junta's April 8 solution to political controversy for
                            following reasons:</p>
                        <p>A. Solution must be a Korean solution.</p>
                        <p>B. As it now stands, suspension formula is not clear cut resolution of
                            controversy, particularly since commitment to hold elections has not
                            been voiced publicly or apparently even privately to opposition
                            leaders.</p>
                        <p>C. Formula thus far represents unilateral action by junta rather than
                            agreement with opposition.</p>

                                emphasize the positive. (Ibid.)</note> but suggest you avoid
                            endorsing April 8 formula or strongly encouraging them to accept it
                            unqualifiedly. We agree it desirable that civilian leaders use April 8
                            statement constructively. It would now appear to be sound tactic for
                            them to press for elections and for verification of govt's real
                            intention regarding elections.</p>
                        <p>3. Dept plans make no early comment on April 8 formula and may hold to
                            that position even after reaction of civilian political leaders has been
                            clarified.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>1. Since January we have been preoccupied with day-to-day aspects of
                            political crises and negotiations on economic stabilization measures,
                            punctuated by rapid changes in junta and cabinet membership. Sudden and
                            dramatic changes in situation have made it all but impossible to put
                            together political, economic and psychological assessments in kind of
                            perspective necessary for Washington's understanding of situation here.
                            With Pak's announcement on April 8 delaying until Sept decision on
                            elections, and with Korean Govt's commitment to <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> last week to adopt certain anti-inflationary measures,
                            it is now possible to provide an interim assessment which has immediate
                            relevance to certain policy decisions Washington must make.</p>
                        <p>2. On political side I shall be sending this week Embassy's analysis of
                            various elements now in motion and play of forces, issues and
                            personalities. It is our present view that moderate elements in junta
                            are making genuine and serious effort to find basis for holding
                            elections this year, because they think referendum proposal to prolong
                            military rule does not hold out prospect for stability in Korea. Our
                            strong stand was an <pb n="644" xml:id="pg_644" facs="0680"/>important
                            factor in this conclusion, but it was also determined by adverse action
                            within Korea itself. Indeed I think latter was decisive reason for
                            decision to abandon April referendum.</p>
                        <p>3. What is now going on is an examination and behind-the-scenes talks by
                            moderate military and civilian leaders of the problems of providing
                            Korea with a political solution that hopefully, through elections this
                            year, will provide a stable and effective govt. It will be some weeks or
                            months before results are discernible. Meanwhile tension has subsided
                            and immediate danger of domestic collision has been averted.</p>
                        <p>4. With this easing of political situation country's attention now being
                            concentrated more and more on economic instability, attributable in part
                            to political uncertainties, but in the main to inflationary pressures
                            generated during 1962 and continued in 1963. Industrial production, tax
                            collections and exports have held well during first quarter, but the
                            rise in domestic prices, fall in foreign exchange reserves, and growing
                            propensity to hoard in anticipation of accentuated price inflation are
                            now producing great nervousness in country. Govt took some steps in
                            March to curb inflation by means of credit restrictions and last week
                            agreed with <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> to cut budget and
                            reduce deficit. They represent substantial measures in right directions.
                            Whether Korea Govt can during balance of 1963 resist pressures to modify
                            them, can be argued. Our immediate problem during next four critical
                            months, while political solutions are being sought, is to encourage govt
                            to hold to its stabilization plans and to take US actions that will help
                            keep economic situation as stable as possible.</p>
                        <p>5. Current pressing problem is upward trend of rice prices. This arises
                            in part from smaller crop in 1962 in part from natural inclination of
                            farmers and merchants to hoard in anticipation of higher price rises
                            this year, and in part from inflated incomes of largest segment of
                            population during last eighteen months which they are using to buy more
                            food. Only 400,000 tons of wheat provided under Nov 1962 PL 480
                            agreement, along with carryover of wheat and barley from June 1962
                            agreement, added to Korea's own grain supplies, would give Korean people
                            during this year about same food intake as in 1961, but it does not
                            reckon with psychological, inflationary and higher consumption patterns
                            that are disturbing whole situation. From now until new rice crop
                            harvested in November I anticipate serious pressure on rice prices as
                            supplies thin out. I interpret govt's intention to import 50,000 tons of
                            rice from Japan on deferred credit terms, as psychological moves to
                            discourage hoarding and relieve pressure upon prices. It should have
                            some effect but fear of inflation and worry over declining foreign
                            exchange reserves are now so psychologically deep-seated in Korean
                            community and these two measures may not be adequate to arrest further
                            rises in price of rice.</p>
                        <p>6. Timing of our announcement of additional PL 480 wheat and cotton and
                            additional <gloss target="#t_SA1">SA</gloss> as requested in reftel will
                            have major psychological <pb n="645" xml:id="pg_645" facs="0681"/>impact. I feel strongly that an immediate Washington decision
                            supporting our request at least for PL 480 would contribute to political
                            and economic stability during next four critical months.</p>
                        <p>7. To summarize I think Korea is now in period of restless insecurity and
                            nervous instability. If we withhold PL 480 announcements until we have
                            iron-clad guarantees as to elections or performance indications in
                            respect to stabilization measures, it will only add to country's
                            frustrations and worsen matters. If we announce aid now we have a better
                            chance of influencing local personalities and local situation in
                            political and economic directions we would like to see them proceed.
                            Moreover Korean Govt is intent on settling with Japanese during these
                            months and will go to some length to make concessions on fisheries.
                            Evidences of our support of Korea during this period might be helpful in
                            persuading Japanese to conclude with this govt.</p>

                        <p>For the long pull, you may want to raise with <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName> the possible prospect of an urgent further need
                            for further reductions in both military and economic assistance to
                            Korea. He has been cooperative in responding to these pressures so far,
                            and will no doubt point out that he is the most virtuous of ambassadors
                            on this score. Nevertheless, programmed assistance for next year runs at
                            $205 million for <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> and $125-to-$145
                            million on the economic side (of which 80 million is PL 480). You may
                            want to point out to <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName> that
                            with the growing claims of India, and the possibility of major
                            reductions in the overall appropriation, something may have to give, and
                            Korea is necessarily a likely target. <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName> understands economics better than most
                            ambassadors, and anything you can do to get him thinking as a member of
                            your own team on this problem will help.</p>

                                the White House staff meeting on May 31, the following related
                                exchange took place: “In connection with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName>'s call on the President this
                                morning, <persName>Bundy</persName> asked if there were any ideas on
                                how the President should handle him. For the most part, the
                                President intends to tell him that he has been doing a good job out
                                in Korea, but Komer and Kaysen, eventually supported by
                                    <persName>Bundy</persName>, felt that the President should at
                                least indicate generally to the Ambassador a “clear line” to the
                                effect that if, as is very likely, Congress gets tough on foreign
                                economic and military assistance, the chances are high that a
                                substantial portion of their economizing will have to come out of
                                those areas where the programs continue relatively ‘fat,’ and over
                                $200 million of military assistance to Korean forces is fat indeed.”

                        </p>
                        <p>If Congress slashes the aid bill this year (or even if not) we'll have to
                            do some extensive reprogramming to find enough <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> for India and other possible new accounts. Korea, with
                            some $200 million <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> planned for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1964, is the logical source and that from
                            which <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> has generally drawn in the
                            past.</p>
                        <p>In fact, I'd argue that our investment in Korea far exceeds our strategic
                            interest. On top of over $5 billion already invested since the end of
                            the Korean War, we plan another billion in <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> alone over the next five years. Moreover, the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> falls so far short of being able to
                            fund even the local currency costs of its over-sized army that it's our
                            biggest remaining <gloss target="#t_SA1">SA</gloss> account ($90 million
                            in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> '63 and perhaps $400 million
                            planned for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 64-68).</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName>, State and <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> reportedly agree on a modest force cut
                            over the next two years. But this will provide only marginal savings. If
                            we gradually cut <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces back from 19
                            to 12 divisions, we might free as much as $50 million a year for use
                            elsewhere (depending on the rate of modernization of remaining
                            forces).</p>
                        <p>Obvious political factors make a force cut now a delicate operation, but
                            a case can be made for squeezing the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            military on political grounds. Aside from this, we have failed in the
                            decade since 1963 to get the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> economy
                            moving at a pace which would offer reasonable prospect of eventually
                            getting it off our backs. Maybe we should spend more on development, and
                            less on the military.</p>

                        <p>In short, Korea continues to be our most expensive military satellite. Is
                            it worth as much as it costs?</p>

                        <p>After photographers were admitted to the President's office, the
                            Ambassador handed the President his credentials, the letter recalling
                            his predecessor and his prepared statement. After reading the
                            Ambassador's statement, the President remarked that he had been pleased
                            over recent reports of progress in solving the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>'s political problems. The President said that he is
                            aware that Korea has serious economic problems. He said that the US will
                            continue to help to the limit of its ability, but our resources must be
                            spread over many countries. The Administration recently sent an aid
                            program to Congress but does not yet know what action Congress will
                            take.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName>Kim</persName> said that the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>'s heavy military burden adds to its economic problems.
                            The President asked whether it might be possible to reduce the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> military forces. Ambassador
                                <persName>Kim</persName> responded that this would be most difficult
                            since the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces are thinly spread
                            over a long line facing the Communists.</p>
                        <p>The President inquired into the status of the two American Army
                            helicopter pilots who were captured by the North Koreans last
                                month.<note n="3" xml:id="d309fn3">On May 17 Captain Ben W. Stutts

                                Michigan, were detained by North Korean authorities after their
                                helicopter strayed into North Korea and made a forced landing. On

                                the Department of State suggested in a public statement that July
                                27, the tenth anniversary of the Korean armistice, would be an
                                appropriate time to release the two Army captains. (<hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy: Current Documents,

                            problem. Ambassador <persName>Kim</persName> agreed and said that we may
                            expect the Communists to make the maximum propaganda exploitation of
                            their seizure of the pilots.</p>
                        <p>The President said that we continue to be interested in the negotiations
                            between Japan and the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>. We believe
                            that a settlement between Japan and Korea is most important. The extra
                            resources which Korea will obtain by means of the settlement will be
                            very useful in Korean economic development.</p>
                        <p>The President asked whether the fisheries question is the most important
                            issue still being negotiated between Japan and the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>. <pb n="651" xml:id="pg_651" facs="0687"/>Ambassador <persName>Kim</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_YJA1">Yager</persName> confirmed that this is the case.
                            Ambassador <persName>Kim</persName> remarked that both the Japanese and
                            Korean fishermen are complaining about the negotiations. The President
                            said that in his opinion this is a sign of progress. It would be much
                            worse if only one group of fishermen was complaining.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName>Kim</persName> said he has been instructed to do
                            what he can to facilitate a settlement with the Japanese, working here
                            in Washington with the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> and the
                            Japanese Embassy. The President said that he is sure that the State

                            After some bureaucratic delay we have succeeded in making approximately
                            $8,500,000 worth (about 160,000 tons) of grain available to the Koreans.
                            It will be nip and tuck whether the food arrives in Korea in time to
                            avert real shortages, and we have suggested strongly to the Japanese
                            that they make an interim contribution of rice. The Japanese have agreed
                            to contribute 40,000 tons.</p>

                                Seoul, July 12, the Embassy reported a series of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> governmental changes announced by
                                the SCNR, the most prominent of which was the replacement of Kim
                                Chae-chun as <gloss target="#t_KCIA1">KCIA</gloss> Director by Kim
                                Hyong-uk. The Embassy commented that these moves represented a
                                strengthening of <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim
                                    Chong-p'il</persName>'s forces and an “ominous indication” that
                                Pak Chung-hui was preparing the ground for the return of <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim Chong-p'il</persName>. (Ibid.)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. With Pak's latest moves (see reftel) hand of Pak-Kim Chong-p'il group
                            has been strengthened, and Korea has moved into another period
                            accentuated instability. We believe these moves were undertaken for
                            following reasons:</p>
                        <p>A. Outright clash between junta moderates led by Kim Chae-ch'un and
                                pro-<persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim Chong-p'il</persName> group had
                            reached acute stage which could not be resolved by compromise. In making
                            decision Pak chose go along with pro-Kim hard core with which he is most
                            closely linked.</p>
                        <p>B. Pak's growing concern he cannot win a free election owing to Korea's
                            food difficulties, accelerating price inflation, and declining popular
                            confidence in ability of military junta to govern effectively and
                            honestly.</p>
                        <pb n="653" xml:id="pg_653" facs="0689"/>
                        <p>C. With this group in control it would be easier either to rig elections,
                            if held this year, or to deal with reaction if Pak decides to postpone
                            them again and prolong military rule. In latter event he will use excuse
                            that “food crisis, irresponsible political criticism, and economic and
                            political confusion and instability” do not permit elections to take
                            place.</p>
                        <p>D. Probability of junta's need to toughen repressive policy to curb press
                            and opposition criticism as well as criticism from within certain
                            military elements in effort maintain Pak-Kim group in power.</p>
                        <p>E. Need to tighten control in order to cover up Pak and <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim Chong-p'il</persName>'s responsibility for
                            stock market scandal and other misdeeds.</p>
                        <p>F. Desire to set stage for <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim
                                Chong-p'il</persName>'s return when Pak decides the time is right or
                            if he feels that he cannot manage the situation without
                                <persName>Kim</persName>'s presence.</p>
                        <p>2. Timing of latest developments worth mentioning. That they came after
                            additional US food commitment and additional $15 million support
                            assistance announced, and universities recessed for summer is probably
                            not just coincidence. Pak knows US reaction to these moves will be
                            adverse but, encouraged by <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim
                                Chong-p'il</persName>, he believes that US is so committed in Korea
                            that we will have to accept his actions. With enhanced control of the
                            reins of power, we expect that Pak will now press ahead rapidly to try
                            settle with the Japanese in order open up that line of aid and credit.
                            He knows US must under any circumstances provide substantial <gloss target="#t_SA1">SA</gloss>, PL 480 and military assistance, and with
                            this and Japanese contribution he believes he can manage to deal with
                            rising economic difficulties, particularly if US begins go slow on
                            support. However, he probably counts on US desire for <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>-Japan normalization to inhibit our
                            opposition to junta actions.</p>
                        <p>3. Once again the small group that constitutes core of the original
                            revolution have shown their determination to maintain power.
                            Characteristics of this group have in course of last year become more
                            and more apparent. These are:</p>
                        <p>A. A “will to power” and a willingness to be ruthless.</p>
                        <p>B. Frequent rejection of US advice on political matters and tendency to
                            originate and support unsound economic policies.</p>
                        <p>C. Touchy ultra-nationalism and barely concealed anti-Americanism, which
                            manifest themselves openly whenever we oppose a course of action taken
                            by govt or fail to respond as they may wish.</p>
                        <p>D. Continued prominence within the group of political advisors with
                            pro-Communist backgrounds who have extraordinary influence. Despite
                            frequent US objection to these individuals and widespread criticism in
                            Korean Govt and political circles, their influence has not diminished
                            and they play an important role in Democratic-Republican Party.</p>
                        <pb n="654" xml:id="pg_654" facs="0690"/>
                        <p>E. Distrust and disregard of independent civilian political forces and of
                            normal democratic processes.</p>
                        <p>F. Desire to concentrate greater power in hands of narrower leadership
                            group with deliberate elimination of opposing elements within the junta,
                            until in latest move power concentrated almost exclusively in Pak and
                                <persName>Kim</persName> group.</p>
                        <p>4. We believe that military junta under this leadership will continue and
                            intensify the attitudes and actions spelled out above. This likely lead
                            to increasing repression of opposition, proposal of irresponsible
                            economic policies, ever-widening gap between govt and people,
                            accentuation of corrupt practices, and little chance of an election
                            along acceptable lines if an election is held at all.</p>
                        <p>5. Now more clear than ever that junta will do anything necessary to hold
                            power. With this latest drive for maintenance of power, the junta may
                            have added to its problems and may have over-reached itself. The
                            political and economic situation may worsen along following lines:</p>
                        <p>A. In face of prospect of repression and govt's failure to modify
                            rigorous conditions preventing free elections, opposition is seriously
                            considering active boycott elections and will increase anti-govt
                            agitation. Up till now opposition has been weak and divided. More
                            serious efforts to unify will be made.</p>
                        <p>B. Further purges may occur within govt and military to remove or
                            neutralize anti <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim Chong-p'il</persName>
                            elements and those moderates unwilling to go along with hard line. (We
                            have already received reports of possibility further cabinet changes
                            including key figures such as Prime Minister, Chairman Economic Planning
                            Board, and Home Minister.)</p>
                        <p>C. Economic situation will remain difficult. Continued inflationary
                            pressure with danger of further run-down foreign exchange reserves and
                            resultant loss of business confidence may be anticipated.</p>
                        <p>D. Public attitude toward junta will become increasingly hostile in face
                            of mounting political and economic problems.</p>
                        <p>6. If events unfold as now appears likely, we anticipate that we will
                            soon find ourselves unable to support the junta not only because nature
                            these actions is offensive to us, will generate increasing opposition
                            from articulate elements and widen gap between govt and people, but also
                            because their methods of governing do not give promise of avoiding
                            confusion and greater economic and political difficulty.</p>
                        <p>7. We are moving into a period where we must consider what steps we take
                            as this process unfolds. We must also consider the prospects of and the
                            moves toward acceptable alternatives. We propose:</p>
                        <p>A. To guard against a close political identification with junta.</p>
                        <p>B. To constantly emphasize our position on the necessity of free public
                            discussion and fair elections this year.</p>
                        <pb n="655" xml:id="pg_655" facs="0691"/>
                        <p>C. To increasingly associate our economic assistance with our
                            requirements for improved <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss>
                            performance on the economic front and be prepared to withstand the
                            anticipated <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> charges of
                            interference for political reasons and indifference to their economic
                            problems. In the process we should continue to supply essential food
                            requirements and support of military forces.</p>
                        <p>D. To work more closely with opposition elements, especially those which
                            we believe are best suited to our purpose and most responsive to our
                            guidance. Our objective is not to stimulate opposition to overthrow govt
                            by sudden action, but to try to help create opposition to which we can
                            turn as an alternative to junta in any situation that may develop. An
                            opposition is needed in Korea and our influence should be brought to
                            bear as appropriate in order to help in its formation and survival.<note n="2" xml:id="d311fn2">In telegram 78 to Seoul, the Department of
                                State stated that it concurred in the courses of action recommended

                                the opposition, the Embassy should avoid “identifying ourselves with
                                opposition or giving the appearance of seeking overthrow of
                                government.” (Ibid.)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>8. Specific actions should now be taken to make our position clear. As a
                            beginning we should:</p>
                        <p>A. Adhere to decision (of which <persName corresp="#p_KJS1">Killen</persName> has already informed <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss>) to withhold $15 million <gloss target="#t_SA1">SA</gloss> on grounds inadequate implementation stabilization
                            measures until and unless adequate corrective action is taken. On same
                            basis withhold <gloss target="#t_DL1">DL</gloss> approvals.<note n="3" xml:id="d311fn3">In telegram 78 to Seoul, the Department indicated
                                that these recommendations in paragraph A had already been approved.
                                The Department noted that it was attempting to interest the press in
                                Korean developments and that it was replying candidly to press
                                questions without attempting to apologize for or to conceal the
                                junta's deficiencies.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>B. Stimulate US press interest in junta's misdeeds, e.g. stock market
                            scandal, use of torture to extract confessions from defendants in
                            current coup plot trials, and expected repression of press and
                            opposition.</p>
                        <p>C. Use occasion of Foreign Minister's visit to Washington to question him
                            and <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Ambassador Kim Chong-yol closely
                            about govt's political intentions and when govt intends to announce date
                            of elections. They should be asked whether govt intends allow opposition
                            membership in election committees to count ballots and should be told
                            that US considers this essential for fair election. Dept should make
                            clear US opposition to return <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim
                                Chong-p'il</persName> and our attitude toward elections and
                            suppression of opposition or press in light take-over dominant role by
                                <persName>Kim</persName> machine. Subject should also be discussed
                            with Kim Chong-o before he returns to Korea.</p>
                        <p>9. We should work along these lines, recognizing that we will probably
                            elicit a sharp reaction as junta seeks hold power, and that we may reach
                            a point where we can no longer support Pak. There is always possibility
                            of some sudden sharp actions by Korean elements which will bring <pb n="656" xml:id="pg_656" facs="0692"/>about immediate end of junta
                            rule, but resort to intensified police state methods would make this
                            more difficult.</p>
                        <p>10. We offer the above for Dept's consideration and comment. Recommend
                            Tokyo not discuss foregoing analysis of situation with Japanese at this

                        <p>On July 29, 1963, between 5:50 and 6 p.m. local time, an undetermined

                            meeting is printed as <ref target="#d181">Document 181</ref>. According
                            to that record, the President asked “whether the recent military crisis
                            in Korea should be viewed as a isolated incident or as part of a broader
                            military pattern.” Ray Cline of the Central Intelligence Agency stated
                            that “no one could say with certainty,” but General Earle G. Wheeler,

                            noted that similar incidents usually took place during summer. There had
                            been evidence of North Korean violations of the Demilitarized Zone at
                            this time of the year for the past several years. Still, Wheeler could
                            not state that the recent attacks were not part of a larger pattern.

                            Korea, and reported troop movements on the Indian-Tibetan border. The

                            had been danger for years. The United States would carry out its
                            commitments if need be, but the President hoped and believed there would
                            be no need. (<hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the Presidents of the

                        <p>1. Course of events in Korea since mid-July bears out assessment of
                            situation contained reftel. This current review should be read against
                            background analysis reported reftel which remains largely valid.
                            Evidence continues to mount that junta is dominated by hard core
                            elements in <gloss target="#t_SCNR1">SCNR</gloss> and
                            Democratic-Republican Party and that they have extended and deepened
                            their control while moderate elements are being neutralized or
                            eliminated. Pak remains key figure and his association with hard core
                            more confirmed than ever.</p>
                        <p>2. Certain actions planned by hard core have been forestalled,
                            principally by reason of US position. <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim
                                Chong-p'il</persName>'s return appears once again to have been
                            postponed, sweeping cabinet changes temporarily averted, and danger of
                            repression of opposition criticism may have been lessened in short term
                            by US stand taken in Song Yo-chan case. Nevertheless <pb n="658" xml:id="pg_658" facs="0694"/>we remain convinced that hard core is
                            determined perpetuate its power by any means.</p>
                        <p>3. This objective has become more difficult in face increased public
                            criticism of regime, especially in urban areas. Earlier govt hopes for
                            smoothly run elections, with victory for Pak and <gloss target="#t_DRP1">DRP</gloss> through reasonably fair election process, are giving
                            way to apprehension that victory will not be easy. As result junta is
                            now reacting more sharply to criticism, harassing press and other
                            critics and have plans to take even more repressive action to dampen
                            criticism when necessary.</p>
                        <p>4. The dominant group in the junta, operating from a narrower power base,
                            is increasingly preoccupied with internal factional maneuverings and the
                            problem of maintaining power. <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> has been reorganized by hard core
                            elements, re-staffed with <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim
                                Chong-p'il</persName> supporters in key positions, and is now
                            working to reestablish its power over govt and political policy-making.
                            Opposition to the hard core from members of the anti-<persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim Chong-p'il</persName> group who have been
                            ousted from positions of influence, continues to be manifested, but has
                            not been effective nor cohesive.</p>
                        <p>5. Key to Pak remaining in power continues to rest in support of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> military forces. Junta's prestige has
                            doubtless suffered in armed forces over past months. A factor in this
                            has been effect of rising prices on low paid officer and enlisted
                            personnel. However, in absence some explosive situation which would
                            galvanize public opposition (e.g., wholesale election rigging), the
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Armed Forces appear likely
                            remain responsive to junta leadership and senior commanders appear
                            willing to go along with junta plans. Those commanders who show any sign
                            of faltering or opposition will continue to be removed or shifted from
                            key positions.</p>
                        <p>6. Civilian political opposition forces have been making strenuous
                            efforts to unite against regime but continue to suffer badly from old
                            ills of factionalism, personal ambition and short-sightedness. Ability
                            of civilian politicians to organize against junta will be given decisive
                            test during next two weeks. Prospects for effective unity have
                            deteriorated with recent inter-party squabbling and public image of
                            opposition leadership has suffered. With presidential election only
                            about seven weeks away, opposition still has not settled on single
                            candidate and party merger initiatives have been unsuccessful. Funds are
                            short and competition among aspirants for presidency and Assembly strong
                            and possibly even bitter. Moreover, realizing danger presented by
                            opposition united behind single presidential candidate, govt is doing
                            all it can to weaken, divide and harass opposition. Although opposition
                            leaders express confidence that tide is running in their favor, there is
                            no evidence at this time that popular discontent with military govt has
                            been converted into positive <pb n="659" xml:id="pg_659" facs="0695"/>support for opposition. If opposition closes ranks behind single
                            candidate this could change.</p>
                        <p>7. Election campaign will be in full swing in few days. As things heat up
                            regime will intensify efforts to promote Pak's candidacy, and denigrate
                            opposition leaders and their capacity to govern. Govt is counting
                            heavily on bumper rice crop which appears in making to reverse decline
                            in govt's popularity and to create favorable public attitude at election
                            time. A promising crop already doing much to remove the pressure on food
                            prices and the food shortage psychology which have continuously plagued
                            govt since February. Junta will seek to capitalize on Pak's prestige and
                            constructive achievements of past two years while playing down failures.
                            Success in elections will be sought through good party organization, use
                            of govt administrative organs, plentiful funds and use of ordinary
                            powers of govt. If this is not enough, hard core determined to take
                            whatever other measures needed. However, the job today is too divided
                            politically and the opposition too active to predict that resort to
                            repressive measures will not back-fire. Extreme repression on the part
                            of the regime could set off chain reaction of opposition-public
                            defiance, especially in cities.</p>
                        <p>8. Political differences built up over past year have an air of
                            permanence about them which presents us with outlook for protracted
                            period of political struggle. Opposition now has only one purpose in
                            mind, downfall of military govt and junta leadership as soon as
                            possible. If that not possible by means of elections, and many
                            opposition leaders believe junta's policies preclude such possibility,
                            then opposition will lie in wait for whatever occasion or events can
                            speed up the process of change.</p>
                        <p>9. In present circumstances, outlook is for Pak victory but <gloss target="#t_DRP1">DRP</gloss> chances of winning majority in Assembly
                            are poor. With tougher prospects in Assembly elections, junta will be
                            inclined to tougher measures in effort secure majority. A substantial
                            Pak victory could have significant effect on Assembly elections and the
                            interval between presidential and Assembly elections would be used by
                                <gloss target="#t_DRP1">DRP</gloss> to develop more enthusiasm for
                            its candidates.</p>
                        <p>10. Whichever way one looks at the situation, the prospect for emergence
                            stable and effective govt is not apparent:</p>
                        <p>A. A Pak victory with no majority in the Assembly would create a
                            troublesome problem of governing. Normally in such a situation the
                            solution would lie in a coalition, but the hostility and lack of trust
                            on both sides is such that this will not be easy and may not be
                            possible.</p>
                        <p>B. Pak and Govt Party may win majority in Assembly and if the elections
                            were not flagrantly rigged there may be no serious public protest.</p>
                        <p>C. In either above cases, return of <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim
                                Chong-p'il</persName> at some stage is inevitable, and he together
                            with hard core, would dominate govt. This <pb n="660" xml:id="pg_660" facs="0696"/>could produce renewal of fighting within regime between
                            pro and anti-<persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim Chong-p'il</persName>
                            elements.</p>
                        <p>D. If by any outside chance opposition succeeded in presidential and
                            Assembly elections, they would be plagued by internal divisions, and
                            there would be a struggle between civilians and the defeated junta with
                            danger of another coup.</p>
                        <p>11. At this stage of Korea's political development it is too much to
                            expect that any govt could be stable or effective in a Western sense or
                            that economic and political actions would not be sometimes erratic. It
                            remains our judgment that the resolution of Korean political problems
                            should continue to be left primarily to the interplay of domestic
                            political forces. There is not much we can do at the moment to change
                            things without precipitating a sharp upheaval which would not resolve
                            conflict at this stage and might set off chain reaction of disorders. We
                            must be guided by patience and principles; patience to allow Korean
                            dynamics to work out their own solutions; and principles to set limits
                            of behavior as well as targets for achievement. We should avoid
                            interjecting ourselves prematurely into internal political affairs or
                            become too committed to a given solution. We should remain wedded to the
                            principle of fair elections, and assume a critical stance when that
                            principle is threatened.</p>
                        <p>12. There are those in junta who believe US will have to go along with
                            anything which they may do. We have taken pains to prove them wrong on a
                            number of occasions (e.g., currency reform, extension military rule,
                                <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim Chong-p'il</persName>, Song
                            Yo-chan). In future we must be sure to exert immediate pressure when
                            junta moves off course which we consider acceptable. Repressive
                            political actions need to be exposed and criticized, and irresponsible
                            economic policies penalized. We should do this not only because of our
                            natural distaste for repressive or irresponsible actions, but also
                            because our long term interests are not served by US acquiescence in
                            unpopular, unjustified acts. This may increase the risk of open
                            confrontation with junta, which has shown its dissatisfaction when
                            crossed, but we should be prepared ride out any repercussions however
                            sharp.</p>
                        <p>13. In these circumstances we continue believe US policy should be geared
                            to preparing for various possible alternatives in fluid situation. We
                            are still of the opinion expressed in para 7 reftel that US for time
                            being should continue to:</p>
                        <p>A. Guard against a close political identification with junta, while at
                            the same time seeking to influence their actions when these are
                            unacceptable;</p>
                        <p>B. Constantly emphasize our position on necessity free public discussion
                            and fair elections;</p>
                        <p>C. Increasingly associate our economic assistance with our requirements
                            for improved <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> performance on the
                            economic front;</p>

                        <p>D. Maintain a close association with responsible opposition elements and
                            as appropriate use our influence to support development of a viable
                            opposition.</p>
                        <p>E. Maintain a close association and influence with armed forces leaders
                            who in the end may prove to be the arbiters should there be internal
                                upheaval.<note n="2" xml:id="d313fn2">In telegram 206 to Seoul,

                        <p>1. With presidential election campaign entering final week, two of three
                            main opposition candidates have dropped out and Yun Po-son has emerged
                            as only serious challenge to Pak. Opponents of regime are falling in
                            behind him adding to his vote-getting power. This, plus forcefulness of
                            Yun's campaign and large turnouts at his meetings are beginning to worry
                            junta. Opposition efforts so far confined mainly to urban centers, <pb n="662" xml:id="pg_662" facs="0698"/>campaign in rural areas getting
                            underway as speakers fan out in crucial final week.</p>
                        <p>2. Despite substantial hostility to junta, especially in urban areas, and
                            rising interest created by opposition oratory, we still do not
                            characterize situation as “opposition boom.” Facing single major
                            opposition candidate, Pak now running harder than before and still
                            enjoys advantages of money, organization, use of govt administrative
                            apparatus, an assured bumper crop and a solid core of popular
                            support.</p>
                        <p>3. So far govt side has responded with restraint to hard-hitting
                            opposition campaign. Amidst back-room threats of widescale arrests,
                            martial law and election postponement, plus murmurings of assassination
                            possibilities, junta keeping to original election strategy which aims to
                            assure Pak victory in a quiet campaign with minimum of public
                            disturbance. However, signs of growing opposition strength during
                            remaining week could lead junta to change strategy. Concern about
                            outcome of election or civil disturbance could provoke junta to take
                            various actions which would arouse adverse opinion domestically and
                            internationally. Junta's actions so far to harass and hamstring
                            opposition and its abundant funds, far in excess of legal limits, have
                            stretched credibility in fairness of elections. However, despite its
                            handicaps opposition has managed recently to mount a vigorous campaign
                            with Yun Po-son hitting on two main themes that aim to discredit Pak:
                            his Communist past and the allegation that he is unable to command the
                            support and confidence of the US.</p>
                        <p>4. We agree with Dept's view expressed para 3 reftel and to need
                            formulate contingencies and possible lines of action open to US. We
                            tend, however, to formulate such contingencies differently than set
                            forth para 4 reftel.</p>
                        <p>A. On basis present indications we do not believe junta will postpone or
                            cancel presidential election. In discussions with key leaders we have
                            made clear adverse Korean and foreign reaction that would occur and have
                            found no readiness to take such drastic step.</p>
                        <p>B. We do not believe junta will arrest Yun Po-son before presidential
                            election. Consequences such action have also been discussed with govt
                            leaders and to date such hard line has been rejected.</p>
                        <p>5. In our view should contingencies arise in connection with elections
                            they more likely take following form:</p>
                        <p>A. Opposition boom develops and threatens Pak victory. Junta will react
                            by severe repression opposition campaigning and then stuff ballot boxes
                            or falsify count.</p>
                        <p>B. If by some freak junta's plans go awry and opposition wins
                            presidential election, govt would charge election irregularities and
                            seek invalidate result in courts.</p>
                        <pb n="663" xml:id="pg_663" facs="0699"/>
                        <p>C. In addition to, or in place of, legal maneuvering in (B) above, junta
                            would simply declare unwillingness accept unfavorable result and try to
                            continue military govt by decree backed by force of arms.</p>
                        <p>6. We do not believe junta prepared accept defeat even though mindful of
                            consequences of resort to extreme measures (paras 2 and 6 A reftel).
                            They know blatantly rigged election or use of force to maintain power as
                            military govt could set off public reaction but this would not deter
                            them. We have repeatedly made clear to leaders importance we attach to
                            proper conduct of elections and acceptance of election results, but
                            there are those in <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> who believe we
                            have to support Korea whatever they may do.</p>
                        <p>7. Re para 6 reftel, Pak, <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim
                                Chong-p'il</persName> and hard core of junta are not interested in
                            compromise with opposition. The opposition on other hand is completely
                            at odds with junta. While publicly promising abstain from political
                            retaliation, if opposition comes to power, we can expect they will not
                            hesitate to purge revolutionaries.</p>
                        <p>8. If presidential election takes place and Pak can make his victory
                            stick without upheaval, there will still remain the uncertainties in
                            connection with Assembly elections and establishment of govt power
                            within a constitutional frame-work. Opposition will attack Pak victory
                            as rigged and seek arouse public feeling. If serious disturbances occur,
                            junta may be tempted hold off Assembly elections and continue
                            authoritarian rule by an “elected” president. If Assembly elections are
                            held country will go through another bitter campaign, in which govt's
                            chances are not so good and tendency to resort to unfair practices will
                            be even greater. For example junta has threatened arrest and try (after
                            October 15 elections) opposition politicians for “illegal” actions in
                            presidential campaign. This maneuver, if carried out, would inhibit
                            electioneering in Assembly campaign while also removing from field
                            prominent opposition activists.</p>
                        <p>9. Our problem is constantly to weigh acceptability and consequences
                            govt's actions. We may at some time be faced with a clearcut issue,
                            e.g., postponement of elections, martial law, or widescale arrests, and
                            our actions in such cases can be more easily planned. In these
                            circumstances the reactions of Korean people would be discernible and
                            could be taken into account in deciding what actions we should take. We
                            might however be faced with a series of less dramatic actions, no one of
                            which is sharp or drastic enough to create a crisis within Korea or a
                            collision with US, but which cumulatively would produce restiveness in
                            important segments of the population and a generally unhealthy political
                            environment. In such a situation the nature and timing of any decision
                            the US might take would be more difficult to arrive at because it would
                            have no clearcut focal point.</p>
                        <pb n="664" xml:id="pg_664" facs="0700"/>
                        <p>10. We have tended to rely greatly on private advice and carefully
                            weighed public statements to encourage responsible political behavior in
                            hope of building a more or less stable government structure in the wake
                            of revolution. We have also counted on the rise of political forces
                            within the Korean context which could take care of problems without
                            overly active US intervention. While we must continue to rely on advice
                            and official comments in dealing with or seeking to prevent
                            contingencies of the sort laid out in the preceding discussion, such
                            expressions may not be sufficient. We accept the lines of action
                            proposed by Dept in paras 4, 5, and 6 of reftel and in fact have been
                            following those courses as appropriate. However, in certain
                            contingencies, we believe that more fundamental decisions may need to be
                            taken.</p>
                        <p>11. The lines of action proposed by Dept in reftel are in nature of US
                            reactions to a set of possible extreme measures by junta which we would
                            find undesirable, which would confirm that US unable to deal with junta
                            except on latter's own terms, and which probably would be unacceptable
                            to a substantial proportion if not a majority of the Korean public. We
                            would therefore be setting the US in opposition to the junta, and in
                            effect instituting a course of action which could have either of two
                            basic objectives:</p>
                        <p>A. To force a change in junta policy to one which would be acceptable to
                            us and suitable to local situation;</p>
                        <p>B. To begin process of withdrawing support from junta with purpose of
                            replacing it with an acceptable govt.</p>
                        <p>Either of these objectives would call forth actions and counteractions
                            involving the full range of complex relations and strategic interests
                            which face US in Korea.</p>
                        <p>12. Alternative A above is not as harsh or difficult as alternative B,
                            but if faced with intransigence on the part of the junta and a rising
                            tide of public hostility to junta inside Korea it might inevitably lead
                            to alternative B. We would need, therefore, to consider carefully the
                            ultimate objectives we would have in mind and weigh the consequences,
                            risks and alternatives. In dealing with various contingencies it is
                            difficult to decide at what stage it is prudent as well as possible to
                            move from the mild to the more drastic courses. No complete answer can
                            be given in advance of events and the way in which situation
                            develops.</p>
                        <p>13. We would welcome Dept's comments on foregoing soonest. We also urge
                            that in event contingencies of sort feared arise, there be close
                            consultation and coordination prior to development our position or any
                            public statement. While fully aware of possible need for quick US
                            reaction, we believe such reaction should not be automatic but should
                            develop in light of actual events and be based upon deliberate and
                            recognized objectives.</p>

                        <p>515. 1. Election returns have astonished all observers.<note n="1" xml:id="d315fn1">The final total vote count was: Pak Chung-hui,
                                4,702,640; Yun Po-sun, 4,546,614; three other minor candidates, a

                            While it is true opposition gained on Pak in last week, extent of vote
                            for Yun, especially in armed forces, generally remarkable. Equally
                            remarkable, and to surprise everyone (including Embassy), was junta's
                            apparent willingness to take chance of free balloting. That it may have
                            been overconfident is true, but nevertheless by conscious decision govt
                            did its best insure an orderly election day and efficient conduct of

                            probable future consequences. It is a little too soon for that, and we
                            want to watch a few days to see popular and organized political
                                reaction.<note n="2" xml:id="d315fn2">The Embassy sent a long

                                (Ibid.)</note> At this point, however, it is clear that Pak did not
                            achieve decisive victory which he expected. Yun's hard-hitting personal
                            campaign attacks took their toll, but dissatisfaction with military govt
                            on economic and political grounds and with its style of governing, and
                            was more fundamental. Much of Yun's vote was not so much pro-Yun as
                            anti-military govt. The opposition vote was registered in face of a govt
                            machine which had money and organization. Pak won a personal victory but
                            his opponents have a moral victory and with it perhaps a new sense of
                            confidence which they may use to their advantage in the future.</p>
                        <p>3. Our preliminary evaluation of the vote count runs like this. Pak's
                            ability to hold Yun to a surprise draw in Pusan, rack up a big majority
                            in his home Kyongsang provinces and overturn Yun's hopes in normally
                            opposition Cholla provinces carried the day. A decisive factor in
                            holding down Yun's vote was the 800,000 odd votes picked up by the three
                            minor candidates. Undoubtedly a majority of these would otherwise have
                            gone to Yun and would have made the difference between defeat and
                            victory.</p>
                        <p>4. Another factor significance of which we not able yet judge is the
                            large number of invalid votes and their locale. Vote tallies as
                            announced so far do not provide the necessary statistics evaluate this
                            element. What data we have show large numbers of invalid votes (perhaps
                            as many as one million) particularly in areas where Yun ran strong.
                            These may be votes cast for Song Yo-chan in addition to ballot otherwise
                            spoiled but <pb n="666" xml:id="pg_666" facs="0702"/>that is only
                            speculation. We will have to await opposition and press initiatives to
                            probe this. If spoilage is overwhelmingly and disproportionately large
                            in Yun strongholds, the opposition will have something critical to
                            say.</p>
                        <p>5. So far opposition comment on Pak's vote in Pusan is surprise [garble]
                            with snide reference to power failure when vote counting [garble]. Pak's
                            vote in the Chollas is being attributed to strong campaigning by the
                                <gloss target="#t_DRP1">DRP</gloss> with plenty of money and liberal
                            use of govt favors in an area where the govt knew Pak might have
                            trouble.</p>
                        <p>6. More than anything the military vote will be debated back and forth.
                            It was not rigged, that is sure. That it favored Yun is also sure.
                            Inflationary pressure and consequent discontent help to explain it.</p>
                        <p>7. We do not know how either junta or the opposition will react in the
                            immediate future. Pak's first reaction has been statesmanlike and
                            moderate. Some of his associates have not been as forthright. That Pak
                            did not win either outright majority or sizeable margin over his nearest
                            opponent may have restraining effect on junta's actions. An important
                            test in next few days will be how govt behaves toward election and
                            “violators.”</p>
                        <p> Pak reaffirmed in post-election statement he intends no retaliation.</p>
                        <p>8. Opposition has said very little so far about election, preliminary
                            statements moderate. Too early to say if this will last.</p>
                        <p>9. Both we and <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> face difficult few
                            days followed by period uncertainty until Assembly elections over.
                            However, country appears have taken a major step, in which it might
                            easily have stumbled, towards transfer to civil govt. We will do an
                            assessment of the outlook as soon as we can draw a fine bead.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>1. Following are some preliminary views on post-election scene and
                            implications for our policies. Your comments invited.</p>
                        <p>2. Democratic election was held in orderly manner. Flagrant repression
                            and wholesale rigging which we feared did not occur. U.S. posture of
                            neutrality regarding presidential candidates appears to be well
                            established publicly. For these and other beneficial developments
                            referred to below credit is due in large part to effective efforts of
                            Embassy. You and your staff are warmly commended.</p>
                        <p>3. Although narrow Pak victory with less than majority of valid votes was
                            unexpected and creates complex political situation, situation has
                            certain compensations from our viewpoint. Had Pak secured strong popular
                            mandate, he could more easily justify repressive trends set forth para 3
                            reftel B than he can as plurality victor. Had opposition won,
                            particularly by narrow margin, there would have been period of
                            widespread uncertainty, instability, and possibly violence as it sought
                            to establish its authority.</p>
                        <p>4. Our preliminary and tentative interpretation of election is that
                            opposition won moral victory. Even without evaluating high number
                            invalid votes, it seems clear that genuine support for Chairman Pak was
                            relatively narrow. Vote for opposition in certain military areas makes
                            apparent that support for junta within military cannot now be taken for
                            granted.</p>
                        <p>5. We are encouraged by talk of moderation on both sides, but especially
                            with <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim Chong-p'il</persName> returning
                            there is danger of his baleful repressive influence being reflected in
                            government actions. Beginning of Assembly elections probably will
                            regenerate political controversy, with at least temporary impairment of
                            atmosphere of moderation and cooperation. Our preliminary guess is that
                            Democratic-Republican Party is unlikely win majority of constituencies
                            in Assembly although it could <pb n="668" xml:id="pg_668" facs="0704"/>gain majority of seats as consequence of new proportional
                            representation system. Assembly election seems unlikely to have any
                            marked effect on present political balance of power.</p>
                        <p>6. We believe paras 7 A, B, C, and D reftel B still afford sound guidance
                            for U.S. policy, despite some changes in situation. Strength of
                            opposition vote underlines importance of 7 A and 7 D. Need for pressing
                            for freedom of elections (para 7 B) still pertinent with respect to
                            Assembly elections, especially in view return of <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim Chong-p'il</persName> to scene. Linkage of
                            assistance with Korean performance (para 7 C) remains essential. We
                            believe these policies are becoming well understood at present in Korea,
                            largely as result of Embassy-<gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss>
                            steadfast adherence to them.</p>
                        <p>7. We suggest three special points of emphases at this juncture:</p>
                        <p>A. Encouragement of moderation, tolerance, and cooperation on part of
                            both government and opposition. Although we must recognize need for
                            continued political conflict and should not help <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> subvert opposition in guise of
                            developing cooperation, we should endeavor to move their political
                            dialogue into constructive channels. To this end, we should consult with
                            opposition as well as government on such problems as Korean-Japanese
                            normalization of relations, and economic stabilization.</p>
                        <p>B. Encouragement of Pak to make best selections possible for cabinet and
                            other key positions on basis of competence and of promoting national
                            interests. We should work to establish authority and responsibility in
                            cabinet and ministries rather than continued behind-scenes activities.
                            Canadian grain purchase could be made case in point. We should also
                            refuse help Korean activities in which Korean <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> improperly involved.</p>
                        <p>C. Renewed focus on threat of <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim
                                Chong-p'il</persName> and his supporters in government. We hope that
                            his prolonged absence from Korea, opposition's show of strong popular
                            support, and our cold-shoulder treatment may have impaired his political
                            strength in Korea. We strongly question, however, whether he has
                            changed, and regard him as still a dangerous unstabilizing force. In
                            working to counter him, Embassy could truthfully say that Dept has
                            received many inquiries about scandal cases, including quite a few from
                            Congress.</p>
                        <p>8. At appropriate occasion in course of coming week <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> proposes publicly to refer to
                            orderly conduct of election and encouraging post-election
                            developments.</p>

                                restructuring of U.S. forces in Korea. U.S. forces would also be

                            previous work that was accomplished last summer. In order to do the
                            thorough job required for a decision by the President on this important

                            the Far Eastern area, I would hope that we could have until the middle

                            which has been hanging fire for so long; and in this connection I assume
                            that State will want to consider not only how to convey to the Koreans
                            the rationale for the suggested force reductions, but would also want to
                            formulate a diplomatic plan for achieving an <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>-Japanese peace treaty in the very near future. This is
                            especially important in light of the economic impact of a U.S. force
                            reduction and the diminished funds we will have available for economic

                                <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> 41-63, October 9, 1963, reached
                                largely similar conclusions regarding Japan: The outlook for
                                continued political stability appeared favorable. The economy, while
                                growing rapidly, was “exceptionally vulnerable to threats to its
                                export markets.” Although the economy would continue to expand, it
                                would probably not be “at the remarkable rate of recent years.” The
                                Security Treaty would remain the “keystone” of Japan's defense and
                                military planning, but the Japanese would be “particularly edgy
                                about their use in connection with hostilities which Japan did not
                                see as an immediate threat to itself.” <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> 41-63 placed greater emphasis than its predecessor
                                on an expected increase in Japanese international assertiveness.

                        <p>1. Although Japan will almost certainly remain aligned with the US over
                            the next year or so, it will continue slowly to grow more assertive of
                                <pb n="675" xml:id="pg_675" facs="0711"/>its own independent
                            interests and more active in world affairs. The conservative elements
                            will almost certainly continue to control Japanese governments for the
                            foreseeable future and <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> will
                            probably retain the Premiership for the next year, at least. Japan's
                            economy will probably continue to expand at a rapid rate although it
                            will remain sensitive to adverse actions abroad beyond the control of
                            the Japanese. (Paras. 15-22)</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> will almost certainly have
                            his hands full coping with dissension within his party and with an
                            irresponsible and increasingly aggressive opposition in the Diet.
                            Consequently, he will probably exercise extreme caution in dealing with
                            sensitive domestic or foreign policy issues and will emphasize domestic
                            economic measures of popular appeal to the Japanese. He will seek to
                            avoid accusations of highhandedness or subservience to foreign
                            pressures. (Para. 16)</p>
                        <p>3. Pacifist and neutralist sentiment, born of Japan's [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] fear of
                            involvement in another war, will almost certainly continue to influence
                            the government's execution of its pro-Western policies. In addition,
                            there will probably be strong domestic pressures for the regularization
                            of Japanese relations with Communist China. However, if the US maintains
                            its opposition to recognition of Communist China, the <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> government probably will not take
                            any serious steps in this direction. (Paras. 23-27)</p>
                        <p>4. The Left will seize any opportunity to agitate the public and to
                            maintain pressure upon the Japanese Government to obstruct effective
                            implementation of the US-Japan security arrangements. In most
                            circumstances, the Ikeda government will probably take fairly vigorous
                            steps to oppose leftist efforts to obstruct operation of the US bases.

                            addition, the utility of the bases would almost certainly be impaired by
                            leftist mass demonstrations and labor boycotts, and possibly by
                                sabotage.<note n="2" xml:id="d324fn2">The Director of Intelligence

                        <p>From May 29 through June 30, 1961, Japanese and U.S. delegations met in
                            Washington to negotiate a Japanese request that Japan Air Lines be
                            allowed a route Japan/Honolulu/San Francisco/New York “and beyond.”
                            After the United States refused to grant this request, Japan asked for a
                            similar route via Seattle instead of San Francisco. The United States
                            countered with the offer of a polar route from Japan to New York
                            provided certain existing routes were modified. Japan was willing to
                            negotiate on this basis provided the United States granted the polar
                            route to New York “and beyond.” Upon U.S. refusal to concur with the
                            request for the right to fly “beyond” New York, the delegations agreed
                            to recess the talks “until an appropriate date in the near future.”

                            “rights such as we are now discussing,” pointed out the President “had

                            United States air lines because it would be disadvantageous to Japan,”
                            and declined to be drawn into detailed discussion on the subject on the
                            ground the formal negotiations were the proper channel. (Memorandum of

                            Japanese doubts about the importance we attach to Japan as compared with
                            our major allies in Europe, as well as Japanese doubts about the
                            relative weight we give to our economic relationship as opposed to our
                            military security relationship. I believe the establishment of a joint
                            committee on the United States-Canadian pattern will do a great deal to
                            accomplish these objectives by giving public recognition to the
                            importance we attach to close and mutually beneficial trade and economic
                            relations. It would also be a logical development in view of Article II
                            of the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United
                            States and Japan in which the two Governments agree that “They will seek
                            to eliminate conflict in their international economic policies and will
                            encourage economic collaboration between them.” We believe the Committee
                            would also serve the following specific purposes:</p>
                        <p>1. It would provide a medium, now lacking, for periodic high level
                            economic discussions with our second largest trading partner.</p>
                        <p>2. It would counteract the Japanese impression that their economic
                            interests are overshadowed in U.S. policy determination as a result of
                            our close ties with our Western European allies and the forums provided
                            by these close ties in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> for regular high level discussions
                            within the Atlantic Community.</p>
                        <p>3. It would provide an interim organ for the discussion of economic and
                            trade problems of mutual interest as long as Japan is not a full member
                            of <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss>.</p>
                        <pb n="679" xml:id="pg_679" facs="0715"/>
                        <p>4. It would permit an annual high level review of economic development
                            questions, particularly such joint programs as may be developed for
                            Korea and other areas.</p>
                        <p>The proposal has been discussed with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_REO1">Reischauer</persName>, who considers it a most
                            constructive step. It has also been discussed with other interested
                            Departments (Treasury, Interior, Agriculture, Commerce, and Labor). They
                            have approved the establishment of the Committee, subject to your
                            approval. The Secretaries of the Interior and Labor<note n="1" xml:id="d329fn1"> Stewart Udall and Arthur Goldberg.</note> are not
                            regular members of the United States-Canadian Committee, but have
                            expressed a strong desire to participate in the United States-Japan
                            Committee. I accordingly recommend that you authorize me to conclude an
                            agreement with the Government of Japan along the lines of the enclosed
                            draft notes.</p>
                        <p>We would hope to conclude an agreement establishing this Committee on the
                            occasion of Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName>'s
                            visit, June 20-23, 1961. I would propose to exchange notes without

                            Foreign Minister during the visit. The establishment of the Committee
                            would be announced in your joint communique with Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> and the notes published

                        <p>The President, in opening the discussion of Communist China, said that
                            the problem of Communist China, and particularly the United Nations
                            aspects of this issue, is a matter of concern on which we wish the Prime
                            Minister's opinion. He added that he understands the Japanese do not
                            believe the moratorium procedure would be successful at the next United
                            Nations General Assembly. He said that the handling of the Chinese
                            representation to the United Nations seriously concerns the United
                            States since we wish to assure that the Chinese Communists do not gain
                            U.N. membership while the Republic of China does not lose its
                            membership. <pb n="681" xml:id="pg_681" facs="0717"/>We are particularly
                            anxious, he said, for the Japanese views on this problem.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that China posed a difficult problem for Japan
                            since there are strong feelings in Japan on this issue. Unlike the
                            United States, the Japanese people feel a sense of kinship to Mainland
                            China due to geographic propinquity, long historical ties, and a sense
                            of guilt regarding the last war. Furthermore, many Japanese consider it
                            unrealistic to keep a country with 600 million people out of the U.N.
                            The Prime Minister pointed out, however, that this viewpoint does not
                            mean that public opinion favors recognition of Communist China. Public
                            opinion is not, in fact, unified on the recognition question. First,
                            Japan has a peace treaty with the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>.
                            Secondly, there is a strong feeling in Japan that Taiwan must be held by
                            the Free World and under no circumstances returned to Communist China.
                            The Japanese, the Prime Minister explained, feel assured regarding the
                            stability and safety of Taiwan so long as Chiang Kai-shek is in control.
                            They are most anxious, however, about what will happen after Chiang dies
                            since they do not trust his son, Chiang Ching-kuo, due to the nature of
                            his background and character. Further, out of the 9 million people on
                            Taiwan, 7 million are native Formosans who cherish freedom and
                            independence and whose desires should not be ignored. The Prime Minister
                            concluded that it may not be proper to seek a solution to the problem of
                            Chinese Communist admission to the U.N. before taking action on the
                            broader Taiwan question and securing this area for the Free World. He
                            thought most Free World countries would agree on this approach. Further,
                            since both Chinas insist on a “One China” policy, the Chinese Communists
                            would not come into the U.N. if we secure Taiwan now.</p>
                        <p>The President told the Prime Minister that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> in Vienna had informed him of Chinese
                            Communist unwillingness to enter the United Nations if the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> remains a member. This has continually
                            been the Chinese Communist line. He felt, however, that it is difficult
                            to agree on a formula which appears to indicate a willingness to take
                            Communist China into the U.N. and to embrace in effect a “Two-China”
                            policy. This will require a great deal of work in order to reach the
                            right conclusion.</p>
                        <p>The President emphasized that the Chinese representation question posed a
                            particularly difficult problem for the United States since there is a
                            great deal of emotional interest in this problem among the American
                            people and there are also very strong feelings in Congress on this
                            issue. He said that it was difficult for us to enter into a maneuver in
                            which the U.S. appears to be willing to accept Chinese Communist entry
                            into the United Nations since this is perhaps the most sensitive foreign
                            policy issue in the United States. He suggested that the Secretary
                            discuss the details of the China representation question with the
                            Foreign Minister and attempt to reach a more precise understanding with
                            the Japanese <pb n="682" xml:id="pg_682" facs="0718"/>Government before
                            the Prime Minister's departure. Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> agreed and said that he understood
                            the feeling of the United States on this issue quite well.<note n="1" xml:id="d330fn1">In a discussion of Chinese issues that afternoon,
                                    <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and Foreign Minister
                                Kosaka agreed that recognition of the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> was not contemplated by either country, but that
                                the U.N. representation issue was crucial. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> stated that the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> needed to acquire more tactical
                                flexibility to retain its seat. Kosaka advised that the question of
                                Chinese Security Council membership should be divorced from General
                                Assembly discussion of Chinese representation and that “the status
                                of the Taiwan Government should be limited to only the areas under
                                its control. For Japan, the crux of the problem is keeping Taiwan
                                free from Chinese Communist control.” <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> stressed that he hoped a new formula on U.N.
                                representation could develop through multilateral discussion.

                        <p>The Secretary called on Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> to speak on the subject of the United States
                            balance of payments. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> opened his remarks by stating that he would like
                            to associate himself with the statement made earlier by Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> about the <gloss target="#t_GARIOA1">GARIOA</gloss> settlement.<note n="1" xml:id="d331fn1">After the Prime Minister expressed appreciation for
                                the <gloss target="#t_GARIOA1">GARIOA</gloss> settlement, which had
                                been initialed in Tokyo on June 9, <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> stated that the United States had been very
                                satisfied with the settlement and planned to use some of the
                                proceeds for financing aid to less developed counties. See <ref target="#d353">Document 353</ref>.</note> He expressed great
                            pleasure that a mutually satisfactory settlement of this difficult and
                            vexing problem had been reached.</p>
                        <p>Turning to the United States balance of payments situation, Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> noted that there has
                            been a considerable improvement in the first few months of this year,
                            the upturn having begun late last year. For the past three years there
                            have been very substantial deficits; for 1960 the figure was $3.8
                            billion. However, an analysis of this figure discloses that there was a
                            great improvement in the basic trade deficit, from $4 billion in 1959 to
                            $1.9 billion in 1960; the remaining $1.9 billion in 1960 was the result
                            of short term capital movements.</p>
                        <p>In the first quarter of 1961 the overall deficit was at the annual rate
                            of $1.2 billion, made up of a deficit from short term capital movements
                            at an annual rate of $1.9 billion (identical to 1960) and a surplus in
                            the basic trade account at an annual rate of $700 million (compared with
                            the 1960 figure of $1.9 billion).</p>
                        <p>Several points should be made about these figures. The surplus in the
                            basic account is not as favorable as it appears. It is largely the
                            result of a decline in imports due to our business recession which
                            reached the low point of the cycle during the first quarter. Imports
                            (annual rate) were $1.3 billion less than last year. Thus, if imports
                            had equalled those of last year, the basic trade account would show a
                            deficit of $600 million (annual rate) instead of a surplus of $700
                            million. The business upswing has now begun and we should begin to see
                            higher import levels in the fall. We expect that they will return to the
                            December 1959 level which was $2 billion <pb n="684" xml:id="pg_684" facs="0720"/>over the level of the first quarter of 1961. This level
                            of imports would create a deficit in the basic trading account of about
                            $1.25 billion.</p>
                        <p>While our imports have been temporarily low because of the business
                            recession in the United States, the economies of Europe and Japan have
                            been booming and our exports have been good. We hope this will continue.
                            On the other hand, the temporary drop in our import level should soon be
                            corrected and this will produce a continued imbalance in our
                            international payments. We therefore believe we must continue with the
                            President's program to preserve a reasonable balance in our
                            international payments, for such a balance is essential to the
                            maintenance of the value of the dollar.</p>
                        <p>Looking to the future, we hope, by carrying out the President's program,
                            to reduce our out-payments by $1 billion to $1.5 billion. At the same
                            time we expect our commercial imports will increase by about $2 billion
                            so that the other trading nations of the world will not be hurt by our
                            reduced out-payments under the President's program.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the short term capital flow, the rate of the outflow for
                            the first quarter of 1961 was the same as for the whole of 1960, but was
                            much less than the very high rate reached last fall. This year the
                            components of the short term capital outflow are also different. Last
                            year there was a combination of substantial capital outflows for
                            business reasons, such as the search for higher interest rates, plus
                            large speculative outflows. The latter have all but disappeared, but the
                            outflow for business reasons continued during the first quarter of 1961
                            at approximately the same level as 1960.</p>
                        <p>The short term capital outflow in the first quarter of 1961 had some
                            interesting aspects. The largest amount went to Japan as financing for
                            Japanese imports from the United States. The next largest amount went to
                            Germany, where German businessmen were borrowing dollars in New York as
                            a hedge against a possible further revaluation of the German mark. (We
                            do not think the Germans will reevaluate the mark again.) Because of
                            these special factors, we think the short term capital outflow situation
                            during the first quarter of 1961 is better than it appears on the
                            surface. Greater confidence is also being shown in the value of the
                            dollar. There has been a net gold inflow of more than $100 million since
                            February.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> expressed his
                            appreciation for Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>'s analysis of the balance of payments situation. He
                            had watched the situation very closely and considered that it was no
                            longer a cause for great concern. On the Japanese side, gold and dollar
                            reserves have been built up to about $2 billion but there have been
                            deficits on merchandise account of about $600 million so far this year.
                            This is a matter of considerable concern and is a question which the
                            Japanese view as a real test for the <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> Cabinet. The Prime Minister said he anticipated
                            that business <pb n="685" xml:id="pg_685" facs="0721"/>conditions would
                            improve in the United States in the second half of 1961 and expected
                            that Japan's situation would be helped by substantially greater United
                            States imports from Japan later this year. He expressed the hope that
                            the United States could assist Japan in balancing its payments by
                            continuing to make purchases in Japan from <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> funds.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> noted that
                            there are two primary reasons for the imbalance in the Japanese payments
                            situation. First, Japan has liberalized the importation of cotton and
                            wool, and purchases of these commodities have increased considerably.
                            Second, as a result of Japan's trade liberalization program, Japanese
                            manufacturers feel they must improve the productivity of their plants by
                            importing large quantities of expensive industrial equipment. Japan is
                            devoting 20 percent of its <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss> to
                            capital investment. It needs this high rate of investment because it is
                            the least developed of the well-developed countries. The rising imports
                            are not for luxury goods but for raw materials and a greatly increased
                            quantity of industrial machinery. Most of this machinery is being bought
                            in the United States.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary said that we would appreciate the observations of the Prime
                            Minister regarding Japan's plans to liberalize its trade and payments
                            restrictions. The United States has a very lively interest in this
                            problem as do other countries. We recognize that trade liberalization
                            becomes involved in domestic political problems in the United States and
                            perhaps likewise in Japan. In the United States, exporters tend to take
                            for granted their export markets and are not politically vocal. On the
                                <pb n="686" xml:id="pg_686" facs="0722"/>other hand, those
                            manufacturers affected by imports become politically vocal, creating
                            difficult domestic problems for trading countries such as the United
                            States. The Secretary said that we feel Japan's trade policies are
                            somewhat restrictive and hope that the Prime Minister might comment on
                            the possibility of greater liberalization.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> said that
                            there is considerable opposition to liberalization from certain segments
                            of Japan industry. Nevertheless, two years ago, when he was Minister of
                            International Trade and Industry, he insisted upon undertaking
                            liberalization of trade and payments so that the Japanese economy could
                            stand on its own feet. Japan now plans virtually full liberalization by
                            1963. This target takes into account that some industries are well
                            developed, while others, such as the automobile industry, are lagging
                            behind. The Prime Minister thought that by 1963 Japanese industry as a
                            whole would be prepared for liberalization.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary commented that the trade liberalization question is very
                            timely for the U.S. Next year, Congress will consider the renewal of
                            U.S. trade legislation. There has been a steady increase in
                            protectionist pressures in the U.S., the Secretary explained, due to
                            several internal economic factors: (1) the movement of industry into
                            traditional free trade areas of the United States; and (2) the growing
                            pressure for protection on the part of the trade union movement due to
                            fears of unemployment resulting from imports. Opponents of liberal trade
                            legislation are seeking every possible rationalization for defeating
                            renewal of our current trade agreements legislation. In particular, they
                            are canvassing the positions of other governments with a view to using
                            foreign efforts to restrict imports from the U.S. to support opposition
                            to liberal U.S. trade legislation. The Secretary concluded that this is
                            a matter of real concern to us and that we would appreciate anything the
                            Prime Minister can do to accelerate Japanese trade liberalization.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> commented that, as the
                            Prime Minister recognized, Japan had a greater number of quantitative
                            restrictions on imports than any major trading country. The U.S., he
                            said, is doing its best to persuade other nations not to invoke <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> Article 35<note n="1" xml:id="d332fn1">For text of the Protocol of Provisional Application
                                of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, signed at Geneva
                                October 30, 1947, see TIAS 1700 (two volumes), or 61 Stat. (pts. 5
                                and 6). Article XXXV provides for non-application of the Agreement
                                between particular contracting parties.</note> against Japan. We are
                            basically seeking to create an international trading system in which
                            most favored nation treatment is accorded all countries and there are no
                            quantitative restrictions against imports. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> pointed out that the items
                            liberalized by Japan are mostly agricultural products and U.S.
                            manufacturing interests have complained about restrictions against their
                            products. We hope, therefore, with the general upswing in the Japanese
                            balance of payments and the increase in their reserves, Japan will see
                            its <pb n="687" xml:id="pg_687" facs="0723"/>way clear to accelerate the
                            pace of its liberalization program and go fairly far to full
                            liberalization by the end of 1961.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> replied that
                            invocation of <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> Article 35 creates
                            problems for Japan in trade liberalization. In addition, there are
                            domestic problems since 40 per cent of population is employed in the
                            agricultural sector where productivity is low. There are also many small
                            and medium-sized industries with low productivity. Nevertheless, Japan
                            intends to accelerate its liberalization program to achieve 90 per cent
                            liberalization by 1963.<note n="2" xml:id="d332fn2">In a further
                                discussion of this subject the morning of June 21, Foreign Minister
                                Kosaka stated that U.S. protectionist measures such as those then
                                contemplated on tile and glass made trade liberalization more
                                difficult for Japan, and he pointed out that the United States had a
                                favorable merchandise trade balance of some $5 billion yearly.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> responded that
                                although protectionist pressures had risen in the United States
                                since the immediate postwar period, there was no question as to the
                                policy the United States wished to pursue. (Department of State,

                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> pointed out
                            that Japan has a system of voluntary controls over exports to the U.S.,
                            including textiles. Forty per cent of the goods exported to the United
                            States are now under the voluntary control system. In 1957, the Japanese
                            undertook the textile control program in good faith. However, the
                            Japanese share of textiles imported into the United States declined from
                            75 per cent in 1957 to 18 per cent at the present time. Meanwhile, as a
                            result of the self-control exercised by <pb n="688" xml:id="pg_688" facs="0724"/>Japan, other countries expanded their textile exports
                            to the United States. The Prime Minister stressed that Japan was
                            concerned not only by the textile problem per se, but by the fear that
                            the same process could occur with respect to other items presently under
                            voluntary control by Japan. Japan does not wish to create a situation
                            whereby the application of self-control in good faith results in a loss
                            of United States markets to other countries. It hopes this situation can
                            be borne in mind during the multilateral textile discussions.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> replied that the United
                            States fully appreciates the unfairness of the situation created by
                            Japanese self restraint in the textile field which has permitted other
                            producing areas, particularly Hong Kong, to increase their imports into
                            the United States to the point where Hong Kong's imports are now greater
                            than Japan's. This situation is the major factor underlying our recent
                            proposal for a multilateral agreement.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said that there were a
                            number of elements and considerations involved in the United States
                            initiative for a multilateral textile arrangement. First, we wish to use
                            as much pressure as possible against the nations invoking <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> Article 35 against Japan's textiles
                            or placing severe quantitative restrictions against Japanese textiles.
                            We desire to persuade these countries to accept Japanese textiles
                            without restriction. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>
                            mentioned that the United States is meeting tomorrow for two or three
                            days with representatives of the seven principal importing countries:
                            the United Kingdom, Canada, France, Italy, West Germany, Belgium, and
                            the Netherlands. In this meeting we will seek an agreement that all
                            nations should accept textiles at an increasing rate on the basis of a
                            certain, still not decided, percentage of domestic consumption.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said that the second step
                            in our multilateral approach is to bring together the major producing
                            and consuming nations. The <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> Council
                            has accepted in principle a meeting of these nations to be called by the
                            Secretary General of <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>. At this
                            meeting, we hope to reach an understanding calling for acceptance of
                            textiles by the consuming nations under agreed limits.<note n="1" xml:id="d333fn1">See <ref target="#d371fn2">footnote 2, Document
                                    371</ref>.</note> We hope the producing nations will agree on
                            these limits as well. In fixing the limits for the United States, we
                            intend to take into account the helpful self-restraints imposed by Japan
                            during the last few years. The third element in the multilateral
                            arrangement is a formula for annual increases of imports into consuming
                            nations. The fourth element would be steps to prevent circumventing the
                            agreement by the substitution of other fibers. The fifth element would
                            be measures to limit imports from producing nations not parties to the
                            agreement.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> concluded that we are
                            seeking in the multilateral arrangement full protection for Japan
                            against the situation created by the unilateral <pb n="689" xml:id="pg_689" facs="0725"/>Japanese voluntary control system. We
                            are seeking increased imports of textiles but in a manner designed to
                            avoid market disruption. Basically, the United States wishes to bring
                            rationality and order into the international cotton and textile market.
                            The Secretary concluded that we believe the record demonstrates that
                            Japan has earned real consideration. He recalled that President
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> had made this point
                            to the Japanese Economic Mission and that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Asakai</persName> had made a very effective case in
                            his conversations with the Department. Nevertheless, there are limits
                            due to political factors as to what the United States can do. The
                            Secretary said that we will do what we can and suggested that Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> and the Japanese discuss
                            how best we can proceed. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>
                            expressed the hope that the Japanese Government could give us full
                            support in the multilateral textile discussions.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister expressed his appreciation for our frank discussion of
                            the textile problem. He said the textile industry is a central industry
                            in Japan and also the industry most friendly to the United States. He
                            felt that he had not, until the discussions with the Secretary,
                            understood the deep consideration given to the Japanese problem by the
                            United States in the formulation of its plans for a multilateral
                            arrangement. He assured the Secretary that Japan, in the interest of
                            free trade, would cooperate fully with the United States.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he wished to raise the possibility of visits to
                            Japan by Nautilus-type nuclear-powered submarines. The submarines are
                            engaged in long cruises and it would be helpful if they could visit
                            Japan occasionally for crew rest and provisioning. The United States
                            recognizes the sensitivity of this issue to Japan but these vessels have
                            nuclear power plants as differentiated from the Polaris-type submarines.
                            He asked whether the visit of nuclear-powered submarines would create
                            much of a problem for Japan.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said that while the Japanese people support peaceful
                            uses of atomic energy, they are behind the times both technically <pb n="691" xml:id="pg_691" facs="0727"/>and in understanding of the
                            problem. The public still tends to relate anything atomic to nuclear
                            weapons and thereby to the possibility of involvement in a nuclear war.
                            The Japanese Government would therefore like to give further study to
                            this problem before agreeing to the visits of nuclear-powered
                            submarines.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that we would return to this question at some future
                            time. He felt that the key to the problem is gaining greater public
                            familiarity with the normal uses of nuclear energy, as distinct from
                            nuclear weapons, by demonstrating the potential of nuclear power plants
                            in ships. We hope eventually nuclear-powered vessels, including
                            submarines, would be accepted in Japan.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said that the Japanese Government could well
                            understand the desirability of inviting nuclear-powered submarines to
                            Japan. However, in all frankness, he felt that considerable groundwork
                            must be laid first among the public. At present, public opinion is not
                            sufficiently aware of the potential uses of atomic energy; and there is
                            also a lack of understanding in the Japan Science Council which has
                            close ties to the left. At present, there is certain to be a great deal
                            of opposition to almost any step relating to atomic energy, including a
                            visit by nuclear-powered submarines. He said that it was a matter of
                            timing and method in Japan so that a situation could be created publicly
                            whereby United States proposals on such subjects would be acceptable.
                            The Secretary said that we would be in touch with the Japanese
                            Government again on the problem.<note n="1" xml:id="d334fn1">At the

                        </list>
                        <p>The Prime Minister advanced the request that the United States undertake
                            to establish with the Japanese in Asia a relationship similar to that
                            enjoyed by Britain, under which the two Governments consult continuously
                            on foreign policy problems of common concern.</p>
                        <p>The President noted that the United States does indeed prize her good
                            relations with Japan, especially since she and India play such
                            influential roles in Asia. The United States does appreciate the
                            advantages of consulting on foreign policy matters with the British.
                            Therefore, the President agreed that the establishment of some form of
                            consultative machinery between Japan and the United States would be
                            mutually beneficial, particularly on such problem areas as China,
                            Southeast Asia, Laos, Viet-Nam and any others which affect our mutual
                            security in Asia and the Pacific.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister expressed his appreciation for past American aid to
                            Japan as well as his hopes for cooperation in jointly devising a policy
                            for Asia which would be responsive to the need for maintaining
                            peace.</p>
                        <p>The President noted that our two governments had already agreed to
                            establish a Joint Cabinet-level Economic Committee<note n="1" xml:id="d335fn1">At a meeting between <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and Foreign Minister Kosaka also held aboard
                                the <hi rend="italic">Honey Fitz</hi>, at 3 p.m., Kosaka expressed
                                appreciation for the U.S. proposal to set up this Committee and
                                stated that the Japanese Government proposed to have six Cabinet
                                members represent it on the Committee. He extended an invitation to
                                have it meet in Tokyo some time during 1961. (Memorandum of
                                conversation by <persName corresp="#p_SRL1">Sneider</persName>;

                            and a Committee <pb n="693" xml:id="pg_693" facs="0729"/>for Scientific,
                            Cultural and Educational Exchanges. Therefore, the President felt that
                            it would be possible to establish consultative machinery, perhaps at the
                            level of our Ambassadors, in the absence of other suggestions. Further,
                            this consultative organization need not limit itself to Asian and
                            Pacific problems, but could also consider global matters, such as
                            Berlin.</p>
                        <p>Following discussions of other matters, the President said he had the
                            impression that our two countries did agree to the desirability of
                            developing consultative machinery to consider global matters of common
                            interest, not merely those of the Asian-Pacific area.</p>
                        <p>To this the Prime Minister expressed great satisfaction, since, he
                            indicated, he himself had been ready to request this type of bilateral
                                consultation.<note n="2" xml:id="d335fn2">At a meeting with

                                and expressed the intention of the United States “to consult

                                where there are serious threats to the international peace and where
                                the interests of both countries are involved, in the same manner as

                        <p>The President introduced the subject of the <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss>, pointing out that the United States consulted fully
                            with Japan before becoming a member. In spite of Japan's great desire to
                            enter the <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> the President did not
                                <pb n="694" xml:id="pg_694" facs="0730"/>think this to be the best
                            time to press for admission.<note n="1" xml:id="d336fn1">According to a
                                memorandum of a telephone conversation between Heller and <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> on June 14, <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> had assured the British that
                                the United States would not regard admission of Japan into the
                                Development Assistance Group as a first step toward getting Japan
                                into the <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> commented: “We are in a bad
                                situation. The President is strong to get the Japanese in.” Heller
                                stated that the <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> was based “on
                                an assumption that we recognize” a “community of dedicated people in
                                this business” who “in an organization like the <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss>” find “themselves plotting
                                against their own government to force a change. Whether you could
                                get Japan in that frame of mind he does not know—the Oriental mind.”

                                    <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> Papers,
                                Japan)</note> The President described the European nature of the
                            institution and its attempt to involve the United States and Canada in
                            its affairs, but pointed out that Japanese membership in the <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> would naturally lead to a demand by
                            the British for admission of Commonwealth nations such as India,
                            Pakistan and Australia, thus destroying its basic character. The
                            President expressed a preference for leaving the matter in abeyance for
                            awhile.</p>
                        <p>The President commented on the role of the <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> in promoting the flow of capital among its members and
                            wondered if it might not be desirable to establish a similar
                            organization to do the same in non-European areas. The President
                            indicated that the United States would consider such a proposal
                            carefully.</p>
                        <p>The President noted that an inquiry by Japan on the question of Japanese
                            admission to the <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> had been received
                            prior to the Prime Minister's visit but pointed out again that the
                            Atlantic nature of the organization would be basically altered by the
                            admission of Japan, which would open the door for applications by other
                            Commonwealth nations.</p>
                        <p>He explained that most European peoples view the <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> as a means to promote greater unity in the Atlantic
                            Community. Therefore, he concluded that it might be better to leave the
                            matter in abeyance and instead, during the summer and fall, consider the
                            establishment of a similar organization for the other Free World
                            nations.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister noted that Japan is asked to join organizations which
                            finance projects in underdeveloped nations, for example the <gloss target="#t_DAG1">DAG</gloss>, but is excluded from trading blocs. He
                            considers this to be most unfair. Should Britain enter the Common Market
                            he feels that Japan's trade position will deteriorate since such
                            membership will no doubt lead to greater restrictions against her.</p>
                        <p>The President noted that British membership would pose a problem for the
                            United States as well as Japan, as would the development of a Latin
                            American trading bloc, both of which would decrease America's export
                            market. Perhaps trade could be increased with the former French colonies
                            of Africa in place of the Latin American market.</p>
                        <pb n="695" xml:id="pg_695" facs="0731"/>
                        <p>However, the President felt that the integration of West Germany into the
                            economic life of Europe is sufficient reason to support the development
                            of the Common Market, because the orientation of post-Adenauer Germany
                            is as yet unknown. He admitted that the United States would have to make
                            a sacrifice to achieve this purpose and recognized that Japan's
                            sacrifice might be greater. In any event, these matters could be
                            discussed with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister expressed particular pleasure with the establishment
                            of the Joint Economic Committee. He also expressed his own and his
                            nation's appreciation for the generous manner in which the United States
                            had negotiated a settlement of the troublesome <gloss target="#t_GARIOA1">GARIOA</gloss> problem. Referring to the
                            importance of Japanese-American trade the Prime Minister emphasized his
                            view that the United States offers the greatest possibility for
                            expansion of Japan's export market.</p>
                        <p>The President assured the Prime Minister that the United States values
                            all trade, including that with Japan. He reaffirmed the free-trade
                            position of his administration and his intention to encourage trade
                            liberalization. The President noted that American reciprocal trade
                            legislation will be up for renewal by Congress next year, and observed
                            that American cotton exporters do not articulately support such
                            legislation despite the fact that they export more cotton to Japan than
                            this country's total cotton textile imports. Since those American
                            manufacturers who are affected by imports are most articulate and
                            energetic in their public opposition to it, the President forecast
                            difficulty in securing renewal of the legislation next year. He
                            emphatically stated his endorsement of liberal trade and promised to do
                            his utmost to secure passage of the extension.</p>
                        <p>(At this point the President himself drew a graph, charting the constant
                            level of Japanese imports from 1957 to 1961 under voluntary export
                            controls in contrast to the sharply ascending line of imports from Hong
                            Kong, which have this year surpassed those from Japan.)</p>
                        <p>The President considered this to be a most serious situation because of
                            its inherent inequity. He indicated that demands for relief by the
                            depressed American textile industry are a source of concern to him, for
                            these articulate demands are focused on Congress. He promised to do his
                            best to maintain a liberal trade policy in both the national and the
                            world interest.<note n="2" xml:id="d336fn2">At a meeting held with the
                                President and a larger group of officials later that afternoon, the
                                Prime Minister “expressed fears that the importing countries would
                                gang up on the exporting countries in the multilateral [textile]
                                talks. The President commented that the best protection for the
                                exporting countries would be an effort to provide a mechanism for
                                the orderly expansion of their markets. Under these circumstances,
                                individual countries would not be hurt such as Japan had been by its
                                multilateral restrictions.” <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> then described U.S. efforts to bring this
                                about. <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> stated that Japan
                                considered these efforts favorably. (Memorandum of conversation by

                        <p>The Prime Minister explained that Japan has embarked on a ten year
                            program to double the national income. As advances are made Japan will
                            increase her imports from the United States from the present $1.5
                            billion level annually to $3 billion annually at the completion of the
                            program. The Prime Minister doubted that Japan could increase her
                            purchases in the United States without reciprocal sales.</p>
                        <p>The President promised that Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> would maintain a continuing interest in this
                            matter. He regretted again that those who benefit from liberal trade
                            policies remain silent in politics while only those who are adversely
                            affected are articulate. He hoped to find a way to stimulate and
                            articulate reaction by those who benefit from their exports to
                            Japan.</p>

                        <p>The President acknowledged the importance of Japan's relationship with
                            the United States, for which reason we watch closely internal
                            developments there. At present the pull toward neutralism, the
                            attraction of Communist China, the desire for non-involvement in the
                            East-West struggle, and the influence of communism and socialism pose a
                            challenge to the Government of Japan. The President assured the Prime
                            Minister that the United States intended to adopt policies which would
                            not embarrass his regime or expose it to political danger. He is aware
                            that American policy decisions do affect free world governments, for
                            example, a decision to resume nuclear tests would have a most serious
                            effect not only in Japan but also in Britain. Therefore, the effect of
                            every American act on the nations of the Free World must be considered
                            most closely. <pb n="697" xml:id="pg_697" facs="0733"/>The President
                            pointed out that Communist China poses the most difficult problem faced
                            by his Administration in terms of its internal consequences.</p>
                        <p>The President recalled that Peiping had attempted to license certain
                            “friendly” companies in Japan for trade and asked the Prime Minister for
                            his assessment of the attraction exerted toward Japan by Communist
                            China. The Prime Minister, in reply, denied that this attraction is as
                            great as the Japanese press indicates. He reassured the President that
                            the great majority of Japanese people are most friendly toward the
                            United States. Even the press favors strong ties between Japan and the
                            United States. In fact at a recent round-table discussion of foreign
                            policy problems by journalists Japanese recognition of Peiping under
                            present conditions was rejected.</p>
                        <p>None of Japan's big companies has been licensed by Peiping to trade with
                            her; only small and medium size firms with leftist tendencies have been
                            so licensed. The Japanese Government hopes to establish an export-import
                            organization to trade with Communist China under government subsidy in
                            an attempt to prevent that regime from channeling Sino-Japanese trade
                            through selected friendly companies.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister characterized the attraction of Communist China as one
                            of “mood”. He asserted that Japan does not wish to disturb her economic
                            relations with the United States merely for trade with Peiping, for such
                            a move would lead to a Japanese economic collapse. He reviewed the
                            Chinese Communist attempt to license “friendly” firms for trade in the
                            same way some British firms are so licensed. He felt that this type of
                            classification of trading firms as “friendly” and by implication
                            “unfriendly” would divide the business community of Japan much as Korea
                            is divided by the 38th parallel.</p>
                        <p>He explained that Japanese trade with the Peiping regime through private
                            companies is of slight scale and value. Since the big companies, such as
                            those in the steel industry, experienced an arbitrary cancellation of
                            contract by China in 1958 there need be no concern about their position
                            on the resumption of trade.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister reaffirmed the Japanese Government's position on the

                            He expected that concrete discussions would take place between Foreign

                            pointed out that the Foreign Minister would shortly visit London to
                            exchange views with Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>, who is scheduled to visit Japan in September
                            of this year. He hoped that a mutually agreeable policy could be
                            achieved by that time. In any event, he promised to continue to consult
                            fully on this matter.</p>

                        <p>The President explained that the United States views the problem of
                            recognition of Outer Mongolia with gravity. Since the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> insists on Outer Mongolian admission
                            to the United Nations as a quid pro quo for Mauritania's admission, the
                            Republic of China stands to lose at least 6 or 7 African votes in the
                            General Assembly should she veto the admission of that regime.
                            Unfortunately, the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> has already
                            announced her intention to veto Outer Mongolia's application for
                            admission.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister suggested that the Republic of China must somehow be
                            brought to view this matter in proper perspective. He recalled that the
                            legal status of the island of Formosa was not determined at the San
                            Francisco Peace Conference, at which Japan merely renounced her
                            sovereignty. He repeated a suggestion he had made to Ambassador
                            Stevenson, that a conference of those nations which attended the San
                            Francisco Conference be called to determine the legal status of
                            Formosa.</p>
                        <p>The President commented that both Mao and Chiang are bitterly opposed to
                            any “two-Chinas” solution and expressed doubts that both parties could
                            be brought to agree to a solution.</p>

                                the Prime Minister. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>
                                stated that although the United States wanted “to leave no doubt as
                                to the clarity” of its “administrative control” over the Ryukyus, it
                                was prepared to do everything possible to improve its administration
                                of them and economic and educational standards in them. (Memorandum
                                of conversation by Sneider; ibid., Secretary's Memoranda of
                                Conversation: Lot 65 D 330)</note> He said it was agreed that the
                            High Commissioner would announce this action since this would support
                            the High Commissioner's position in the area. The Foreign Minister asked
                            whether permission could be granted to fly the Japanese flag on other
                            national holidays as well as the New Year's holiday. He thought this
                            would not be contrary to U.S. administration over the area and would
                            have a good psychological effect on the Ryukyuans, demonstrating that
                            their interests were considered in the meetings with the President. The
                            President said that he would speak to the Secretary of Defense on this
                            matter and reply on the following day to the Prime Minister's
                                suggestion.<note n="2" xml:id="d338fn2">On the morning of June 22

                                the United States was agreeable to his suggestion that the Japanese

                                would solely serve to confirm Japan's residual sovereignty over the
                                Ryukyus and meant no change in U.S. responsibilities in them. Kosaka
                                “expressed complete agreement.” <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> then stated that <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> had agreed to flying the Japanese flag on

                                that it would help stabilize the situation in the Ryukyus.
                                (Memorandum of conversation by <persName corresp="#p_SRL1">Sneider</persName>; ibid.)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister explained the Japanese Government's position on the
                            Ryukyus. He said that he had no intention of seeking restoration to
                            Japan of civil administration over the Islands or interfering in any way
                            with U.S. administration. He felt, however, that within the framework of
                            continued U.S. administration it was important to minister to the
                            economic needs of the people and give them treatment at least equivalent
                            to that accorded Japanese nationals in the poorer prefectures of Japan.
                            He pointed out that the tax burden of the Okinawa citizens was far
                            higher than that borne by the people of the poorer Japanese prefectures.
                            He mentioned that in Tottori prefecture grants by the central government
                                <pb n="700" xml:id="pg_700" facs="0736"/>provide 90 per cent of the
                            prefectural revenues, with only ten per cent derived from local taxes.
                            In contrast, 80 to 90 per cent of the Ryukyuan expenditures are paid for
                            by local taxes, with the remainder coming from U.S. assistance. This
                            situation creates pressures in the Ryukyus for return of Japanese
                            administration. The Prime Minister concluded that the best way to
                            diminish reversionist desires is to provide the Ryukyuans with treatment
                            comparable to that which they would receive if residing in a Japanese
                            prefecture.</p>
                        <p>The President said that the only interest of the U.S. in the Ryukyus is
                            to support our security position in Southeast Asia and Korea. Okinawa,
                            for example, was the main staging base for possible operations in Laos.
                            It is a key military base in the Far East and the U.S. and Japan have a
                            common interest in maintaining this base as a powerful center for
                            possible military operations, both in Southeast Asia and Korea. If the
                            U.S. were forced to give up Okinawa as a military base, quite possibly
                            we might have to deploy all the way back to Hawaii. The President said
                            that we agree fully with the need to better living conditions in the
                            area and recognize the sensitivity of this issue for Japan. The Japanese
                            suggestions for improving conditions there and Japanese assistance in
                            the area were much appreciated. The President said we ought to make the
                            maximum effort to raise the standards in the Ryukyus. He reiterated that
                            our interest in the area is not colonial, but flows purely from security
                            considerations. He suggested that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_REO1">Reischauer</persName> discuss further with the Japanese Government
                            steps to improve the livelihood of the Ryukyuans and report these views
                            back.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> raised the
                            possibility of setting up a round table group consisting of the U.S.,
                            Japan, and the <gloss target="#t_GRI1">GRI</gloss> to provide the
                            Ryukyuans with an avenue of expression. The President said he would
                            review this with the Department of Defense and the High Commissioner,
                            and following this review have Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_REO1">Reischauer</persName> discuss the problem further with the Japanese
                            Government. The President concluded that he felt the U.S. and Japan
                            shared a common interest in the Ryukyus, both in improving the
                            livelihood of the Ryukyuan people and in avoiding pressures for
                            reversion. He was certain the Communist powers wished to push the U.S.
                            out of Okinawa, and if this occurred it would be very difficult to
                            maintain the Free World position in Asia.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said he fully appreciated and understood the very
                            important security requirements of the U.S. in Okinawa. He recognized
                            that [there] was considerable opposition in Japan to bringing nuclear
                            weapons into his country, so that he fully understood the need to
                            maintain the U.S. position on Okinawa as a base for such weapons.</p>

                        <p>The Foreign Minister expressed his gratification for the constructive,
                            frank, and productive exchanges of views with the Secretary. He said the
                            talks in Washington had been very favorably received in Tokyo and that
                            they further consolidated the understanding and friendship between Japan
                            and the United States. He pointed out that both he and the Prime
                            Minister had sought to reflect in their conversations the views of
                            various segments of opinion in Japan. He hoped the Secretary would
                            understand that Japanese public opinion was not united and there were
                            some elements in Japan who sought to distort the truth. However, the
                            Government was making every effort to enlighten the public and unify
                            Japanese opinion.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary responded that he considered the discussions with the Prime
                            Minister and the Foreign Minister extraordinarily important <pb n="702" xml:id="pg_702" facs="0738"/>and helpful and that a fresh, new step
                            forward has been made in United States-Japanese relations. He expressed
                            great personal satisfaction with the talks in view of his personal
                            involvement with Japanese matters since 1941 and the great change in
                            relations between the countries over the last 20 years. He remarked that
                            while on occasion we may be disturbed by the attitudes of some segments
                            of Japanese opinion, we recognize that United States people also do not
                            speak as a single voice. He concluded that the visit had served to
                            consolidate relations between the two countries at the official level
                            and to encourage better relations between private citizens in both
                            countries. He hoped that from the visit would flow increased
                            consultation between the two governments and he urged the Japanese
                            Government to take the initiative in expressing its views on important
                            international matters even if the United States Government is not in a
                            position to express its position definitively.<note n="2" xml:id="d339fn2">At 11 a.m. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> held a final brief conversation with Prime

                            the extent to which economic and social conditions contribute to the
                            dissatisfaction of the Ryukyuans, what measures can we undertake to
                            improve economic and social conditions, and what specific steps are
                            needed to make such a program effective. In carrying out its task the
                            group will bear in mind the importance to us of (a) Okinawa as a

                        <p>1. While the United States is in no way ashamed of its offer on cotton
                            textiles which represents an 8-10% increase in Japan's export
                            opportunities <pb n="704" xml:id="pg_704" facs="0740"/>at a time when
                            other import suppliers are to be cut back (e.g. a 30% rollback for Hong
                            Kong)—the increase being accepted at a time when the domestic industry
                            is encountering unemployment—the agreement is proposed without a
                            contention that in itself it is attractive or perhaps wholly palatable
                            to the Japanese Government and the Japanese industry.</p>
                        <p>2. Rather, it is proposed for acceptance by Japan as one of the essential
                            preconditions to the maintenance of an economic policy in the United
                            States which is a prerequisite of well-founded relationships between the
                            two countries. In the absence of a bilateral agreement with Japan, the
                            possibilities of achieving some sort of rollback with Hong Kong, thus to
                            restore some equity in the positions, becomes remote. Without U.S.
                            bilateral understandings with these two important suppliers, the
                            prospects of the Geneva multilateral agreement fade.<note n="2" xml:id="d341fn2">For text of the Geneva Cotton Textile Agreement
                                dated July 21, 1961, see Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, August 21, 1961, p. 336.</note> If the Geneva
                            agreement fails to come to fruition, domestic pressures are certain to
                            seek in the United States unilaterally imposed specific quantitative
                            restrictions, commodity by commodity, country by country.</p>
                        <p>3. Such a result would mean the torpedoing of a commercial policy which
                            has been pursued since the time of Cordell Hull and which was reaffirmed
                            in our wartime agreements with the United Kingdom, which in turn started
                            the undertaking to create an international trade organization which in
                            its final form is the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>. The
                            institution of quantitative restrictions on cotton textiles would
                            generate insuperable pressures from a wide range of other domestic
                            interests which find imports from Japan disturbing or disruptive. The
                            range of Japanese exports now subject to voluntary controls needs only
                            to be recalled. The pressures will range from wire nails, pipe fittings,
                            plywood, chinaware, woolen suits, steel flatware, optical goods,
                            electronic items, basic and finished steel, ad infinitum. The whole
                            spectrum of Japanese exports of manufactured goods which provide
                            employment for such an important sector of the Japanese people and
                            provide its treasury with foreign exchange for essential needs from
                            abroad will be threatened. This in turn cannot fail to undermine the
                            degree of political and military understanding between the two countries
                            which happily now prevails.</p>
                        <p>4. In the light of these predictable consequences, it therefore behooves
                            Japan and the United States to work in partnership to protect the

                        <p>On August 22, 1961, a Japanese Delegation led by Minoru Seki, Director of
                            the Economic Affairs Bureau in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and a
                            U.S. Delegation led by <persName corresp="#p_CW1">Warren

                            July 21, 1961.</p>
                        <p>Documentation in Department of State, Central Files 611.9441 and 411.946
                            for June through September 1961 indicates that Japan wanted an increase
                            in its cotton textile quota for 1962 of approximately 30 percent and
                            that the Bureau of Far Eastern Affairs believed this to be a reasonable
                            figure in view of the facts that Japan had received an increase of only
                            5 percent since the quota program was initiated in 1957 and that its
                            share of cotton fabric imports had fallen from 70 percent to 18 percent
                            of all U.S. imports of these items during the same period. <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss> nonetheless believed that U.S. domestic
                            political considerations made it unfeasible for the United States to
                            meet Japanese wishes and on June 7 Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> offered Japan 5 percent plus some
                            flexibility among various categories of items. By the time the two
                            delegations met in Tokyo, the United States had increased its offer.

                            this year will reach massive proportions. There little doubt that these
                            small and large humiliations have now accumulated to point where many
                            Japanese, in out of government, have come hold real bitterness toward
                            US.</p>
                        <p>I do not wish exaggerate matters (our position here is not so fragile
                            that it will be shaken seriously by aftermath textile agreement). At
                            same time I fear that if we continue along path charted over past few
                            years, our relationship may eventually be damaged irreparably. Trade is
                            so close to problem Japanese survival that we cannot hope enjoy full
                            Japanese friendship and partnership if we continue treat Japan as not
                            fully suitable for polite trading society. In my opinion we urgently
                            need trade policy that will give <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>

                        <p>1. Domestic Political Context and Impact of Hakone Meeting: The Secretary
                            described in general terms his meeting with former Prime Minister
                            Yoshida on November 1,<note n="1" xml:id="d346fn1">No memorandum of this
                                conversation has been found.</note> and said he had felt some
                            puzzlement at Yoshida's offer to convey his views to Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName>, in view of the close
                            personal relationship and the direct contact existing between the
                            Secretary and the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister explained that
                            Yoshida's remark had been in the nature of a formal courtesy. He said he
                            enjoyed Yoshida's full confidence and support; after the Secretary's
                            meeting with Yoshida, <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> had
                            had a three-hour tete-a-tete with him on the subject of the Hakone
                            Conference and his talk with the Secretary.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister emphasized the unity and stability of his “strong-man
                            cabinet.” He attributed his success in organizing this cabinet in good
                            part to his trip to Washington. Following this trip he had had no
                            trouble in getting the factional leaders to join the cabinet. This
                            contrasted with the difficulties experienced by previous Prime Ministers
                            in lining up the more powerful political figures for their cabinets. It
                            had taken former Prime Minister Kishi two hours to persuade Ikeda to
                            join the Kishi cabinet, for example.</p>
                        <p>When <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> formed his cabinet last
                            July, the factional leaders had practically fallen over themselves in
                            their eagerness to join.</p>
                        <p>One incident related by the Prime Minister (in response to the
                            Secretary's request for comment on Finance Minister Mizuta's background)
                            illustrated both the eagerness of the present cabinet ministers to join
                            the cabinet and the personal relationship between <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> and Mizuta. <pb n="711" xml:id="pg_711" facs="0747"/>Mizuta, although technically a member
                            of the Ohno faction, had been willing to defy the dictates of his
                            faction (which had been holding out for more representation in the
                            cabinet) or even to leave it if necessary to join the cabinet.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister noted that in the greetings which he had exchanged
                            with the Secretary at the beginning of the lunch, he had expressed the
                            intention of sending the present cabinet members to the United States
                            for the next meeting of the Joint Committee. This Joint Committee
                            meeting would occur after the party elections of next July, so that the
                            Prime Minister's remarks were in effect serving notice on the strongmen
                            present at the lunch that <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName>
                            intended to stay in power with his strongman Cabinet following the party
                            elections. The Prime Minister said that if he did stay in after next
                            July, then his cabinet would run for three years. He hoped within those
                            three years to be able to reform the political character of the Japanese
                            population, reducing the ratio of “un-Japanese” from the present roughly
                            one-third to one-fourth or one-fifth. <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> said that the Hakone meeting might have advanced
                            the target date for the completion of this transformation by a year or
                            so.</p>
                        <p>2. Nuclear Weapons: The Prime Minister said the very fact that there is a
                            debate in Japan on the problem of nuclear weapons for Japan reflected
                            the fact that at least a minority considered it necessary for Japan also
                            to have nuclear weapons. This minority, he indicated, included people in
                            his own cabinet and party. The Secretary made it clear that the United
                            States was opposed to the proliferation of nuclear powers, with the
                            tremendous waste of resources and the other difficulties and dangers
                            this would entail. He said that the United States remained as firmly
                            committed as it had been in 1946 to the principle of effective
                            international control over nuclear armaments. He mentioned the almost
                            inconceivable destruction that would be caused by a nuclear war, not
                            only on the belligerents but on all other countries of the world. It was
                            enough to make one consider seriously the possibility of emigration to
                            the moon, he remarked. He did not think that any rational world leader
                            could take the responsibility of initiating a nuclear war. The Prime
                            Minister replied that he had not been thinking so much of Japan's going
                            into the production of nuclear weapons, but of the argument that the
                            presence of nuclear weapons in Japan might be necessary for its defense.
                            He indicated that he would be interested in learning more about the
                            broader aspects of the nuclear armaments question.</p>
                        <p>3. Japan's Role in Foreign Affairs: The Secretary complimented the Prime
                            Minister on Japan's increasing willingness to take the initiative in
                            foreign affairs, both in the United Nations and in other fields. The
                            Prime Minister said this was perhaps attributable in part to the growth
                            of Japan's real power. He also said that Japan's representative in the
                            United Nations, Mr. Okazaki, was extremely well qualified and that
                            Ambassador <pb n="712" xml:id="pg_712" facs="0748"/>
                            <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Asakai</persName> in Washington was one of
                            Japan's best Ambassadors. The Secretary commented that Mr. Okazaki had
                            given a good demonstration of his qualifications as a negotiator during
                            the negotiations for the Administrative Agreement in 1951.<note n="2" xml:id="d346fn2">

                                negotiated the original Administrative Agreement (operative until
                                1960) in January and February 1952. It was signed at Tokyo on
                                February 28, 1952, and entered into force that same day; for text,

                        </p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister remarked ruefully that he seemed to be achieving
                            considerable success in the foreign policy field, where he was a rank
                            amateur, but encountering difficulties in the economic field, where he
                            considered himself an expert.</p>

                            believe that the President must do what has to be done.” Your excellent
                            statement was received here about as well as could be expected in Japan.
                            Official government statement was masterpiece of combining Japanese
                            viewpoint in low key with tactful indication Japanese understanding our
                            problem. <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> told me privately
                            that he expects to remain in office for another three years. This of
                            some significance since at least two members his present cabinet are
                            standing in the wings ready to succeed. Incidentally, Yoshida told me
                            that <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> had been a new man
                            since his visit to Washington and was moving in foreign affairs with a
                            confidence and ability which had greatly enhanced his strength and
                            position in Japan.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> is taking the Korean matter
                            with great seriousness and will do everything possible to put relations

                            Washington.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> was optimistic about
                            prospects of bringing Burma further into free world and away from
                            Communist China. Through close personal friends in Burmese Government,
                                <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> is trying to work out
                            Japanese aid to Burma which would divert latter from large ChiCom
                            assistance.</p>
                        <p>In keeping his general interest in fresh Japanese initiatives throughout
                            Asian free countries, <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> will
                            try to smooth over Cambodian-Thai problem prior to and during his
                            forthcoming visit India and Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p>Although he may not know critical nature present situation in Vietnam,
                            Ikeda showed great misgivings about introducing US combat forces in that
                            country. He seems to think that economic assistance was what was
                            required. My guess is that he needs more factual information about
                            Vietnam and will arrange to provide this through Embassy.</p>
                        <p>I was impressed with general atmosphere here of need and opportunity for
                            Japan to play a much more active role in Asia, a mood prompted both by
                            political and economic considerations. It is obvious that Reischauer has
                            gotten off to an excellent start and that he and his wife are highly
                            regarded both in official circles and publicly.</p>

                        <p>Suggest following points be used in response protest by <persName corresp="#p_TR1">Takeuchi</persName>:</p>
                        <p>(1) This Government considers Japanese participation in international
                            textile discussions most useful and looks forward to its continued
                            cooperation in attempts work out solution to problems international
                            trade in cotton textiles which will accord with basic interests both
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>(2) President's November 21 request for Tariff Commission investigation
                            was in accordance Section 22 Agricultural Adjustment Act which provides
                            for full investigation and opportunity all interested parties present
                            their views. We note from <persName corresp="#p_TR1">Takeuchi</persName>
                            statements that Japanese business interests will actively oppose fee at
                            hearings and we would anticipate such opposition. Assume arguments
                            regarding Japanese purchases raw cotton and others outlined reftel would
                            be used as appropriate by Japanese interests in their appearance before
                            Tariff Commission. Tariff Commission recommendation, after full study
                            all facts, will be based on its conclusion as to whether case has in
                            fact been made under provision Section 22.</p>
                        <p>(3) President's May 2 program of assistance to US textile industry
                            directed Department of Agriculture to explore and make recommendations
                            to eliminate or offset cost to US mills of adverse differential in raw
                            cotton costs between domestic and foreign textile producers. Since that
                            date, Department of Agriculture has been working in consultation with
                            interested groups in effort develop recommendations for changes in
                            cotton production adjustment and price support system that would better
                                <pb n="715" xml:id="pg_715" facs="0751"/>meet various objectives
                            deemed desirable. These consultations are continuing. If program
                            developed to eliminate present two price system for cotton, need for
                            equalization fee would of course also be eliminated.</p>
                        <p>(4) Regarding confidential letter exchanged connection 1962 US-Japan
                                bilateral,<note n="3" xml:id="d348fn3">See <ref target="#d343fn4">footnote 4, Document 343</ref>.</note> we agree that this
                            letter does not mean GOJ has abandoned right to object to imposition
                            equalization fee. However, we are concerned at statement<note n="4" xml:id="d348fn4">By <persName corresp="#p_TR1">Takeuchi</persName>,
                                as reported in telegram 1625.</note> that if fee imposed, bilateral
                            textile agreement would be dead. Letter provides that application of
                            non-discriminatory fee to compensate for US two price cotton system
                            should not cause arrangement to become inoperative. We believe Takeuchi
                            statement inconsistent this provision.</p>
                        <p>(5) Re query concerning US plans for consultation with <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> in case imposition equalization fee
                            approved, suggest Takeuchi be informed that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> would be prepared consult with <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> and give prompt and sympathetic consideration to
                            appropriate remedies any adverse effect resulting from equalization fee,
                            if such fee were to be imposed. However, Tariff Commission
                            recommendation impossible forecast, and we believe it premature to enter
                            into consultation at this time.</p>

                        <p>Prime Minister's Residence, Shinanomachi</p>
                        <p>After an exchange of greetings, the Attorney General said that President
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> had asked him to tell
                            the Prime Minister that he feels their meetings in Washington last year
                            were most beneficial; that a great deal has been accomplished by the
                            economic, scientific, and cultural conferences, and that a great deal
                            more can be accomplished in the future. The President had also asked the
                            Attorney General to reassure the Prime Minister that the arrangements
                            and agreements which the United States is attempting to make with the
                            members of the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> will benefit not only
                            the United States and the Western European countries, but also Japan.
                            The President has emphasized again and again to the representatives of
                            the countries concerned that it is not enough, for the sake of the
                            strength of the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> and the United
                            States, and they become fortresses in isolation; they must share with
                            others the benefits that they produce for themselves.</p>
                        <p>The Attorney General said he had also discussed with the President the
                            cotton equalization fee. The Administration is in the midst of a major
                            domestic struggle with some very important economic groups over its
                            efforts to lower trade barriers. However, the President wanted to assure
                            the Prime Minister that the trend in the United States is toward lower
                            tariffs, and that as far as the equalization fee is concerned, all that
                            has been done so far is to request the Tariff Commission to make a study
                            of the program. The Attorney General explained that this problem
                            presented some internal difficulty for the United States. There is
                            unemployment in the textile industry, and a number of companies have
                            gone out of business, <pb n="717" xml:id="pg_717" facs="0753"/>with some
                            economic upheaval and attendant problems for ordinary citizens. The
                            President and the Attorney General, being natives of Massachusetts,
                            which lost its textile mills to the South, are particularly aware of
                            these problems. However, the President feels that the way to progress
                            lies not in raising tariffs, but in lowering them. The Attorney General
                            said the President was of course free to accept or reject the
                            recommendation of the Tariff Commission after it had made its
                                study.<note n="2" xml:id="d349fn2">On September 6 President

                                the Tariff Commission had rejected the Agriculture Department's
                                recommendation for an import fee of 8.5 cents a pound on the cotton
                                content of textile imports. He stated also his intention to
                                recommend to the next Congress “legislation designed to remove the
                                inequity created by the present two-price cotton system.” For text

                        <p>The Prime Minister expressed his appreciation for the President's
                            message. He went on to explain the sensitivity of current problems in
                            United States-Japanese economic relations and the adverse reaction of
                            Japanese businessmen to any signs of protectionism on the part of the
                            United States, such as the “Buy American” policy and the <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> purchases of fertilizer, which were
                            undermining the natural development of Japanese markets in Southeast
                            Asia. He criticized the “stereotyped” character of United States
                            aid.</p>
                        <p>The Attorney General said that in view also of the problems on the
                            American side, including the loss of gold, there are bound to be
                            disagreements between Japan and the United States; but he said it was
                            the judgment of the United States Government that there is so much good
                            will between the two Governments and peoples that as a general matter
                            difficulties can be resolved. Perhaps the particular difficulty
                            mentioned by the Prime Minister was not going to be resolved, but in
                            general the President was trying to move in the direction of closer
                            relations with Japan.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister recalled that when he was in the United States in 1960
                            he had told Mr. Rockefeller that he thought it was premature to start
                            working on a broader economic framework for Asia. Conditions have
                            changed in the past year, however, and he thought the idea of an Asian
                            Economic Community deserved more careful attention. He asked what the
                            United States felt about the possibility of closer United
                            States-Japanese cooperation in the development of Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p>The Attorney General said the President is very much interested in this
                            area; he thought that if Japan and the United States as partners can
                            work jointly to develop this kind of cooperation, it would be very
                            helpful in years to come.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister suggested that the United States ought to put more
                            emphasis on Burma in its aid program (and perhaps less on India) and
                            said that this was an area in which Japanese cooperation in economic
                            assistance could be most helpful. He knew from close personal
                            acquaintance <pb n="718" xml:id="pg_718" facs="0754"/>with Burmese Chief
                            of Staff Aung Gyin and other Burmese that the military there are
                            anti-Communist. However, loans from Communist China totaling #160
                            million exert a powerful attraction. The Prime Minister mentioned the
                            Burmese four-year economic development plan, and referred to the mission
                            which Japan was about to send to Burma to assist in the development of
                            this plan.</p>
                        <p>The Attorney General said he would mention the Prime Minister's point to
                            the President and to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HF1">Hamilton</persName>
                            of the <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> program. He commented on the
                            similarity of the developmental problems of Southeast Asia to those of
                            South America, and hoped that Japan could take a more active part in
                            sending expertise and technological assistance to these areas. He felt
                            that the United States-Japanese partnership could play a most important
                            part in planning and assisting the development of the less-developed
                            countries. The Prime Minister agreed, but thought a concentrated effort
                            should be made along these cooperative lines in Southeast Asia.</p>

                        <p>A. Future US-Japan relationship would be based on economic cooperation
                            agreement by which Japan would contribute perhaps one third of cost of
                            US-approved economic and social development aid programs in Ryukyus. If
                            necessary agreement could specifically mention eventual reversion of
                            Ryukyus to Japan. (See text of illustrative agreement among Task Force
                            working papers pouched Embassy.)<note n="7" xml:id="d350fn7">Not found
                                attached. A copy of the draft, December 15, is attached to a
                                memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> to

                                16. (Department of State, Central Files, 794C.0221/4-662)</note>
                            Cooperation with Japan would be developed to maximum degree consistent
                            with retaining control of base, recognizing that this will mean greater
                            Japanese influence but need not impair US control.<note n="8" xml:id="d350fn8">An undated copy of these recommendations points out
                                that the Japanese Government had “no desire to push us out of
                                Okinawa,” but instead welcomed the U.S. base there, which
                                contributed to Japanese security “without creating the political
                                problems which would follow if the base were situated in Japan.”
                                Nevertheless, the Japanese Government would “continue to speak
                                publicly in favor of returning administration of the Ryukyus to
                                Japan” while recognizing that the United States would not do so in
                                the “foreseeable future.” (Kennedy Library, President's Office

                            and FonMin and technical questions in Naha by US-Japan-<gloss target="#t_GRI1">GRI</gloss> Committee. (See illustrative
                            agreement.)</p>
                        <p>D. Aid programs would concentrate on providing short range benefits in
                            areas where Ryukyuans are clearly worse off now than they would be under
                            Japan and on long range economic development. Cost of recommended
                            programs would rise from $17 million to $27 million over five years,
                            with US share dependent on outcome negotiations with Japan.</p>
                        <p>E. Reorganization of administration to vest in a civilian Civil
                            Administrator, appointed by SecDef in consultation with SecState and
                            with approval of President, all administrative functions retained by US
                            except ultimate authority of veto over acts of <gloss target="#t_GRI1">GRI</gloss>, promulgation of basic ordinances and liaison with
                            State and Embassy Tokyo in conduct foreign relations. Latter functions
                            would remain with High Commissioner, who would continue to be military
                            officer. Under Civil Administrator there would be clear division between
                            supervision and control function on one hand and technical assistance
                            function on other. Report emphasizes importance of attracting competent

                        <p>DEAR <persName>GEORGE</persName>: I trust that the furor over the <hi rend="italic">Wall Street Journal</hi> rewrite of the Beecher
                            article on the Attorney General's so-called “hint” about the
                            equalization fee<note n="1" xml:id="d351fn1">Reference is to an article
                                by Henry Beecher which appeared in <hi rend="italic">The Wall Street
                                    Journal</hi> on February 10. The article stated that Attorney
                                General <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> had hinted
                                while in Japan that the United States would not impose the cotton
                                equalization fee with regard to Japan. After receiving
                                representations from <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>,
                                    <hi rend="italic">The Wall Street Journal</hi> printed a partial
                                retraction on February 13. Further documentation on this incident is
                                ibid., 033.1100-KE/2-1062, and in the Kennedy Library, <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> Papers, Telephone Calls,
                                Japan, February 10-12, 1962.</note> has quieted down long before
                            this letter arrives. But, in case it has not, I feel that you should
                            know one matter that was not brought out in the telegraphic exchanges
                            for fear that it might leak.</p>
                        <p>The Attorney General was supposed to have a personal message from the
                            President for <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> (in fact, he
                            had none), and we were informed (I cannot remember who in his party
                            transmitted the information) that, before the Attorney General left
                            Washington, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Asakai</persName> had
                            been given a broad hint or even more that the President as of now did
                            not intend to apply the equalization fee, whatever the Commission's
                            recommendation might be. Since there was every reason to believe
                                <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Asakai</persName> had sent this
                            information to <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName>, the Attorney
                            General and I decided that it would look most curious to <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> if the Attorney General did not
                            mention this point as part of the President's personal message. Under
                            the circumstances, in fact, silence on this point might have seemed like
                            a rupture of the close relationship <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> feels he established with the President in June.
                            Consequently, the Attorney General, after giving <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> the President's assurances of his
                            determination to move toward more liberal international trade and to
                            exert his energies to see that Japan was not economically isolated, told
                            the Prime Minister that the President as of now did not expect to apply
                            the equalization fee, but hoped to rectify the inequalities of the
                            two-price system in some other way.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName>'s reaction showed that it
                            would indeed have been most unfortunate if the Attorney General had not
                            made this statement. Ikeda said that he himself already knew of this
                            from <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Asakai</persName>, that he had felt all
                            along the President would not apply the equalization fee, but that he
                            felt it would be most undesirable if this information leaked out at this
                            time and that he, therefore, hoped the Attorney General would not tell
                            anyone, including the Foreign Minister, of the President's thinking on
                            this matter. Only six persons were in the room at the time—<persName corresp="#p_OM1">Ohira</persName>, the Cabinet <pb n="722" xml:id="pg_722" facs="0758"/>Secretary, Miyazawa of the Upper House
                            (both close aides of the Prime Minister), Osborn of the Embassy and
                            myself. My wording in Embassy telegram #2234<note n="2" xml:id="d351fn2">Dated February 10. (Department of State, Central Files,
                                033.1100-KE/2-1062) It was sent for the Department's use in denying
                                the statement in the original Wall Street Journal article concerning
                                the interest equalization tax.</note> (“At no time did he make any
                            statement or observation that could reasonably have provided basis even
                            for Beecher's original implications, much less Journal's further
                            distortions.”) was meant to exclude this conversation with the Prime
                            Minister, since it obviously could not “have provided basis” for story.
                            The statements in this telegram, therefore, are absolutely correct in my
                            judgment.</p>
                        <p>There is one other point about the equalization fee problem I might as
                            well bring up now. When a final decision is made by the President,
                            whatever it may be, it would be highly desirable to have it passed to
                            Ikeda before it is made public in Washington. This would strengthen his
                            feeling of closeness to the President and would give him a chance to
                            assume a suitable posture for the moment when the news breaks. A day or
                            two in advance would probably be adequate, and the most intimate and
                            therefore desirable way of passing the news to him would, I feel, be
                            through me.</p>
                        <p>I sometimes despair of our American newsmen over here. They know so
                            little of Japan that they get things wrong constantly. In the light of
                            what has already been said between us and the Japanese and what is in
                            their minds, the Attorney General (except for his <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> talk) was constantly throwing
                            water on their hopes that the equalization fee would not be imposed.
                            Despite this fact, I cannot overemphasize what a tremendous success the
                            Attorney General's visit was, especially the incident at Waseda
                                University.<note n="3" xml:id="d351fn3">According to telegram 2183
                                from Tokyo, February 6, the Attorney General dealt effectively with
                                “Communist-sponsored” hecklers during a visit to Waseda University
                                that day, and his handling of the incident favorably impressed the
                                Japanese public. (Ibid., 033.1100-KE/2-662)</note> While the latter
                            skirted the thin edge of disaster, it turned out to be a resounding
                            triumph that may well have a lasting effect on the student movement in
                                Japan.<note n="4" xml:id="d351fn4">The Embassy's lengthy telegraphic

                            responsibility for the following measures:</p>
                        <p>1. Initiation of negotiations with the Government of Japan to provide a
                            framework for a continuing Japanese contribution to economic assistance
                            to the Ryukyus that minimizes interferences with our administrative
                            control and that recognizes, at least tacitly, our intention to continue

                        <p>2. Presentation to the appropriate members of the Congress of the need
                            for these negotiations and the goals we are seeking to achieve. Also,
                            provision of such assistance to the Secretary of Defense as he may
                            request in supporting his requests to the Congress for legislative
                            changes and increased appropriations in accordance with the

                                recognized the Ryukyus “to be a part of the Japanese homeland” and
                                looked “forward to the day when the security interests of the Free
                                World will permit their restoration to full Japanese sovereignty.”
                                He stated that he was asking the Congress to raise the $6 million
                                ceiling on U.S. assistance to the Ryukyus and to “provide over
                                future years a steady increase in loan funds” for Ryukyuan

                        <p>The Agreement provides for payment to the United States by Japan of the
                            principal sum of $490 million over a period of 15 years in semiannual
                            installments, with interest at 2-1/2 percent per annum on the unpaid
                            balance. Accompanying exchanges of notes provide that 1) the United
                            States intends, subject to appropriate legislation, to use the major
                            portion of the payments to further its economic assistance programs and
                            2) the United States will accept $25 million of the total repayment in
                            yen to be used for educational and cultural exchange between the two
                            countries. A letter handed to the Japanese Foreign Minister on January 9
                            states the U.S. intention to accept this $25 million in yen from the
                            first two installments.</p>
                        <p>The bulk of the assistance to Japan covered by this Agreement was
                            provided under U.S. Appropriations Acts for Government and Relief in

                            years 1947 through 1952, plus assistance provided on an emergency basis
                            by the Army prior to the <gloss target="#t_GARIOA1">GARIOA</gloss>
                            appropriations. Total disbursements for Japan under these <pb n="727" xml:id="pg_727" facs="0763"/>appropriations were about $1.99
                            billion. After deductions for U.S. administrative expenses, counterpart
                            funds not of direct benefit to the Japanese economy, etc. the U.S. claim
                            for <gloss target="#t_GARIOA1">GARIOA</gloss> assistance to Japan was
                            about $1.8 billion.</p>
                        <p>Formal negotiations with Japan on this claim began in May 1954.
                            Settlement has been delayed to await the settlement of Japan's
                            reparations obligations and because of a series of difficult political
                            and economic problems in Japan. Since the opening of the negotiations
                            this claim settlement has been a major political issue in Japan, where
                            many people have considered this assistance to be a gift. Although each
                            succeeding Japanese Prime Minister since 1952 has publicly and privately
                            recognized <gloss target="#t_GARIOA1">GARIOA</gloss> as a “debt of
                            honor,” Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> is
                            the first to take steps to make a settlement.</p>
                        <p>The Socialist Party, the Democratic Party and certain elements of the
                            Liberal Democratic Party have opposed settlement of <gloss target="#t_GARIOA1">GARIOA</gloss> from the beginning. The
                            government in power has been subjected to questioning on this matter at
                            each succeeding session of the Diet since 1954. With the Agreement now
                            pending before the Diet for ratification, the Socialist Party is
                            organizing its opposition to it. All opposing factions are expected to
                            seek to use the coincidence of the settlement with Japan's present
                            deteriorating foreign exchange position to embarrass <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName>. The <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> government appears to have prepared well for
                            debate on this issue and to date appears to be handling it with
                            considerable skill. Although particularly acrimonious debate centering
                            on U.S.-Japanese relations is expected, present estimates are that the
                            Agreement will be ratified in May.<note n="3" xml:id="d353fn3">By May

                        <p>GUIDELINES OF U.S. POLICY AND OPERATIONS TOWARD JAPAN</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">I. Basic Approach</p>
                        <p>1. We see Japan as our principal ally in East Asia, our second largest
                            world trading partner, the host for important forward U.S. military
                            facilities, and a source of technical skill and capital contributing to
                            the economic development of South and Southeast Asia. Japan offers the
                            prospect of development as an increasingly important political, economic
                            and, possibly, military counterweight to the rising power of Communist
                            China.</p>
                        <p>2. Japan's continued control by moderate elements, its readiness to
                            cooperate with the United States in foreign policy, and its ability in
                            the future to play a more constructive role in Asian and world affairs
                            depend on many factors but primarily on the maintenance of a high level
                            of economic activity, which, in turn depends to an unusual extent upon
                            access to world markets. As a reaction to defeat and occupation, there
                            is a profound wish to avoid military involvement and great sensitivity
                            to the risks of nuclear warfare. Recently there has been a growing
                            nationalist sentiment and an increasing desire for independent
                            self-assertion and leadership.</p>
                        <p>3. Accordingly, as Japan attempts with our help to play a more positive
                            role in Asian affairs, U.S. and European economic and trade policies <pb n="729" xml:id="pg_729" facs="0765"/>must be responsive to Japanese
                            marketing needs, and defense links must infringe as little as possible
                            on Japanese prerogatives and sensibilities.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">II. Background</p>
                        <p>1. Japan stands today as a fully independent and influential member of
                            international society. Its recovery since 1945 has been most impressive
                            in the economic sphere and least impressive in the military field. Japan
                            has enjoyed one of the fastest rates of economic growth in the world,
                            averaging nine percent annually during the past ten years; trade has
                            increased to record levels; foreign exchange reserves reached a post-war
                            peak of $2 billion in April, 1961, since reduced to $1.5 billion, and
                            per capita income (about $350) is now the highest in Asia, though still
                            low by the standards of Western industrialized nations.</p>
                        <p>2. The continued rapid rate of economic growth has reinforced the firm
                            grasp over political power in Japan held during the post-war period by
                            the moderate conservative forces (Liberal-Democratic Party), which are
                            supported by over 60 percent of the electorate and have large majorities
                            in both houses of the Diet. The 1960 elections, however, showed a rise
                            of 3.7% since 1958 in the opposition vote. Population shifts partially
                            accounting for this rise seem likely to continue. Major scandals,
                            significant foreign policy failures, or a radical curtailment of the
                            rate of economic growth would accelerate the apparent gradual shift of
                            political power to the left. If as a result of the current economic boom
                            Japan's balance of payments situation should further deteriorate, the
                                <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> Government might be
                            faced with the necessity of taking counter-measures of such severe
                            character that economic growth would be seriously retarded. In such case
                            the position of his Government and the Liberal-Democratic Party would be
                            seriously weakened, particularly in view of promises to double the
                            income of Japanese wage earners within ten years. The conservatives,
                            moreover, have been unable to give Japan the kind of stable, firmly
                            Western-oriented government warranted by their large parliamentary
                            majority, due to certain weaknesses in Japan's post-war structure,
                            principally:</p>
                        <p>a. Factionalism is endemic to the Japanese conservative movement and
                            breeds ineffectual governments if not curbed. Although the leaders of
                            all factions of the Liberal-Democratic Party in varying degrees
                            recognize the necessity of close ties with Western countries, some have
                            shown serious political irresponsibility in their intra-party struggles
                            for power. As a consequence, conservative governments in Japan have been
                            tempted occasionally to sponsor opportunistic policies, to be less
                            cooperative with the United States, and to be susceptible to appeals
                            based on emotionally-tinged nationalism.</p>
                        <p>b. Conservative parties have failed to develop genuine grassroots support
                            for their policies, relying instead on traditional patron-voter <pb n="730" xml:id="pg_730" facs="0766"/>relationships, particularly in
                            rural areas where their main source of strength lies. This failure could
                            become increasingly serious for them with the steady shift of population
                            to the cities and the gradual erosion of traditional political patterns
                            throughout Japan.</p>
                        <p>c. Japan is extremely vulnerable to external economic influences, because
                            the health of its economy is heavily dependent upon a high level of
                            international trade. Conservative public appeal, however, rests
                            increasingly on the “bread and butter” issues and its demonstrated
                            ability to guide an economic growth which has brought steady improvement
                            in living standards. If their economic policies falter, the
                            conservatives could be in very serious difficulties. Therefore, the
                            maintenance of a high level of trade with the West, particularly the
                            United States, is virtually a life or death issue for the
                            conservatives.</p>
                        <p>d. Japan has failed to digest fully the major political and social
                            reforms of the occupation or to develop a solid sense of national
                            purpose. Pre-war totalitarian institutions and national goals are
                            largely discredited. However, the new postwar democratic institutions
                            have shallow roots and are not fully understood by any segment of
                            Japanese society on the right or the left. Furthermore, the Japanese
                            people have not recovered fully from the tremendous social upheaval of
                            the last twenty years or developed a new social equilibrium.</p>
                        <p>e. The urge for neutralism and for disengagement from alignment with the
                            U.S. has a major impact on Japanese policy. Japan is under constant
                            pressure to assume a neutral stance both from Sino-Soviet sources and
                            from left-wing elements in Japan. These appeals often strike a
                            responsive chord: Japan's long isolation from the West ended only a
                            little over 100 years ago; Japanese nationalism is introverted and
                            places great value on “national independence”; and the memories of
                            defeat in World War II and particularly of the atom bombings of
                            Hiroshima and Nagasaki are still intense. While successive conservative
                            governments have rejected a policy of disengagement without election
                            defeat, in deference to these public sentiments they must trim their
                            sails by demonstrations of Japanese independence particularly on such
                            sensitive issues as the Ryukyus and China policy, and by limiting
                            Japanese security ties particularly through the refusal to enter into
                            regional security commitments. Although aware of the United Nations'
                            present limitations, Japan places great store by that body and
                            participates actively in efforts to make it a more effective instrument
                            of peace and progress. The Japanese remain unwilling, however, because
                            of Constitutional considerations, to contribute troops or logistic
                            support to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> emergency operations.</p>
                        <p>f. The Japanese people are haunted by the fear of involvement in another
                            nuclear war, to the point where all manifestations of military activity,
                            whether U.S. or Japanese, are at most acquiesced in by substantial
                            segments of the nation. The conservatives cannot afford to flout these
                                <pb n="731" xml:id="pg_731" facs="0767"/>fears and must tailor their
                            security policies so as to avoid, when possible, heated public debate on
                            military-security issues and particularly must oppose storage of nuclear
                            weapons in Japan. Such storage, however, remains an important U.S.
                            military objective to be pursued when politically feasible.</p>
                        <p>g. The left has demonstrated its capabilities for effective exploitation
                            of Japan's political weaknesses and fears of involvement in a nuclear
                            war, and is often able to handcuff completely government initiatives
                            having large parliamentary support. The left has developed
                            extra-parliamentary means of frustrating the conservative majority
                            through the use of violence to impede or interrupt the normal
                            legislative processes. The Government is deterred from the use of its
                            full powers to override these tactics by the fear of adverse public
                            reaction weakening its mandate, or of the creation of a situation of
                            disorder bordering on the revolutionary. The left, for its part, is
                            restrained by the fear of jeopardizing public support, or at least
                            tolerance, of its activities. Since the left is particularly well
                            entrenched in the communications media and labor circles, it has been
                            able to secure very broad tolerance for its actions, and to impede the
                            efforts of the Government to gain support for its own policies. This
                            situation is particularly dangerous because the Communists have shown
                            themselves capable of effectively influencing left-wing actions to the
                            benefit of the Sino-Soviet bloc.</p>
                        <p>3. Continued conservative rule can, therefore, not be taken for granted.
                            Its vulnerabilities are most evident on issues involving Japan's
                            security ties with the U.S., the status of the Ryukyus, policy toward
                            the Communist bloc, particularly Communist China, and, most importantly,
                            the expansion of Japan's trade and economy. However, the only current
                            alternative is rule by the Japan Socialist Party (<gloss target="#t_JSP1">JSP</gloss>), which seeks not only drastic social
                            revolution in Japan, but a neutralist policy leaning very much in the
                            direction of the Sino-Soviet bloc. There are forces at work within
                            Japanese society which may in time effect a change in the orientation of
                            the <gloss target="#t_JSP1">JSP</gloss>, and a closer approach to the
                            responsibilities of a ruling party might of itself have a sobering
                            effect; however, rule by the Socialists as now oriented would not only
                            completely reverse the present trend of U.S.-Japan relations but could
                            also precipitate a major and decisive power shift in Asia toward the
                            Communist bloc with other Asian nations also swinging to a
                            Communist-oriented neutralism.</p>
                        <p>4. Given this situation, U.S. policy toward Japan must necessarily depend
                            upon maintenance of a moderate, conservative government for the time
                            being. The day may come when this is no longer feasible. Looking toward
                            this day, it is vitally important to seek a gradual moderation of
                            left-wing views, but not at the expense of accelerating or condoning an
                            early accession to power of the left. At the same time, U.S. policy
                            toward Japan must recognize the limitations on the conservatives for
                            actions in <pb n="732" xml:id="pg_732" facs="0768"/>the security field
                            and their most vital dependence on trade as a means of promoting Japan's
                            continued economic growth. This dependence on trade, however, provides
                            the United States with very considerable leverage in Japan. If trade
                            with Japan can be maintained at a growing level over the next decade,
                            Japan's alliance with the U.S. and its inter-dependence with the West
                            can become so intimate and responsive to Japanese interests as to
                            discourage thoroughly any Japanese government, whether left or right,
                            from reversing this course.</p>

                        <p>A. Long-Term Goal</p>
                        <p>The long-term goal of U.S. policy toward Japan is the development of
                            Japan as a major power center in Asia acting in concert with U.S. and
                            Free World interests.</p>
                        <p>B. Short-Term Objectives—(Objectives realistically attainable during the
                            period 1962-64)</p>
                        <p>1. Continuation in power of a moderate, Western-oriented government.</p>
                        <p>2. Maintenance of a U.S.-Japanese alliance based on the political,
                            economic and security provisions of the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and
                            Security.</p>
                        <p>3. Maintenance of our base structure in Japan, primarily to assist in the
                            defense of Japan and to provide logistic support for the U.S. military
                            forces in the Far East.</p>
                        <p>4. A Japanese defense effort capable of maintaining internal security
                            against Communist-inspired subversion and insurgency and capable of
                            assuming increasing responsibility for the defense of the Japan area and
                            thereby, together with U.S. forces, of coping with and deterring
                            Communist aggression in the Pacific.</p>
                        <p>5. Continuation of Japanese acquiescence in the U.S. administration of
                            the Ryukyu and Bonin Islands.</p>
                        <p>6. Growth of a more healthy and moderate outlook on the part of the
                            Japanese intellectual community.</p>
                        <p>7. Development of closer links with the U.S. and other non-Communist
                            nations, particularly developed countries, based on increased trade and
                            greater coordination of economic policies.</p>
                        <p>8. An increasing Japanese contribution to economic growth in
                            non-Communist Asia.</p>
                        <p>9. An expanding international role for Japan, particularly among the
                            Asian and African nations.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">IV. Lines of Action</p>
                        <p>In the short-term, U.S. policy toward Japan will be dominated by
                            achievement of two objectives: continuation in power of a moderate
                            government and the development of an expanding level of trade between
                            Japan and other non-Communist countries. A fundamental reorientation of
                            Japan's position in the world and its relationship to the U.S. will
                            result from failure to achieve either objective.</p>
                        <p>A. U.S.-Japanese Alliance</p>
                        <p>1. Move quickly to resolve differences between Japan and the U.S.</p>
                        <p>2. Maintain a pattern of consultation with Japan consonant with its
                            status as the major partner of the U.S. in Asia, paralleling such
                            consultations with top Western European leaders.</p>
                        <p>3. Seek broader public support in Japan for the U.S.-Japan alliance:</p>
                        <p>a) By expeditious settlement of security and base problems.</p>
                        <p>b) By minimizing overt U.S. pressures on the Japanese Government in
                            security matters.</p>
                        <p>c) By implementing and emphasizing the non-security provisions of Article
                            II of the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security, particularly in the
                            field of trade and economic cooperation.</p>
                        <p>d) By fostering both the concept and reality of equal partnership and
                            interdependence with the U.S. and Free World.</p>
                        <p>e) By promoting ideological identification with the Western democracies
                            and encouraging closer ties with the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries.</p>
                        <p>B. Moderate Government</p>
                        <p>4. Support the continuation in power of a moderate, Western-oriented
                            conservative government in Japan.</p>
                        <p>5. Encourage—without alienating conservative support—the development of
                            moderating trends among the opposition Socialists and their trade union
                            supporters, by such steps as:</p>
                        <p>a) Showing sympathetic interest in Zenro and the Democratic Socialist
                            Party;</p>
                        <p>b) Stimulating broader contacts between non-Communist Sohyo, Zenro and
                            other labor leaders and the U.S. and other Western union leadership, by
                            inter alia continuing a sizeable labor exchange program, while
                            encouraging privately financed programs; and</p>
                        <p>c) Encouraging West European Socialist interest in and contact with the
                            Democratic Socialist Party and the Japan Socialist Party.</p>
                        <p>6. Encourage discreetly Japanese initiatives to strengthen their
                            democratic institutions, and in particular to reduce the government's
                            vulnerability to extra-parliamentary pressures and violence.</p>
                        <p>7. Strengthen systematically cultural and intellectual relations with
                            Japan on a long-term and largely non-governmental basis by:</p>
                        <pb n="734" xml:id="pg_734" facs="0770"/>
                        <p>a) Stimulating and supporting private American and other Western efforts
                            to increase greatly Japanese intellectual, cultural, and youth contacts
                            with democratic societies on the lines recommended at the first meeting
                            of the U.S.-Japan Committee on Cultural and Educational

                        </p>
                        <p>b) Maintaining an expanded U.S. Government educational and cultural
                            exchange program, with emphasis on the areas of political theory, law,
                            social sciences and welfare, communications media, education and
                            labor.</p>
                        <p>c) Stepping up U.S. cultural presentations in Japan, and Japanese
                            cultural presentations in the U.S., by actively encouraging private
                            sponsorship and by providing increased U.S. financial assistance.</p>
                        <p>d) Promoting scientific exchanges, both government and non-government, in
                            non-defense areas, on the lines initiated at the first meeting of the
                            U.S.-Japan Committee on Scientific Cooperation.</p>
                        <p>C. Economic Relations</p>
                        <p>8. Promote closer economic relations and expanded trade between the U.S.
                            and Japan through such actions as:</p>
                        <p>a) Generally maintaining a liberal trade policy and urging Japan and
                            other trading nations to maintain in practice such a policy.</p>
                        <p>b) Consulting through normal diplomatic channels and through the joint
                            U.S.-Japan Committee on Trade and Economic Affairs on problems of trade,
                            aid, investment, regional groupings, technical assistance, economic
                            relations with the Communist bloc, and other economic matters.</p>
                        <p>c) Resisting pressures to establish U.S. import restrictions, or to
                            “negotiate” Japanese “voluntary” export quotas, except where absolutely
                            essential; when Japanese export quotas to the U.S. are unavoidable they
                            should be negotiated on a multilateral basis.</p>
                        <p>d) Handling all specific import commodity problems through the “Escape
                            Clause” or other available legal mechanisms.</p>
                        <p>e) Urging Japan not to raise tariffs solely for protection purposes, or
                            as a means of avoiding the consequences of trade liberalization.</p>
                        <p>f) Urging Japan to take steps toward more meaningful liberalization of
                            items of interest to the United States under its trade and exchange
                            control system with the objective of eliminating all but a “hard core”
                            of non-discriminatory import restrictions.</p>
                        <p>9. Seek Japan's cooperation in the alleviation of the United States
                            balance of payments problem, while avoiding actions in this connection
                            which would have a serious or abrupt adverse effect on Japan's own
                            balance of payments position, trading position, or economic strength
                            generally, through such actions as:</p>
                        <p>a) Pressing vigorously for Japan's trade liberalization (see 8.f
                            above).</p>
                        <pb n="735" xml:id="pg_735" facs="0771"/>
                        <p>b) Promoting increased Japanese assistance to less-developed
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>c) Seeking Japanese understanding of the changed U.S. balance of payments
                            position and of its necessary effect on U.S. economic policy.</p>
                        <p>10. Promote a broadening economic relationship between Japan and Western
                            Europe through such actions as:</p>
                        <p>a) Continuing strongly to urge a liberalization of Western Europe trade
                            policy toward Japan, including the disinvocation of Article XXXV of the
                                <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>b) Promoting at the highest levels of government in Japan and Western
                            Europe understanding of the need for closer economic ties between the
                            two areas.</p>

                            Europe, Canada, the U.S. and other developed nations.</p>
                        <p>d) Continuing to support as appropriate Japan's efforts to secure full
                            membership in <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>D. Japan's International Role</p>
                        <p>11. Encourage and assist Japan to exercise a moderating and constructive
                            influence in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, particularly with
                            the Afro-Asian nations, but avoid efforts to overidentify Japan with
                            Western positions to the extent that its usefulness and influence among
                            Afro-Asians is undermined and to this end accept occasional divergencies
                            of viewpoint.</p>
                        <p>12. Seek to increase Japan's contribution to and assumption of
                            responsibility for the economic development of the less-developed
                            countries through such actions as:</p>
                        <p>a) Encouraging a large-scale economic assistance program to <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>;</p>
                        <p>b) Coordinating, through such mechanisms as DAC and multilateral
                            consortia, U.S. and Japanese economic assistance programs;</p>
                        <p>c) Seeking with Japanese agreement a selective acceleration of
                            utilization by recipient countries of Japan's reparations payments,
                            including urging recipients to make increased use of the loan portions
                            of such payments.</p>
                        <p>d) Encouraging and facilitating, at every opportunity, increased Japanese
                            technical assistance to less-developed countries generally and, in
                            particular, seeking to increase the scope of and Japan's contribution to
                            the Asian Productivity Organization.</p>

                            and particularly Communist China, but recognize that Japanese policy
                            toward Communist China may diverge from U.S. policy in certain <pb n="736" xml:id="pg_736" facs="0772"/>respects. In this connection,
                            encourage Japan to hamper and weaken ties between the Japan Communist
                            Party and the Soviet Union and Communist China.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">E. Security-Military Relations</p>
                        <p>15. In public statements generally avoid reference to the
                            military-security aspects of U.S.-Japanese relations. In such public
                            references to this subject as are appropriate, accentuate the mutually
                            supporting aspects of U.S.-Japanese security relations and seek to
                            reduce fears that U.S. military bases in Japan will increase the risk of
                            Japanese involvement in a nuclear conflict.</p>
                        <p>16. Maintain with Japanese agreement a level of U.S. military facilities
                            and forces in Japan as required to provide primarily logistic support
                            for U.S. forces in the Far East, and to demonstrate our determination to
                            fulfill U.S. treaty commitments to Japan.</p>
                        <p>17. In U.S.-Japanese security relations:</p>
                        <p>a) Assist in the defense of Japan in the event of an armed attack against
                            the territories of Japan.</p>
                        <p>b) Adhere rigidly to the provisions of the consultation arrangements,
                            avoiding actions contrary to the wishes of the Japanese Government as
                            expressed in such consultations.</p>
                        <p>c) Implement the <hi rend="italic">[less than 1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>] response to an attack against the United Nations
                            Forces in Korea only with the authorization of the President.</p>
                        <p>d) Inform the Japanese Government confidentially in advance regarding
                            major United States logistic operations from bases in Japan to areas
                            outside of Japan and regarding any major withdrawal of United States
                            forces from Japan.</p>
                        <p>e) Implement U.S.-Japan administrative arrangements in a manner best
                            calculated to obtain maximum cooperation and support from the Japanese
                            Government and public and to avoid publicly-inflamed base rights issues,
                            being prepared to adjust existing military bases when overall political
                            considerations are believed to outweigh purely military
                            considerations.</p>
                        <p>18. Encourage Japan to increase its defense effort and to modernize its
                            military forces, while avoiding pressures and other actions prejudicial
                            to Japanese political and economic stability. Continue U.S. military
                            assistance for specific projects designed primarily to stimulate the
                            expansion and modernization of Japanese forces. U.S. assistance should
                            be predominantly in the form of U.S. contributions to cost-shared
                            projects, with the Japanese providing approximately 75% of the total
                            cost, and should normally not include items which the Japanese are
                            capable of producing for themselves. Assistance should be gradually
                            phased down with the objective of ultimate termination.</p>

                        <p>19. Attempt to keep pressures in Japan and in the Ryukyus for reversion
                            within manageable proportions by developing a cooperative relationship
                            with Japan with respect to the Ryukyus to the degree consistent with the
                            indefinite continuation of exclusive U.S. jurisdiction over the islands.
                            Acknowledge the inevitability of substantial Japanese influence in the
                            Ryukyus, and seek to use it constructively to enhance the security of
                            the U.S. bases. Be prepared to accept a substantial Japanese
                            contribution to the economic and social development of the Ryukyus,
                            preferably through the medium of an economic cooperation agreement. The
                            agreement would define, channel and limit the levels and types of
                            Japanese aid activities, while creating the political basis in Japan for
                            Japanese Government acquiescence in continued U.S. administration.</p>
                        <p>20. Conduct our administration of the Ryukyus so as to promote political

                            continued United States rule. To this end,</p>
                        <p>a) Speed up the process of giving responsibility and autonomy to the
                            Government of the Ryukyu Islands and extending the liberties of the
                            Ryukyans to the greatest extent consistent with the High Commissioner's
                            fundamental responsibilities, using the report of Task Force Ryukyus as
                            a policy guide.</p>
                        <p>b) Seek amendment of the Price Act<note n="2" xml:id="d354fn2">See <ref target="#d352fn6">footnote 6, Document 352</ref>.</note> to

                            are agreed upon, at a level substantially higher than in past years as a
                            supplement to local resources in order to support effective
                            administration and long-term economic development of the islands.</p>
                        <p>21. Permit the selective entry of Japanese nationals into U.S.

                        <p>Achievement of U.S. policy objectives in Japan, particularly the
                            maintenance of a close alliance, could be seriously frustrated in the
                            event of the following contingencies:</p>
                        <p>A. A split in the conservative Liberal-Democratic Party or a sustained
                            period of intense factional conflict within the Party, leading to
                            prolonged ineffective conservative rule and greatly intensified
                            vulnerability to leftist extra-parliamentary pressures.</p>
                        <p>B. Socialist assumption of power, followed by neutralization of Japan in
                            accord with current Socialist policies.</p>
                        <pb n="738" xml:id="pg_738" facs="0774"/>
                        <p>C. An open and violent conflict for power between the left and the right,
                            precipitated by continued leftist resort to extra-parliamentary
                            pressures and violence.</p>
                        <p>D. A failure to achieve adequate trade levels with the U.S., Western
                            Europe and other non-Communist countries, particularly as a result
                            either of restrictions against Japanese imports by these countries or of
                            a major world-wide economic recession.</p>
                        <p>E. Major pressures in Japan and the Ryukyus for reversion of the Ryukyus

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName>'s letter of March 22
                            to you (Tab A)<note n="1" xml:id="d355fn1">This letter, not attached,
                                reports that the primary objective in the negotiations, “from the
                                Defense viewpoint, is to maintain the unhampered use of our forces
                                and facilities on Okinawa” and that the proposed agreement should
                                “provide an arrangement for defining, controlling, limiting and
                                channeling Japanese aid activities, in return for U.S. agreement to
                                permit increased Japanese aid.” The letter concludes that a Japanese
                                commitment subject to annual review by the High Commissioner would
                                be desirable. (Ibid., 794C.0221/3-2262)</note> presents a basic
                            issue which will have to be resolved before we can proceed further with
                            a negotiation with Japan over the Ryukyus.</p>
                        <p>Underlying the Defense position is a fear that Congress will not provide
                            the funds necessary to carry out the programs recommended by the Task
                            Force. There appears to be some basis for this fear, since we understand
                            that Representative Passman<note n="2" xml:id="d355fn2">Otto Passman of
                                Louisiana, member of the House Appropriations Committee and Chairman
                                of its Foreign Aid Subcommittee.</note> has taken a very negative
                            view of the Army's request for even $6 million for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1963. This request was submitted <pb n="739" xml:id="pg_739" facs="0775"/>before the Task Force
                            recommendations for annual programs in the $20 million range were
                            accepted in the Executive Branch.</p>
                        <p>If congressional resistance to increased US assistance to the Ryukyu
                            Islands becomes a serious obstacle, it will be necessary for us to
                            re-think the entire approach to Ryukyuan problems taken by the Task
                            Force. Our failure in the past to provide adequate assistance to the
                            Ryukyus has resulted in Japanese offers of assistance to make up the
                            deficit. This in turn has produced what is in effect a US-Japanese
                            competition for the favor of the Ryukyuan people, with the size of
                            prospective aid programs taken as the measure of concern for Ryukyuan
                            welfare and well-being. If the Executive Branch is unable to obtain the
                            funds from Congress that will permit us to demonstrate that our interest
                            in Ryukyuan welfare more than matches that of Japan, our position in the
                            islands may well become untenable. I consider it essential that we
                            assure ourselves of the congressional support necessary to carry out the
                            Task Force recommendations before entering into negotiations with
                            Japan.</p>
                        <p>The fear of failure with Congress that underlies the Defense position has
                            also produced an unrealistic request to the Department that we try to
                            eliminate competitive undercutting of the US position in the Ryukyus by
                            Japan, while suggesting arrangements for Japanese assistance programs
                            which would have precisely the undesired effect. We agree with Defense
                            that Japanese efforts to outbid us annually for Ryukyuan favor are
                            undesirable and should be eliminated. However, the internal pressures on
                            any Japanese Government are such that it seems highly unlikely that we
                            can eliminate this kind of competitive bidding (1) if Japanese aid
                            programs are determined on an annual basis and (2) if, in Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName>'s words, “Japanese aid must
                            be kept in a sound relationship to annual US aid programs.” The Defense
                            suggestion (see paragraph 6 of the attachment to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName>'s letter)<note n="3" xml:id="d355fn3">This attachment sets forth specific comments on the
                                draft U.S.-Japan agreement on Ryukyus assistance. The draft is dated
                                December 15 and is attached to <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>'s memorandum as Tab C.</note> that we
                            obtain an over-all five-year commitment from the Japanese as to their
                            aid program, with this commitment subject to annual renegotiation
                            (probably downward to keep it well below the US aid figure), seems
                            guaranteed to increase Ryukyuan dissatisfaction with our administration
                            as well as expose as a sham our profession of a desire to cooperate with
                            Japan.</p>
                        <p>The concept of working by five-year periods, incorporated in the draft
                            agreement used by the Task Force in its deliberations, would largely
                            eliminate this concern with competitive bidding, but it would require an
                            advance five-year commitment by the US on aid programs to the Ryukyus, a
                            commitment Defense seems reluctant to undertake. If we feel we cannot
                            generate the necessary support in Congress and must <pb n="740" xml:id="pg_740" facs="0776"/>therefore tailor Japanese aid levels to
                            our own on an annual basis, I see no prospect of avoiding annual
                            Japanese efforts to outbid us as benefactors of the Ryukyus.</p>
                        <p>There are two other aspects of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName>'s letter that deserve mention. First, the
                            philosophy underlying the letter is clearly out of phase with the spirit
                            of the President's statement of March 19 (Tab B).<note n="4" xml:id="d355fn4">See <ref target="#d352fn4">footnote 4, Document
                                    352</ref>.</note> Language identical to that in the President's
                            statement acknowledging our responsibility to “minimize the stresses
                            that will accompany the anticipated eventual restoration of the Ryukyu
                            Islands to Japanese administration” has been deleted by Defense from the
                            proposed draft agreement (Tab C) “to avoid creating any new basis for
                            increased reversionism.” (See paragraph 1 of the attachment to Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName>'s letter.) The
                            President's statement reflects the belief that reversionism can best be
                            contained by recognizing the inevitability of close ties between the
                            Ryukyus and Japan and tailoring our policies accordingly. It appears
                            that the Department of Defense has not yet accepted this change in US
                            policy. Secondly, the Department of Defense suggests that specific
                            arrangements on the agreement with Japan be worked out by Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_REO1">Reischauer</persName> and General
                            Caraway on the basis of criteria agreed between the Departments of State
                            and Defense. This position is not inconsistent with our own thinking,
                            but overlooks the fact that the Department of State cannot delegate to
                            an ambassador abroad responsibility for all aspects of an international
                            agreement. The Defense position does, however, lay the basis for the
                            type of State-Defense coordination recommended to you in our memorandum
                            of March 9 (Tab D).<note n="5" xml:id="d355fn5">Memorandum to

                        <p>1. A discussion with Defense and the White House of the prospects for
                            congressional support, of possible means for insuring greater
                            congressional support if this appears necessary, and of the implications
                            for our position in the Ryukyus if such support is not forthcoming.</p>

                        <p>2. If the necessary assurances of congressional support are received, we
                            should proceed with plans for a negotiation with Japan on the basis of
                            five-year aid commitments by both parties. If not, our whole Ryukyuan
                            policy will have to be reviewed.</p>
                        <p>3. Assuming a positive outcome, we should seek Defense concurrence to an
                            initial negotiating instruction which would incorporate as far as
                            possible the concerns expressed in Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName>'s letter but would thereafter leave the

                            number of Asian countries. The section on Japan reads:</p>
                        <p>“I looked at Japan primarily from the point of view of the military asset
                            which it represents for the U.S. Its principal value lies in the
                            military facilities which are made available to the U.S. forces, rather
                            than in the possible participation of its forces in combined operations.
                            In peace, these bases make in important contribution to the efficiency
                            and economy of operation of all U.S. Services. In war, the continuing
                            value of these bases is uncertain. In limited war, it is likely that the
                            Japanese would permit the U.S. to continue to use these facilities
                            provided the U.S. moves no nuclear weapons into or out of Japan. Since
                            our primary enemy in the Far East is Red China and it would probably be
                            necessary to use atomic weapons in an all-out war with that enemy, the
                            foregoing is a serious limitation on the usefulness of Japanese bases.
                            In case of general nuclear war of the kind envisaged in the <gloss target="#t_SIOP1">SIOP</gloss>, the contribution of the Japanese
                            bases would have little significance on the world-wide situation.</p>
                        <pb n="742" xml:id="pg_742" facs="0778"/>
                        <p>“If the foregoing evaluation is correct, there is no justification for
                            the U.S. to pay any great price for U.S. bases in Japan. This fact, plus
                            the continued apathy of the Japanese toward the requirements of their
                            own self defense makes Japan a poor bet as a military ally, and causes
                            one to conclude that military considerations need not shape U.S.
                            relations with Japan.”</p>
                        <p>After reading this cable, President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> sent <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss> No.
                            188 to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>:
                            “General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>'s summary about
                            the limited benefit of bases in Japan reinforces, I believe, the
                            necessity for tightening dollar expenditures there where, I understand,
                            we spend $350 million per year. I know this is a matter the Department
                            of Defense is looking into. Does it appear that a saving can be
                            made?”</p>

                            that he was convinced savings could be made, although while studies were
                            underway, it was too early to be precise about the amounts. Regarding

                        <p>On October 4, 1962, the President signed Public Law 87-746, which raised
                            the annual authorization ceiling on U.S. economic aid to the Ryukyus
                            from $6 to $12 million. The lower ceiling, far short of the $25 million
                            authorization ceiling that the administration had requested, came at the
                            initiative of the Senate Armed Services Committee, which was “inclined
                            to believe that the level of assistance [was] being accelerated too
                            rapidly” and hoped that there would be “no [administration] proposal to
                            increase the authorization ceiling next year.” (Quotations from the
                            Committee's report to the full Senate as reported in telegram 663 to
                            Tokyo, September 21; Department of State, Central Files,

                        <p>Although the administration had requested $12 million in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1963 appropriations for Ryukyuan aid, the
                            House Appropriations Committee recommended only $6 million and the
                            Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $9 million. After the
                            respective Houses had approved these figures, a conference committee set
                            a final total, excluding administrative expenses, of $6,95 million, only
                            $950,000 over the previous ceiling.</p>

                        <p>In an October 6 letter to U. Alexis Johnson, Gerald Warner, Political
                            Adviser to the High Commissioner in the Ryukyus, stated that the
                            congressionally approved amounts, although lower than the
                            administration's requests, did not necessarily mean that the President's
                            policy for the Ryukyus had been undercut: “For one thing the <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> is not too anxious to have the Ryukyus
                            revert too quickly. They know a good thing defense wise and economy wise
                            when they see it. They don't want to have the Okinawans living too high
                            off the hog while we are here, and thus have the Okinawans squealing
                            even louder after reversion than they do now. So all in all the
                            situation does not look too bad. I think we can and should put a
                            favorable face on it.” (Ibid., 811.0094C/10-662)</p>
                        <p>In an October 30 memorandum to the Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> recommended that “in view of the
                            disappointingly small aid appropriation for the Ryukyus” <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> issue a statement stressing that
                            there had been no change in the President's policy as announced March 19
                            (see <ref target="#d352">Document 352</ref>) and that U.S.-Japanese
                            discussions on the subject would continue. (Ibid., 794C.0221/10-3062)

                                the past. We should make it clear that if Japan is to be a leading
                                and active participant among the developed nations of the world, it
                                must pursue liberal trade policies. The Under Secretary has noted
                                that the Japanese record of restrictions is in many ways worse than

                        <p>DEAR GOVERNOR <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">HARRIMAN</persName>: During his

                            Japan might be open to question. General Smart,<note n="1" xml:id="d359fn1">General Jacob Smart, <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss>, COMUSJAPAN.</note> who has mentioned to me his
                            conversation with you in Washington, has now provided me with a brief
                            summary of General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>'s
                            report to the President.<note n="2" xml:id="d359fn2">See <ref target="#d356">Document 356</ref>.</note> He has also shown me a
                            telegram from Admiral Felt to the Joint Chiefs of Staff<note n="3" xml:id="d359fn3">Not found.</note> which makes a forceful and
                            convincing military case for the retention of bases in Japan. I have no

                            might be of some use to you if your man on the spot provided you with
                            his view of the question.</p>
                        <p>It seems to me that General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> has asked himself the wrong question and has
                            therefore come up with the wrong answer. The question he seems to be
                            asking is. “Disregarding Japan itself, of what value to the United
                            States defense position are our bases in Japan?” Even accepting his
                            question in this form, I would not myself be in agreement with his
                            answer. I have been given to understand by many military authorities,
                            including General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>'s
                            immediate predecessor as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,<note n="4" xml:id="d359fn4">General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lyman L.
                                    Lemnitzer</persName>, <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss>.</note> that without the Japanese bases our military
                            position in Korea would be quite impossible to maintain and our
                            positions further to the south would be seriously weakened.</p>
                        <p>The real problem, however, is the nature of the question to which General
                                <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> has addressed
                            himself. For one thing, are we concerned only with the immediate value
                            of our bases and not with their potential value in the foreseeable
                            future? Even accepting General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>'s low estimate of the current value of the
                            bases—and I for one would rate their deterrent value much more highly
                            than he does—should this estimate automatically apply to their value
                            five years or even two years hence? I think not. The outbreak of
                            warfare, whether non-nuclear, limited, or universal, would have its
                            special background, and depending on what that background is and what
                            the public and official reaction to this is in Japan, our bases here may
                            prove to have much greater utility than General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> estimates. Moreover, there is
                            good reason to believe that the general drift of Japanese attitudes is
                            in the right direction and that, as a result, <pb n="745" xml:id="pg_745" facs="0781"/>two years from now our bases will be of
                            greater value in a war situation than they are today and that five years
                            from now they will be of even greater value.</p>
                        <p>What basically bothers me, though, is General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>'s apparent omission in his
                            calculations of the importance of these bases in the defense of Japan
                            itself and in the developing political situation here. Friendly Japanese
                            cooperation with the United States seems to me central to our whole
                            position—military, political and economic—in the Far East, or, to put it
                            negatively, Japan's adherence to the Communist bloc or even strict
                            neutralism on its part would play havoc with our whole position in this
                            part of the world. The primary role of our bases in Japan, I feel, is to
                            help insure that this country does not fall or gravitate into Communist
                            hands or into a neutralist position, but General Taylor seems to be
                            judging them solely on their secondary value as bases for the defense of
                            other areas in the Far East.</p>
                        <p>Even if it were established that our bases are not needed for the defense
                            of Japan—and General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>
                            apparently is not even raising this question—there would still be strong
                            political reasons for moving with great caution in reducing their size
                            and number, because any action of this sort would be likely to make the
                            Japanese feel that we were abandoning them and would thus encourage a
                            movement toward neutralism or alignment with the Communist camp. Without
                            doubt such action would seriously damage the position of the present
                            pro-American conservative leadership in Japan, and it probably would set
                            in motion a train of adverse reactions here that could not be easily
                            stopped. Parenthetically, I might add that any drift of the Japanese
                            away from us would have serious repercussions in Okinawa which would, in
                            my opinion, seriously impair the value of our bases there.</p>
                        <p>I could say a great deal more about the grave political as well as
                            military consequences to Japan and to our whole position in the Far East
                            if any decision were taken to cut down significantly on our bases here.
                            The main point I wish to make, however, is that, if such a decision were
                            taken without due consideration of the military and political bearing of
                            these bases on Japan's future, it would indeed be a case of throwing out
                            the baby with the bath water.</p>

                        <p>United States Investment in Japan</p>
                        <p>Although U.S. investment interest in Japan has been and continues to be
                            active, the Japanese Government has been successful in restricting and
                            channeling such investments to fields and levels considered by the
                            Government to be consistent with its economic and commercial objectives.
                            The Government has thus tended to encourage technological assistance
                            contracts at the same time that only a minimum amount of equity
                            investment has been approved.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">United States Position</p>
                        <p>1. The United States believes that the growth in the Japanese economy and
                            in Japanese exports over the past decade has been due in great measure
                            to the large number of technological assistance contracts concluded with
                            American companies. Benefits have also been derived from American equity
                            investment, which unfortunately has not been of the magnitude which
                            would have been possible had Japanese regulations been administered in a
                            less restrictive manner.</p>
                        <p>2. Now that Japan has a strong economy and has succeeded in vastly
                            improving its balance-of-payments position, such limitations on foreign
                            equity investment can no longer be considered justified. Nor, in view of
                            the worldwide movement on the part of developed countries toward a freer
                            flow of trade and capital, can Japan afford to continue to isolate its
                            business from the benefits which such investment can provide. Japan is a
                            capital-short country and many mutually profitable enterprises have been
                            under consideration. American investors cannot be <pb n="747" xml:id="pg_747" facs="0783"/>expected to provide capital to Japan
                            unless they are assured of the right to convert income into dollars and
                            ultimately to repatriate capital.</p>
                        <p>3. In this connection, the United States would consider modification of
                            Article XII of the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation,<note n="2" xml:id="d360fn2">For text of this treaty, signed at Tokyo on
                                April 2, 1953, and entered into force on October 30, 1963, see 4
                                    <gloss target="#t_UST1">UST</gloss> (pt. 2) 2063. Article XII
                                requires the parties not to impose restrictions on transfers of
                                foreign exchange except when necessary to prevent monetary reserves
                                from “falling to a very low level” or to effect “a moderate increase
                                in very low reserves.” It sets guidelines for foreign exchange
                                restrictions when imposed. Documents in Department of State, Central
                                Files 611.9442 and 394.41 for the fall of 1962 indicate the interest
                                of some Japanese officials in a revision of the FCN Treaty that
                                would allow the parties greater power to regulate direct investment
                                and other capital transfers.</note> or the equivalent through less
                            formal means, to be a regressive step. Publicity accompanying such a
                            restrictive effort on Japan's part would undoubtedly have an adverse
                            effect on Japan's economic relations with both the United States and
                            other free world countries.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Japanese Position</p>
                        <p>1. The question of relaxing controls on the entry of private foreign
                            equity investment is a difficult one for the Japanese Government. If, as
                            a result of an <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> decision, Japan is
                            classified as an “Article VIII country,”<note n="3" xml:id="d360fn3">Reference is to Article VIII of the Articles of Agreement of the
                                International Monetary Fund, signed at Washington on December 27,
                                1945, and effective for the United States that day. For text, see 60
                                Stat. (pt. 3) p. 1411. Article VIII pledges members to avoid
                                multiple exchange rates and other restrictions on foreign exchange
                                and to make their currencies freely convertible. Many members of the
                                fund, including Japan, were able to join it in advance of full
                                adherence to Article VIII.</note> it may be anticipated that the
                            inflow of foreign investments will rise substantially because Japan will
                            no longer be able to restrict the outflow of current earnings from such
                            investments. Some transitional arrangements would be necessary to assist
                            Japanese industries in adjusting to the new situation.</p>
                        <p>2. Contrary to some opinions, there are many weak points in the Japanese
                            economy, and the Japanese Government considers it essential to the
                            future economic growth of the country that foreign capital not be
                            permitted entry on an indiscriminate basis. For this reason, the
                            Government hopes that Japan will be enabled to continue reasonable
                            restrictions on foreign equity investment, particularly since soundness
                            of the Japanese economy is a matter of much concern not only to the
                            Japanese Government but to the United States Government as well.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary remarked that there was one matter he would like to discuss
                            in a very discreet way and not as part of the Joint Committee conference
                            or to be mentioned in the Communique. It was a matter to which the
                            President had referred at lunch today.<note n="1" xml:id="d362fn1">In
                                his public remarks at the luncheon <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> referred to the problem of containing “the
                                expansion of Communism in Asia, so that we do not find the Chinese
                                moving out into a dominant position in all of Asia, with its
                                hundreds and hundreds of millions of people in Asia, while Western
                                Europe is building a more prosperous life for themselves.” China was
                                in a “belligerent phase” of “national development,” and <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> expressed hope that thought
                                could be given to what role the United States and Japan could play
                                as “partners” to “attempt to prevent the domination of Asia by
                                Communist movement.” For text, see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers

                                “that it was his personal opinion that the United States should
                                leave Communist China alone. Making too much fuss about it only
                                served to raise its prestige.” <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> “responded that the United States will leave

                                the United States must be concerned.” (Memorandum of conversation by

                        <p>As we look ahead into the immediate future it appears that it is now
                            Peiping which will pose a grave problem with respect to security in the
                            far Pacific area. As the influence of Communist China increases it can
                            exert more pressure through North Korea and North Viet Nam and its
                            increasingly aggressive attitude toward India as well as the nature of
                            its differences with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> all
                            indicate a growing threat to security. If, in addition, Peiping acquires
                            a nuclear weapons capacity—and we are fully confident they are trying to
                            do so—the danger which now exists in the Pacific area will be
                            immeasurably increased. We fear we must all take this threat seriously.
                            President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>, after taking
                            office, has increased the Eisenhower defense budget almost 25 percent or
                            $10 billion. We have 16,000 men in Southeast Asia and are taking
                            casualties almost every week in the struggle to protect the security of
                            that area. We might hope to obtain a test-ban treaty which could
                            forestall Chinese development of nuclear weapons or an agreement under
                            which other nations would not supply nuclear weapons to China. But even
                            if we would get an international agreement calculated to forestall the
                            Communist Chinese, there is every indication that China would under no
                            circumstances subscribe to any such agreement. I realize these are
                            matters on which you would want to confer with Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> because of their extreme gravity.
                            We do wish, however, to raise the possibility of Japan increasing her
                            defense contribution faster than is planned at present; not just because
                            we all need all the strength we can muster, but also because such an
                            increase would serve as a signal to Moscow and Peiping that Japan, the
                            United States, and the free world would resist any attempt by them to
                            embark on aggression. It would help contribute to maintaining peace
                            while Peiping and Moscow are determining what to do.</p>
                        <p>We shall be called upon to increase our own effort overseas during this
                            period. Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>'s
                            report of his trip to India makes it quite clear that India will require
                            large scale assistance.</p>
                        <p>We would like to see Japan minimize the cost to the United States of the
                            increased Japanese defense program because of the increasing major
                            burdens the United States is now called upon to carry both internally
                            and externally. To me personally, it is a tragedy for the United States
                            and Japan to be obliged to discuss this problem with each other—we have
                                <pb n="751" xml:id="pg_751" facs="0787"/>both been working for a
                            world in which this problem ought not to arise. But because Moscow and
                            Peiping present an increasingly serious danger, if we are to prevent a
                            catastrophe we must let the other side know that their aggression cannot
                            succeed.</p>
                        <p>I fully understand the long and special history of this subject in Japan.
                            As a matter of fact I negotiated in 1952 the first administrative
                            agreement relating to our defense forces in Japan. Since then I have
                            followed this subject closely. Could you indicate what significance is
                            accorded in Japan to these security developments in the Pacific
                            area?</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said that President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> had asked him a similar question at luncheon.
                            The Japanese know that the time has come to consider this problem
                            separately, because apart from receiving aid from the United States
                            Japan herself must consider her own defense. Both the Finance Minister
                            and I replied in that sense to the President's question. In summary, up
                            until now, it has been the Japanese view that if Japan maintains
                            internal peace and economic stability that this self-sufficiency would
                            in itself serve the purposes of the free world and would contribute to
                            stabilization of countries in the Far East. But as I just said we
                            realize the time has come for Japan to reconsider this problem. As you
                            know, we developed our second defense plan last year under which there
                            would be an annual increase of more than $50 million in our defense
                            expenditures. This was done with the approval of the Finance Minister
                            but there will be some difficulties with this plan because our original
                            plan has not been “digested” that is, completed, as yet; consequently,
                            there is some discrepancy between the two plans. As you know, there has
                            been a wage increase for the self-defense forces and perhaps half of our
                            military budget increase will be absorbed by it. Through the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>, the Pentagon has been gradually
                            cutting down on its assistance to us. Therefore we must reconsider our
                            second defense plan. At this time we must regard the problem, as the
                            Secretary has indicated, as a most serious one. I would like to discuss
                            it with the Finance Minister and we must ask the Prime Minister to
                            consider it.</p>
                        <p>Minister Tanaka said he was in agreement with Minister <persName corresp="#p_OM1">Ohira</persName>'s expression of the need to
                            strengthen Japan's defenses. He, Tanaka, understood the problem quite
                            well and wondered whether the United States had a proposal to make on
                            what Japan might do. In making up the Japanese budget they would give
                            such a proposal emphatic consideration.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that the United States had in mind, first, whether
                            Japan could increase its total defense effort at a rate faster than
                            presently planned so as to contribute to the general strength of the
                            free nations; second, whether Japan could find a way to relieve the
                            United States of the military assistance increments—this would be
                            helpful at a time when we must try to increase our aid efforts in India
                            and South Viet Nam; and <pb n="752" xml:id="pg_752" facs="0788"/>third,
                            whether Japan could find a way to take into account the local costs
                            borne by the United States in maintaining its forces in Japan.</p>
                        <p>Since there were important matters requiring close study by both our
                            governments, he had no wish to formulate proposals at this time,
                            considering the great delicacy which the subject has in Japanese
                            political life. Ambassador Reischauer could discuss later in Tokyo the
                            details of what we have in mind. If further meetings are needed, we can
                            hold them but we want to do this in a manner most convenient to you
                            because of the internal political situation which we understand quite
                            well.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary added with a smile that the President and he had not
                            concerted to take up this matter both at lunch and here. The fact that
                            both did so was only an indication of how much the matter was on their
                            minds.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> observed that if
                            Japan should reach a decision to increase its defense effort we would
                            think it possible to find various items which could be purchased in the
                            United States more cheaply than they could be manufactured in Japan,
                            particularly in fields such as aircraft, electronics and anti-aircraft
                                missiles.<note n="3" xml:id="d362fn3">According to telegram 895 to

                            the United States with Germany and Italy. In their negotiation the
                            Treasury took no part, considering the Pentagon was in a better position
                            to determine what was the best course.</p>
                        <p>Our Mutual Defense program has developed this way in Europe and one
                            incidental effect has been to relieve our balance of payments problem.
                            That, however, is not the approach we used in making the arrangements,
                            which were undertaken with the intention of helping Germany and Italy.
                            It might work the same way in Japan if we should decide to move ahead.
                            Our Pentagon and your defense officials might well make the same type of
                            arrangements.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> commented that Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> should be briefed
                            on the growing sophistication of weapons in Mainland China and that it
                            would be desirable to arrange such a briefing for him.</p>
                        <p>Deputy Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName> wished
                            to make two points: first, in this era of nuclear weapons there is an
                            even greater need for conventional weapons. In increasing our own
                            defense budget there has been a 10 percent increase for conventional
                            arms. The Pentagon views the future threat not so much as nuclear as one
                            involving conventional weapons—witness the recent events on the
                            Sino-Indian frontier and in the Caribbean area. What Japan faces is not
                            primarily a nuclear threat. There does <pb n="753" xml:id="pg_753" facs="0789"/>exist in the free world a United States nuclear
                            deterrent which serves all of the free nations, but in the conventional
                            weapons field each nation should provide for some of its own defense, as
                            Japan has done, for example, with Hawk missiles and other advanced
                            non-nuclear weapons systems. (The Secretary here mentioned in addition
                            anti-submarine equipment.) The Soviet Union is putting 20 percent of its
                            military budget into conventional weapons systems and our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies are pursuing a similar course.
                            Therefore we think you need to spend more on conventional weapons.</p>
                        <p>As a second consideration, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName> said, he wished to emphasize the real benefit
                            of cooperative logistic arrangements such as had been set up with
                            Germany and Italy—joint planning, training, and development of weapons
                            systems. Then if we had to use the weapons for defense your weapons and
                            ours could be used interchangeably. In the case of Germany and
                            especially Italy we have gained over the past two years major results at
                            a lower cost than either could have achieved alone. In the same sense
                            your military colleagues will find that these cooperative logistic
                            arrangements will permit our two nations to work closely toward the
                            common purpose of national defense.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that the United States was not raising the possibility
                            of Japan preparing an expeditionary force to serve outside of Japan but
                            had in mind only the question of the defense of Japan, Even that,
                            however, is a problem. In 1954 the United States had a practical
                            monopoly of nuclear weapons, under which we could always say that if
                            Japan is the victim of aggression the United States will retaliate. Now
                            the other side also has the means of delivery, in Asia as well as in
                            Europe. A nuclear exchange is not a defense operation we would want to
                            undertake. Consequently the separate threat of superiority in
                            conventional weapons means that Japan is in effect held a hostage while
                            China moves in Southeast Asia and elsewhere. Therefore he wanted a
                            review for the Prime Minister of the changes in the past 4 or 5 years.
                            The Secretary regretted that he had no words of comfort to give the
                            Finance Minister, Mr. Tanaka, except to point out that Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> himself is facing a $7
                            billion deficit while Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName> is taking $10 billion more for the defense
                            budget.</p>
                        <p>Vice Minister <persName corresp="#p_TR1">Takeuchi</persName> asked
                            whether the Japanese military had been briefed on the new development of
                            sophisticated weapons on the mainland. The Secretary said that the
                            subject had not been previously raised with the Japanese Government.
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_TR1">Takeuchi</persName> pointed out that
                            if Prime Minister were briefed on such a technical subject he would have
                            to seek advice of his military advisors. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> agreed that the Prime Minister
                            would certainly wish to consult Director-General Shiga of the Defense
                            Agency.</p>
                        <pb n="754" xml:id="pg_754" facs="0790"/>
                        <p>It was agreed that the conversation would not be considered a part of the
                            Joint Committee conference and would not figure in the record of the
                            conference; and that there should be no disclosure that any substantive
                            conversations at all had been held.</p>

                        <p>A friendly and relaxed atmosphere prevailed throughout the luncheon. The
                            only specific problem discussed at significant length concerned the
                            American side's request that Japan take action to relieve the distress
                            of American copper smelting companies.<note n="1" xml:id="d363fn1">Documentation on this problem is ibid., 494.004, 494.006, 494.42,

                            Tokyo. Otherwise, discussion of a substantive nature focussed upon the
                            American desire that Japan take further action to liberalize trade and
                            the Japanese desire for information on American trade policy and how it
                            would be implemented in the future.</p>
                        <p>[Here follows discussion of Japanese purchase of copper ores and
                            concentrates.]</p>
                        <p>United States Foreign Trade Policy and Trade Liberalization by Japan</p>
                        <p>As the luncheon began, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Gudeman</persName> alluded briefly to the investment made by
                                <persName corresp="#p_BDE1">Bell</persName> and Howell in a Japanese
                            firm as an example of mutually beneficial American investment in
                            Japan.</p>
                        <p>A question from <persName corresp="#p_FH1">Fukuda</persName> about
                            pictures on the wall of vintage American automobiles led to some
                            discussion of automobile prices in Japan and Japanese duties on imports
                            of American cars, particularly on compacts as compared with the German
                            Volkswagen. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Gudeman</persName> took
                            the opportunity of casually pointing out that American car imports are
                            one item which the United States would like Japan to liberalize.
                                <persName corresp="#p_FH1">Fukuda</persName> responded by citing the
                            narrow and congested condition of Japanese roads as one reason why Japan
                            is restricting American car imports. In response to a question from
                                <persName corresp="#p_FH1">Fukuda</persName>, Matsumura said that
                            American compacts are being imported by Japan and commented that the
                            base price of American compacts is higher than that of the Volkswagen.
                            Assistant Secretary Behrman observed that the American compact is placed
                            in a higher domestic Japanese tax category than the Volkswagen.
                                <persName corresp="#p_FH1">Fukuda</persName> then expressed, in
                            Japanese, some doubt to Matsumura as to the reasonableness of the
                            Japanese policy of determining the automobile tax on the basis of
                            horsepower.</p>
                        <p>In offering a toast at the end of the luncheon, Secretary Gudeman
                            emphasized the American belief that trade and economic relations should
                            be viewed as having two aspects: short-range and long-range. There is
                            often a conflict between the two, exemplified at present by the measures
                            which the United States feels obliged to take in view of its balance of
                            payments problem. The Trade Expansion Act, on the other hand, is an
                            example of long-range United States policy. The United States is aware
                            of Japan's disagreement with short-range United States policies in such
                            areas as the Buy American policy, shipping, and textiles but hopes Japan
                            will understand why these policies have had to be adopted. The United
                            States and Japan each wish the other to be its leading customer. Both
                            countries have a common interest in freer trade as the means of
                            achieving higher standards of living and have a common interest in
                            partnership vis-a-vis the totalitarian world.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_FH1">Fukuda</persName>, in his toast, said the
                            relationship between Japan and the United States is such that the two
                            countries cannot be separated, whatever <pb n="756" xml:id="pg_756" facs="0792"/>happens. Japanese deeply regret Pearl Harbor and are
                            very grateful for the generosity which the United States showed, in
                            spite of Pearl Harbor, during the Occupation of Japan. Japan, he said,
                            well knows how much the Japanese economy depends upon the United States.
                            He shares Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Gudeman</persName>'s view
                            of the importance for the future of cooperation between the two
                            countries in order to raise standards of living. Regardless of problems
                            existing between Japan and the United States at present, they do not and
                            ought not interfere with United States-Japan friendship and with their
                            long-term relations.</p>
                        <p>In the discussion which followed the luncheon, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Gudeman</persName> offered to answer any questions
                            the Japanese might have regarding the Trade Expansion Act. <persName corresp="#p_FH1">Fukuda</persName> then asked to what extent
                            adjustment assistance would be provided to American companies. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Gudeman</persName> pointed out that this
                            is a new law and that negotiations under the Act with foreign countries
                            have not as yet begun. It is our hope, he said, that any adjustments in
                            the United States will be made under the trade adjustment part of the
                            Act rather than through increases in tariffs. We recognize that higher
                            tariffs protect the least efficient manufacturers and for this reason
                            the new law contains no peril point provision, unlike previous
                            legislation. We also recognize that, to a degree as yet unknown, certain
                            American companies will be hurt by the negotiation of lower tariffs.
                            Companies which are injured through the action of the United States
                            Government and not through any action of their own must be given
                            assistance. Assistance to labor, such as labor retraining programs, is
                            the responsibility of the Department of Labor. The Department of
                            Commerce is responsible for assistance to business and is all ready for
                            the problem when it arises, having put a man on the staff 6-7 months ago
                            to study methods of assistance.</p>
                        <p>Assistant Secretary Behrman pointed out that there are many in the
                            American business community who do not like the system of adjustment
                            assistance provided for by the Act. They can be expected to press for
                            higher tariffs. In this connection, the Japanese should be aware that
                            the new Act provides for an industry-wide investigation whenever one
                            company appeals for a rise in tariff. Japanese should not be concerned
                            when they hear of such investigations because it is the final decision,
                            and not the investigation, which truly reflects current United States
                            trade policy.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Gudeman</persName> then described
                            the steps whereby the Tariff Commission investigates an appeal for a
                            higher tariff and submits a recommendation to the President who makes
                            the final decision whether or not to change a tariff or, alternatively,
                            to provide adjustment assistance under the Act. Mr. Braderman then
                            emphasized to the Japanese guests his observation over twelve years that
                            Japanese concern over protectionism in the United States has been
                            sparked by sensational and inaccurate <pb n="757" xml:id="pg_757" facs="0793"/>Japanese press reports of Tariff Commission
                            recommendations and not by the final decisions that were taken.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_FH1">Fukuda</persName> replied by saying
                            that Japan is prepared to cooperate in the implementation of the Trade
                            Expansion Act. He wished, however, to reiterate one point; namely, the
                            cooperation of the maximum number of countries would be needed in order
                            to realize the purpose of the Act to the fullest extent. He understood
                            the principle of expanding trade on the basis of lower tariffs and
                            higher consumption. The United States should recognize, however, that
                            the various countries have different problems according to their stage
                            of economic development. In this connection, he referred to Japan as
                            being in the category of middle development. In illustration, he
                            suggested the possible analogy of the movement of a fleet wherein the
                            pace must be set by the slowest ship and not by the fastest in order
                            that the fleet move together. He hoped the United States would give
                            further study to this point in its implementation of the Act.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Gudeman</persName> responded with
                            the hope that Japan would liberalize its view of worldwide trade and
                            jokingly accused Minister <persName corresp="#p_FH1">Fukuda</persName>
                            of not giving due credit to Japan in placing Japan in the category of
                            middle development.</p>
                        <p>Assistant Secretary Behrman observed that there are times when a country
                            can benefit from unilateral tariff concessions; namely, under conditions
                            of full employment and a worldwide growth in trade. The United States
                            intends to lead the world toward a worldwide reduction in tariffs but,
                            since it has problems of its own, it is not in a position to lead
                            without assistance from other countries.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>1. Reference is made to your memorandum, dated 1 October 1962,<note n="1" xml:id="d365fn1">See <ref target="#d356">Document 356</ref>.</note>
                            subject as above, in which you requested the views of the Joint Chiefs
                            of Staff on the role of US bases in Japan in peacetime, and in
                            sub-limited, limited, and general war.</p>
                        <p>2. The Joint Chiefs of Staff have examined the role of these bases in
                            peacetime and in the various conditions of war. The results of this
                            examination are detailed in the Appendix hereto.<note n="2" xml:id="d365fn2">See the Supplement.</note> It is concluded that the
                            principal roles of US bases in Japan are as follows:</p>
                        <p>a. Essential to the maintenance of the US deterrent posture in the Far
                            East; required for the support of the US position in Korea; permit rapid
                            tactical deployment of forces in the Western Pacific.</p>
                        <p>b. Provide primary logistic support to the entire Far East area and key
                            repair facilities not available elsewhere in the area.</p>
                        <p>c. Provide essential intelligence gathering and reporting facilities and
                            opportunities, as well as communications for command and control.</p>
                        <p>d. Provide facilities in northeast Asia necessary to maintain and support
                            the <gloss target="#t_SIOP1">SIOP</gloss> posture.</p>
                        <p>e. Provide dispersion of stocks and bases for projection of residual
                            power after an initial nuclear exchange.</p>
                        <p>f. Complicate the Soviet nuclear targeting problem.</p>
                        <p>g. Provide an important link in the maintenance and improvement of
                            US-Japanese political, economic, and military relations.</p>
                        <p>3. In examining the desirability of retaining the Japanese bases, the
                            unfavorable aspects of their continued use, as set forth hereinafter,
                            must be weighed against the disadvantages associated with a withdrawal
                            therefrom. The most important of these are:</p>
                        <p>a. It would reduce the forward strategy deterrent posture in the Far East
                            with possible attendant loss of confidence by US Allies and nonaligned
                            neutrals.</p>
                        <pb n="762" xml:id="pg_762" facs="0798"/>
                        <p>b. A victory would result for neutralist forces in Japan and for the
                            Communist world-wide drive against US overseas bases with concomitant
                            unfavorable effect on our Allies.</p>
                        <p>c. Dispersal of forces which Japan now affords would be lost.</p>
                        <p>d. The Japanese commitment on military force levels would be jeopardized
                            and a neutral Japan could result.</p>
                        <p>e. The ability of military forces to operate in northeast Asia and
                            contiguous waters would be significantly reduced, particularly their
                            capability to react quickly to contingency situations.</p>
                        <p>f. The logistic and combat support of Korea would be extremely
                            difficult.</p>
                        <p>g. Japanese repair facilities and skilled Japanese labor now available
                            would be lost.</p>
                        <p>h. The cost of replacing the present extensive facilities in Japan in
                            other areas would be very great.</p>
                        <p>i. The only large-capacity industrial base in the Far East would not be
                            available for the support of US forces.</p>
                        <p>j. Long lines of communication and difficulties in obtaining real estate
                            and base rights complicate the relocation of these bases to other
                            areas.</p>
                        <p>4. Although, as indicated above, there are a number of important reasons
                            for the maintenance of US bases in Japan, there are also factors which
                            affect the continued maintenance of these bases. The most important of
                            these are:</p>
                        <p>a. US bases in Japan are vulnerable to strikes by those Japanese laborers
                            who are Communist-controlled and the capabilities of the bases might
                            thus be impaired when they are most needed.</p>
                        <p>b. The introduction of nuclear weapons into Japan has not been
                            politically feasible and the prospects of their introduction in
                            peacetime are not promising.</p>
                        <p>c. The cost of maintaining US bases in Japan results in a continuing
                            unfavorable balance of military payments.</p>
                        <p>d. The Japanese have demonstrated apathy toward shouldering the
                            obligations for their own defense.</p>
                        <p>e. The Japanese Security Treaty restricts the deployment of US forces to
                            combat areas without “prior consultation.” This could be a serious
                            limitation on the usefulness of the bases, particularly in limited war
                            where the vital interests of the Japanese were not involved.</p>
                        <p>5. The Joint Chiefs of Staff believe the US bases in Japan contribute
                            significantly to the over-all strategic US posture in the Pacific. On
                            balance, they conclude that the reasons for maintaining these bases
                            outweigh the factors militating against their retention. If a major
                            change were made in US strategy for the Far East, then it might be
                            possible to reduce bases in Japan.</p>
                        <pb n="763" xml:id="pg_763" facs="0799"/>
                        <p>6. It is the judgment of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that US strategic
                            interest requires the retention of the US bases in Japan in essentially
                            their present status.</p>

                            1962, the Government of Japan came within two percentage points of the
                            90% liberalization target which it had committed itself to attain by
                            that date. A further slight gain was registered on November 21, with the
                            liberalization of an additional eight items. Since the 68%
                            liberalization level at the time of the first meeting of the US-Japan
                            Committee on Economics and Trade in November 1961, successive transfers
                            from the restrictive Fund Allocation System have shifted some 728 items
                            to the Automatic Fund Allocation System or to the Automatic Approval
                            list. Two hundred and fifty-four (254) items remain unliberalized.</p>
                        <p>Despite the substantial progress indicated above, Japan still maintains a
                            greater degree of import restrictions than any other major trading
                            nation in the Free World. The measure of liberalization employed by the
                            Government of Japan, through the bias of a weighting system based on <pb n="764" xml:id="pg_764" facs="0800"/>1959 imports, seriously
                            understates the proportion of import trade still subject to quota
                            restrictions. A somewhat more realistic measure of the relative
                            importance of the restricted sector of imports is given by the
                            proportion of the most recent commodity import budget under the Fund
                            Allocation System. For the period October 1, 1962—March 31, 1963, 26% of
                            the commodity import budget falls under <gloss target="#t_FA1">FA</gloss> control.</p>
                        <p>Although Japan has made some progress in the liberalization of
                            manufactured goods, many of the manufactured items which offer the
                            greatest possibilities to American exporters remain on the Negative
                            List. In some of these cases, import license can often be obtained
                            fairly readily, but in others licenses are not obtainable at all or only
                            with much difficulty. It is obvious that in general the remaining
                            controls offer a substantial impediment to American exports.<note n="1" xml:id="d366fn1">Among the items listed in the portion of the

                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> on December 6 proposed a list of
                            projects totalling $5.1 million to be included in the budget (for the
                            fiscal year to begin April 1), for presentation to the Diet, in
                            assistance to the Ryukyus. (This was a reduction from $7.7 million
                            contemplated earlier, which Ambassador Reischauer believed to be too
                            much above the figure the High Commissioner would regard as
                            acceptable.)</p>
                        <p>On December 27 the High Commissioner made counter-proposals which would
                            have had the effect of reducing the total to about $4.7 million.<note n="3" xml:id="d367fn3">According to a December 31 letter from First
                                Secretary of Embassy, James S. Sutterlin to <persName corresp="#p_FRA1">Fearey</persName>, General Caraway's basic
                                reason for wanting to limit the Japanese contribution “was his
                                continuing fear that a Japanese program which was above the 2 to 1
                                ratio foreseen for US and Japanese aid would seriously jeopardize
                                U.S. administrative authority in the Ryukyus.” (Department of State,
                                Central Files, 794C.0221/12-362)</note> This was to be achieved by
                            eliminating a proposed mental hospital; reducing a public housing
                            program; and cutting down projects for training and technical
                            assistance. A Japanese offer of alternative projects was made and
                            rejected, as <gloss target="#t_HICOM1">HICOM</gloss> was not prepared to
                            accept the overall figure of $5.1 million. Since the Japanese budget
                            must be ready for presentation December 29, the Embassy asked for
                            instructions to be sent niact (Tab A—Tokyo's 1529).<note n="4" xml:id="d367fn4">Dated December 28; in it <persName corresp="#p_REO1">Reischauer</persName> strongly recommended the
                                $5.1 million figure because to lower it would render the “U.S. again
                                vulnerable to charges both in Okinawa and Japan of seeking restrict
                                Japanese ‘generosity.’” $5.1 million was less than half of what the
                                United States would request for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                                1964, and “we have had remarkable success in conveying impression in

                                the United States insisted on a further reduction. (Ibid.,

                            generosity to Okinawans, thereby <pb n="766" xml:id="pg_766" facs="0802"/>negating a cooperative relationship envisaged in the President's
                            program for the Ryukyus established last March. At about 8 P.M. last

                            defense relationships, it is my conclusion that the objective of
                            entirely offsetting the present U.S. adverse balance of military
                            expenditures in Japan, now running at well over $300 million a year,
                            through the purchase by the Japanese of U.S. military equipment is
                            unlikely of achievement in the near future, primarily for two
                            reasons:</p>
                        <p>1. The increase in the Japanese defense budget to a level which would
                            permit any large-scale purchasing of U.S. equipment will take a period
                            of years because of the necessity for creating political support by the
                            Japanese people for a sharp acceleration of its defense buildup.</p>
                        <p>2. Even were the necessary funds available to the Japanese defense
                            authorities, there may not be a sufficient amount of U.S. military
                            hardware that the Japanese are likely to purchase to offset our total
                            expenditures. Much of the materiel they need can be supplied out of
                            indigenous production. For example, since the Japanese do not require
                            sophisticated or high performance aircraft they can produce their own
                            fighter and transport planes with the technology they presently possess.
                            Similarly their shipyards are capable of designing and constructing
                            patrol craft, minesweepers and small submarines, the only naval vessels
                            which are planned for the Japanese maritime defense forces. Only for
                            such advanced antiaircraft missile systems as Nike-Ajax, Nike-Hercules
                            and Hawk and electronic gear for ground environment <gloss target="#t_ACW1">ACW</gloss> Systems have the Japanese turned to
                            U.S. sources. Consideration of price has not been a <pb n="768" xml:id="pg_768" facs="0804"/>major factor in Japanese procurement
                            planning in the past. Thus, much of their local production is at prices
                            far in excess of U.S. production costs. If it does become a factor in
                            the future as a result of greater demands on their budget, there may be
                            a larger potentiality for Japanese procurement in the U.S. This
                            possibility, however, cannot be expected to have an effect on the
                            procurement level in the immediate future.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly, under existing circumstances the fastest way that I see for
                            the U.S. to reduce or eliminate its current adverse balance of military
                            expenditures in Japan would be through a series of additional measures,
                            of which the following are examples, aimed at cutting down U.S. dollar
                            outlays in Japan:</p>
                        <p>1. Decreasing the numbers of Air Force personnel and dependents in Japan
                            by rotating, instead of permanently stationing, the U.S. tactical units
                            now in Japan or by repositioning those units in a dollar area such as
                            Okinawa;</p>
                        <p>2. Transferring to the U.S. the home-porting in Japan of naval vessels
                            whose crews with their families now are on permanent station in
                            Japan;</p>
                        <p>3. Thinning out the present Army logistics base in Japan by returning to
                            the continental U.S. support units that would not be needed there prior
                            to D-day; and,</p>
                        <p>4. Removing, transferring to the Japanese, the depot operation now used
                            for <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> support in Japan.</p>
                        <p>Such measures, while reducing the U.S. gold flow to Japan, would
                            undoubtedly increase the U.S. military budget and might impair the
                            capabilities and readiness of U.S. forces in the Far East.</p>
                        <p>A possible alternative course of action for reducing U.S. defense
                            expenditures in Japan would be through a major redeployment of U.S.
                            forces there. This step, however, could lead to the loss of our U.S.
                            bases in Japan which, in the judgment of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
                            should be retained in their present status barring a major change in
                            U.S. strategy for the Far East.</p>
                        <p>In the light of the foregoing analysis of the Japanese situation, it
                            appears that we should revise our goals there as follows:</p>
                        <p>1. We should continue our efforts to persuade the Japanese Government, as
                            rapidly as possible within the political realities that it faces, to
                            increase its defense budget and at the same time to develop those
                            elements of a cooperative logistics plan which would serve to maximize
                            the offsetting of our defense expenditures through Japanese military
                            procurement in the U.S. and sharing of U.S. facilities in Japan.
                            Realistic military sales/cooperative logistics goals for offset would be
                            $50 million for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 64, $100 million for
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 65, and $150 million for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 66.</p>
                        <pb n="769" xml:id="pg_769" facs="0805"/>
                        <p>2. We should redouble our efforts to find ways and means of reducing the
                            balance of payments costs of U.S. military forces in Japan short of a
                            major redeployment of forces. Such efforts would be aimed at achieving a
                            $50 million reduction in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 64, $100
                            million in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 65, and $150 million in
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 66. These actions will undoubtedly
                            affect military readiness and therefore the options available to us to
                            accomplish this end should be carefully considered, along with the
                            recommendations of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, before selecting the
                            particular actions to achieve these goals.</p>
                        <p>With your approval, we will press forward on the following line of action
                            to meet the above objectives:</p>
                        <p>1. The State Department will be requested to follow up on my discussions
                            immediately for the establishment of a bilateral defense study group
                            which will consider all aspects of our cooperative defense program
                            including those related to balance of payments. This group would include
                            representatives from Defense, State and Treasury and appropriate
                            Japanese</p>
                        <p>2. The Defense Department will undertake an analysis of options available
                            to us, by priority, to achieve the U.S. support reductions required to
                            meet the above stated goals.</p>
                        <p>3. The Defense Department will develop an analysis of Japan's defense
                            force missions throughout the period 1964-70 and related modernization
                            requirements as a basis for future bilateral discussions. This analysis
                            will include suggested goals for an accelerated Japanese buildup program
                            and a plan of cooperative logistics including sales designed to achieve
                            the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 64-66 desired offset goals.</p>
                        <p>4. The Defense Department, in conjunction with State and Treasury, will
                            aim at another series of meetings with the Japanese Government by April,
                            hoping to achieve more specific commitments from the Japanese prior to
                            their '64 budget cycle which starts in the fall of '63.</p>

                        <p>MEMORANDUM</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">I.</p>
                        <p>In my meetings with the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister of Japan
                            to review with them in behalf of the President of the United States the
                            general status of international security affairs and the defense of the
                            United States and Japan, I made the following points as reflecting the
                            thinking of the United States Government:</p>
                        <p>—The security of the United States and Japan is a matter of mutual
                            concern to both nations. Unity in developing and maintaining such
                            security over the long run requires a coordinated effort by each nation
                            in a manner commensurate with its political and economic posture in the
                            world.</p>
                        <p>—Japan is one of the most vital strategic centers of the world and as
                            such is a target for Communist attack of both a direct and an indirect
                            nature. A Japan inadequately defended against Communist air or naval
                            blockade might lose much of its independence and could be utilized to
                            project Communist power decisively into the Pacific.</p>
                        <p>—The nuclear power of the U.S. should serve to deter any Communist atomic
                            attack on Japan. However, Soviet and Chinese Communist conventional
                            military forces, including submarines and aircraft, are deployed around
                            waters and land immediately contiguous to Japan. Such forces represent
                            Communist ability to test the strength and resolution of Japan and the
                            U.S. to resist Communist attempts to dominate Japan through limited and
                            conventional means of warfare.</p>
                        <p>—Japan's own self defense, as well as its need to back up its political
                            and economic posture in the world with greater defensive power, make it
                            increasingly necessary that Japan develop as a stronger member of the
                            U.S./Japan partnership.</p>
                        <p>—An expanded Japan/U.S. defense system of cooperation in all matters
                            related to defense and logistic support activities in Japan should be
                            developed. This system of cooperation can be built on the foundations of
                            the existing mutual security agreements and on the close associations
                            previously developed with Japanese authorities.</p>
                        <p>—It is hoped that a defense study group composed of representatives of
                            both governments will be set up to advise their political executives <pb n="771" xml:id="pg_771" facs="0807"/>of both immediate and long term
                            actions which can be taken to develop this system of defense
                            cooperation. Such advice would cover force missions, force requirements,
                            equipment, supporting facilities, supply sources, cost and timing.</p>
                        <p>—It is recognized that defense strength rests on the economic health of
                            both nations. In addition to the other very great costs of maintaining
                            the United States defense posture in and around Japan, over the past ten
                            years we have spent more than $7 billion in procurement by U.S. forces
                            of Japanese equipment, material and services. At the present time,
                            balance of payments has become an economic problem of great significance
                            to both nations. It is therefore hoped that Japan and the U.S. will
                            strive to equalize each other's defense foreign exchange expenditures
                            through reciprocal procurement or barter programs or take other actions
                            designed to minimize the balance of payments effects of the U.S./Japan
                            defense partnership.</p>
                        <p>—The United States Government recognizes that defense expenditures are a
                            problem of particular political sensitivity in Japan and that it would
                            be politically infeasible for Japan to attempt to equal the 9-1/2
                            percent of the gross national product that the United States devotes to
                            defense expenditures or even the somewhat smaller percentages attained
                            by our major European allies. We do, however, believe that it would not
                            be unrealistic for the Government of Japan to aim at an appreciable
                            acceleration of its defense buildup.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">II.</p>
                        <p>In my conversations with the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister they
                            assured me that they were in agreement with the points I had made and
                            were themselves determined to build up Japanese defense capabilities to
                            the maximum that political and economic conditions in Japan would
                            permit. Specifically we agreed on the following two positions:</p>
                        <p>1. The importance of increasing the Japanese defense budget;</p>
                        <p>2. The desirability of establishing a defense study group within the
                            framework of the Security Consultative Committee to pursue our further
                            defense cooperation, including the study of balance of payments effects
                            on our respective foreign exchange expenditures.</p>

                        <p>DEAR ROS: Thank you for your letter of February 8, 1963,<note n="1" xml:id="d369fn1">

                        <p>I am pleased to learn that your visit to Tokyo went so well. Ambassador

                            that substantial progress has been made in our efforts to stimulate a
                            greater Japanese defense effort.<note n="2" xml:id="d369fn2">Telegram

                                    <gloss target="#t_DEF1">DEF</gloss> 1 JAPAN)</note> I believe
                            the decision to form a defense study group holds particular promise, and
                            we are already working to establish it. I understand it is your
                            intention that the additional series of meetings mentioned in the final
                            paragraph of your memorandum to the President would be held in this
                            forum.</p>
                        <p>I believe our efforts so far have demonstrated that we must approach the
                            objective of greater military offsets in Japan by going back to
                            fundamentals—agreeing on the threat and developing therefrom missions,
                            then requirements, then equipment lists, from which will finally emerge
                            opportunities for sales of U.S. military materiel easing our balance of
                            payments situation. The defense study group should be an ideal forum for
                            this approach.</p>
                        <p>The Department of State would of course wish to be consulted about any
                            significant alteration in the U.S. military posture in Japan. As
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_REO1">Reischauer</persName> has pointed
                                out,<note n="3" xml:id="d369fn3">In telegram 1904 from Tokyo,
                                February 14. (Ibid.)</note> reductions producing even relatively
                            small balance of payments savings might severely undermine the
                            confidence of Japan in our determination to maintain strong defenses in
                            the Far East, and thus weaken its desire to maintain its Free World
                            alignment.</p>
                        <p>Finally, I think it should be borne in mind that Japan represents a
                            highly favorable market for United States civilian exports. The
                            principal limiting factor to steadily expanding United States civilian
                            exports to Japan will continue to be Japan's ability to earn the foreign
                            exchange necessary <pb n="773" xml:id="pg_773" facs="0809"/>to pay for

                                copy of this letter, stated in a March 8 letter to <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> that this paragraph implied a
                                direct link between the level of U.S. military expenditures in Japan
                                and Japan remaining a favorable market for U.S. exports, but that
                                such a direct link was “contrary to the principle of multilateral
                                trade and payments” that was “the foundation of our entire
                                international trade and financial policy.” He believed there was no
                                question of the overall adequacy of Japan's foreign currency
                                earnings and its foreign exchange reserves were increasing, and he

                        <p>Problem:</p>
                        <p>On December 28 we levied on Japan a request<note n="1" xml:id="d371fn1">The previous agreement expired on December 31, 1962; see <ref target="#d343fn4">footnote 4, Document 343</ref>.</note> for
                            export restraints in 36 categories (in addition to 3 categories agreed
                            last fall) of cotton textiles for 1963 on the basis of market disruption
                            as provided in Article 3 of the Long-Term Cotton Textile Arrangement
                                (<gloss target="#t_LTA1">LTA</gloss>).<note n="2" xml:id="d371fn2">Dated February 9, 1962; for text of this multilateral arrangement,
                                see 13 <gloss target="#t_UST1">UST</gloss> (pt. 3) 2672. The
                                arrangement entered into force for the United States on October 1,
                                1962.</note> The Japanese have rejected the allegation of market
                            disruption except in 4 categories. There has been a series of exchanges
                            in Washington and Tokyo, the net result of which has left us far from
                            agreement. Our allegation of market disruption on a broad scale has
                            touched off a storm of protest in Japan which has acquired wide
                            political proportions actually threatening damage to our relations with
                            Japan. Moreover, failure to reach early agreement would undoubtedly lead
                            to a confrontation in the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> which
                            probably would destroy the <gloss target="#t_LTA1">LTA</gloss> itself,
                            cause an unpleasant and destructive exchange regarding U.S. trade
                            policy, and seriously affect the prospects for a successful Kennedy
                            Round of Tariff negotiations under the <gloss target="#t_TEA1">TEA</gloss>. We must quickly find a solution which will avoid a
                            confrontation with Japan on issues of principle and permit us to
                            negotiate on the actual level of exports for 1963, such a solution must,
                            of course, provide adequate safeguards and assurance to the U.S.
                            industry.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Issues</p>
                        <p>The basis for Japanese indignation is the fact that the U.S. has
                            “accused” Japan of market disruption on a broad scale (about 90 percent
                            of its exports to the U.S.) in the face of its long record as the only
                            country to exert rigorous restraints on textile exports to the U.S., all
                            of which were worked out in close consultation with the U.S. They are
                            also conscious of the key role they played in support of the U.S. in
                            bringing about the <gloss target="#t_LTA1">LTA</gloss>. Except for 4
                            categories they do not agree that the <gloss target="#t_LTA1">LTA</gloss> definition of market <pb n="775" xml:id="pg_775" facs="0811"/>disruption has been met. It is now apparent that
                            continued efforts to negotiate restraints with the Japanese on the basis
                            of the market disruption principle (Article 3) will not be successful.
                            In the end we would probably be required to take unilateral action to
                            impose import restrictions, which would undoubtedly lead to a
                            confrontation with Japan in the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>After extensive exchanges in Washington and Tokyo regarding
                            interpretation of the <gloss target="#t_LTA1">LTA</gloss>, no agreement
                            in principle has been reached and the Japanese have refused to discuss
                            restraint levels under Article 3. On the basis of a Cabinet decision,
                            which over-rode a Foreign Office recommendation to move directly to
                            negotiation of restraint levels, the Japanese requested U.S. agreement
                            to six points of principle regarding the LTA, after which they would be
                            willing to negotiate restraint levels under Article 4 of the <gloss target="#t_LTA1">LTA</gloss> (which provides for bilateral
                            agreements) (attached).<note n="3" xml:id="d371fn3">Not found
                                attached.</note> It is the consensus in this office and in E that
                            efforts to come to agreement on the six points would be
                            interminable.</p>
                        <p>The Commerce Department prefers the use of Article 3 because of its
                            provision for the imposition of unilateral controls in the event of lack
                            of agreement or breach of agreed ceilings. This they consider to be a
                            valuable “lever” which they do not believe a bilateral agreement under
                            Article 4 would provide. Naturally the Commerce Department feels its
                            responsibility to provide adequate safeguards for the U.S. industry.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Proposed Solution</p>
                        <p>We believe that the best solution lies in our moving away from the market
                            disruption principle and presenting a proposal for agreed restraints
                            under a bilateral agreement. Recent private discussions with the
                            Japanese both here and in Tokyo lead us to the conclusion that a U.S.
                            proposal for negotiation that meets the Japanese objection to the market
                            disruption “accusation” may result in avoidance of a clash on the issues
                            of principle. It is obvious that the Japanese Government's interests lie
                            in avoiding further prolongation of this issue in the public domain, but
                            that it must find a solution which “saves face” on the market disruption
                            issue.</p>
                        <p>A bilateral agreement which provides agreed specific ceilings on all
                            sensitive categories together with an over-all ceiling on all Japanese
                            exports to the U.S. (which is not provided under the market disruption
                            method), would safeguard the U.S. industry against unforeseen disruptive
                            imports from Japan. Although we deal with almost all other countries
                            under Article 3, the unique record of bilateral textile arrangement with
                            Japan since 1957 should adequately explain this departure.</p>
                        <p>We have suggested that a proposal be made to the Japanese for a bilateral

                        <p>After an exchange of amenities, the President commented that a remark he
                            had made to Japanese cabinet ministers during a luncheon last <pb n="778" xml:id="pg_778" facs="0814"/>December<note n="1" xml:id="d375fn1">See <ref target="#d362fn1">footnote 1, Document
                                    362</ref>.</note> about China, had evidently created quite a
                            stir in Japan. He added that he had merely expressed how he felt, and
                            that he still felt the same way. The Ambassador said he recalled the
                            occasion (which was on December 3 in connection with the second meeting
                            of the Joint US-Japan Committee on Trade and Economic Affairs), as he
                            was among those present. The Japanese press, he commented, had examined
                            every word to see what it could read into the statement. (Later on he
                            commented that few Americans realize how free the Japanese press is, and
                            that it is uniformly anti-government—though people have learned to read
                            between the lines.) The President said that some had thought his remarks
                            were intended to be taken in the context of trade, but that this was not
                            what he had in mind.</p>
                        <p>The President adverted to Japan's remarkable economic resurgence and
                            asked the Ambassador what he envisages the role of Japan to be on the
                            world scene, in the years ahead. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TR1">Takeuchi</persName> replied that Japan should serve as an example
                            of economic stability and of successful democratic government. Without
                            social, economic and political progress and stability in Japan, the
                            countries of the area would look elsewhere (by implication, to Communist
                            countries) for their model.</p>
                        <p>There were but passing references to the question of outstanding problems
                            in US-Japan relations: The Ambassador characterized our relations as
                            good, at the same time suggesting by waggles of head and hand that they
                            are not entirely problem-free. At this point the President rose to close
                            the interview and, as if reading the Ambassador's mind, he laughingly
                            commented that there is the matter of textiles which, it seems, will
                            always be with us.</p>

                            thinking underlying the proposal of an interest equalization tax.<note n="2" xml:id="d376fn2">President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> had presented this proposal to the Congress
                                on July 18 in a special message to the Congress on the balance of
                                payments. For text, see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the
                                    Presidents of the United States: <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">John F. Kennedy</persName>, 1963</hi>, p. 580. Purpose of
                                the proposed tax was to effect an increase of about 1 percent in the
                                cost to foreigners of capital raised in the United States, and
                                thereby to help bring the U.S. balance of payments into equilibrium
                                without raising domestic interest rates. It was approved on
                                September 2, 1964, as P.L. 88-563; see 78 Stat. 809.</note> He
                            referred to the increase in the outflow of long-term capital at a time
                            when foreign short-term claims against the dollar were also increasing.
                            To meet this situation Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> had pursued the least restrictionist policy,
                            preferring the mechanical method of an interest equalization tax to any
                            form of direct controls. The proposed tax afforded the best method,
                            short of direct controls, of equating U.S. interest rates with the world
                            level while permitting our friends to have continued access to the U.S.
                            capital market with the least harmful effect on their economies. We
                            believed that the tax, the equivalent of a 1 percent increase in U.S.
                            long-term interest rates, would eliminate marginal borrowing,
                            particularly in areas like Europe where interest rates were close to
                            those of the United <pb n="780" xml:id="pg_780" facs="0816"/>States and
                            where capital would be available were the capital markets better
                            organized. The tax would, in effect, spread the burden of providing
                            capital for world-wide economic expansion. The best advice of the New
                            York financial community was that while the tax might reduce access to
                            the U.S. capital market, it would not seriously interfere, for example,
                            with Japan's ability to finance her programs. No long-term restrictive
                            effect was anticipated in view of the difference in Japan's equity and
                            interest rate structure even though the immediate effect would be an
                            increase in interest and equity costs for Japan. The Under Secretary
                            recognized that Japanese financial experts disagreed with these views
                            and suggested that the experts explore the question.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister replied that Japanese financial experts were aware
                            of the American belief that the tax would not interfere with normal
                            Japanese access to the American capital market. He pointed out that
                            investment in Japanese stocks came to an almost complete standstill when
                            the new tax was announced.<note n="3" xml:id="d376fn3">In a telephone

                                asserted that “we” had received a telegram stating that the Bank of
                                Japan did not believe the proposal would really hurt Japan but that
                                it didn't want this statement attributed to it. (Notes of telephone
                                conversation; Kennedy Library, <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> Papers, Japan)</note> Should the tax be
                            imposed, little return could be expected from Japanese bonds; the return
                            was so slight already that hardly any difference existed between
                            American and Japanese bonds.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister stated that Japan had based her economic policies on
                            the premise that the United States was firmly committed to the
                            maintenance of a free dollar and would take no steps to control access
                            to the American capital market. In his view, the new policy would have
                            serious effects in Japan and, unless changed, could have serious
                            political consequences. Japan understood that the new policy had been
                            formulated because of the need to protect the dollar. He hoped that the
                            talks between the experts could be expedited with a view toward
                            reaching, as rapidly as possible, a resolution of differences which
                            would spare Japan from unfavorable consequences of the proposed tax.</p>
                        <p>The Under Secretary assured the Foreign Minister that all concerned
                            desired a solution which met Japan's financial and political problems as
                            well as our own balance of payments problem. We were, however,
                            restricted in our search for an easy solution by the tensions existing
                            in world capital markets; he noted the growing movement against the
                            dollar in the previous week, particularly in Switzerland. This results
                            from the belief in financial circles that the United States must
                            consider political affairs in the world as carefully as the strength of
                            the dollar. Scepticism about American efforts to stem the outflow of
                            capital was a factor which <pb n="781" xml:id="pg_781" facs="0817"/>could not be ignored in seeking a solution which would demonstrate our
                            sympathetic understanding of Japan's situation.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said there had been no change in the Japanese
                            Government's position of cooperating in the defense of the dollar. He
                            understood that the United States Government must be firm in this
                            purpose. He did not intend to advocate a change in this basic policy.
                            However, within the framework of this policy and U.S.-Japan cooperation,
                            he felt that the two countries can, and indeed must, achieve an
                            adjustment of their differences.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TR1">Takeuchi</persName> inquired
                            whether any estimate of Japanese needs to borrow in the American market
                            had been made in the course of the U.S. Government's study of the effect
                            of the tax on Japanese borrowing. The Under Secretary replied that he
                            did not know, adding that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> would discuss this question. The Treasury
                            conducted these studies in which, because of the sensitivity of the
                            matter, the Department of State did not participate until just before
                            the proposal was advanced.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TR1">Takeuchi</persName> asked whether
                            the United States Government had any intention of reducing the amount of
                            money which Japan can borrow in the United States. He said that the
                            dollar had not been endangered by Japanese borrowing in spite of an
                            increase of $100 to $150 million over 1962.</p>
                        <p>The Under Secretary replied that market forces would determine the flow
                            of capital which would continue to go to those countries having the
                            greatest differential in interest rate. If the differential was less
                            than 1 percent, then capital flow would be reduced. The out-flow of
                            long-term capital, he believed, would ultimately be reduced to $400 to
                            $600 million a year, the same result as would be obtained from a 1
                            percent increase in interest rates.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TR1">Takeuchi</persName> said that many
                            Japanese feel that the impact of the proposed tax on Japanese borrowing
                            needs had not been studied carefully. This feeling had been strengthened
                            by the action taken with regard to Canada,<note n="4" xml:id="d376fn4">Concerning the nature of the “exemption” granted Canada, see the
                                joint U.S-Canadian communique, dated July 21, in Department of State
                                    <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, August 12, 1963, p. 256.</note>
                            a country about which the United States should have known more.
                            Apparently something happened to occasion an exemption for Canada. Many
                            Japanese feel that the same situation applies to Japan.</p>
                        <p>The Under Secretary commented that this question should be raised with
                            the Treasury which undertook the studies. The studies themselves were
                            global and not national in nature. European interest rates had been
                            studied and it was felt that the tax would divert borrowing from the
                            American to the European market, provided the 1 percent tax equalized
                            the interest rate differential.</p>
                        <pb n="782" xml:id="pg_782" facs="0818"/>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister observed that his Prime Minister and Government
                            believed that Japan, by leaving her earnings and borrowings in the
                            United States to finance imports from the United States, had not
                            aggravated the outflow of capital. Japan has cooperated with the United
                            States in this matter and was dismayed at this step taken by the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>The Under Secretary said it was his impression that part of Japan's
                            dollar holdings had gone to finance Japan's adverse trade balance with
                            Europe. He felt that the U.S.-Japan trade balance might have reached a
                            state of equilibrium. However, the tax was directed at Europe rather
                            than elsewhere. While there might be some reduction in the flow of
                            American capital to Japan, he felt there would still be a substantial
                            flow, particularly in the form of portfolio investment. There is no
                            desire to impair the development of the Japanese economy. The American
                            interest is in the solution of the political and economic problem, which
                            is difficult to achieve in view of the sensitivity of the world
                            financial markets.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TR1">Takeuchi</persName> asked whether
                            the United States would consider measures which would permit Japanese
                            borrowing if it can be proved in the near future that the tax would
                            prevent Japan from financing her programs, thereby endangering both the
                            programs and the government itself. He said he was not seeking a
                            guarantee but he wondered whether the logic of Japan's position was not
                            evident.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_REO1">Reischauer</persName> commented
                            that this was precisely the question under discussion.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TR1">Takeuchi</persName> asked whether
                            the same result might not be achieved by voluntary controls rather than
                            by a tax. In reply, the Under Secretary said that was a matter to be
                            explored with the Treasury. The problem was extremely sensitive and must
                            be handled without leading to further erosion in the position of the
                            dollar.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_REO1">Reischauer</persName> asked what
                            Japan's capital needs were expected to be. The Foreign Minister replied
                            that the need was great from the standpoint of Japan's balance of
                            payments and economic growth. Japan's current transactions were
                            generally in balance but there was a deficit of about $400 million in
                            invisibles which was covered by capital borrowing. $300 million would be
                            the minimum required for investments which would permit a continuation
                            of Japan's growth rate. When Mr. Kaplan pointed out that the tax would
                            apply to portfolio but not direct investments, the Foreign Minister said
                            that $600 million was the figure for all capital borrowing, including
                            direct investment.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TR1">Takeuchi</persName> wondered
                            whether the new policy was not successful in Europe in view of the
                            absence of any protests against it. The Under Secretary agreed that
                            there did not seem to be so much concern in European nations which could
                            find capital at home and have turned to the United States only out of
                            convenience. Japan and Canada had been the countries of greatest concern
                            to the United States in this matter.</p>
                        <pb n="783" xml:id="pg_783" facs="0819"/>
                        <p>The Under Secretary assured the Foreign Minister of our desire to be
                            helpful, adding that the Treasury should take the lead since it is
                            responsible for the United States balance of payments. Policy would be
                            guided, he cautioned, by the impact of any decision on the financial
                            community.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TR1">Takeuchi</persName> noted that the
                            draft legislation was general in terminology and did not exclude the
                            possibility of an exemption for Japan. Should Administration officials
                            make any statement in their testimony before Congress advocating
                            excluding Japan from exemption, this would have a very adverse effect in
                            Japan leaving no room for improvement of the situation. The Ambassador
                            pointed out that the Japanese stock market had taken a downturn
                            immediately following a press article attributing to a high United
                            States official the view that Japan was not to be exempted from the
                            tax.</p>
                        <p>The Under Secretary concluded the meeting by noting that some
                            possibilities might come to light during subsequent discussions by the
                            experts. These could be reviewed before the Foreign Minister's meeting
                            with the President.<note n="5" xml:id="d376fn5">See <ref target="#d377">Document 377</ref>. <persName corresp="#p_OM1">Ohira</persName>

                        </list>
                        <p>The President said he was pleased to have an opportunity to meet the
                            Foreign Minister again, and expressed regret if any actions taken by the
                            United States caused the Foreign Minister to come to Washington at this
                            time.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister thanked the President for receiving him on such
                            short notice and expressed appreciation for the President's leadership
                            of the Free World.</p>
                        <p>The discussion then turned to the subject of U.S. balance of payments
                            measures. The President began by expressing regret that U.S. actions had
                            created difficulties for Japan and by assuring the Foreign Minister that
                            the United States wishes to lessen the impact of these measures on Japan
                            to the extent possible. We recognize that Japan has not actually
                            contributed to our difficulties and has refrained from taking gold from
                            the United States. If the problem concerned only Japan, Canada and the
                            United States, a solution could easily be reached since the American
                            dollar is almost the common currency of these three countries. However,
                            the problem is common to all of us in the Free World. In taking these
                            measures to defend the integrity of the dollar, the United States feels
                            it is acting in the interests of the entire Free World. The great number
                            of dollars outstanding which can be converted into gold is alarming.
                            This outflow of dollars and consequent claims against the U.S. gold
                            reserve cannot be allowed to continue, the United States having already
                            suffered a gold outflow of $15 billion in the last ten years. The
                            American dollar is the very basis for the entire financial system of the
                            West and the cooperation of all parties is required if the dollar is to
                            continue to serve that function. If the value of the dollar were not
                            maintained, then a new monetary system would have to be invented since
                            there is obviously not enough gold to maintain world trade at its
                            present level. This is an area, however, where nations guard their
                            sovereignty most jealously.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister assured the President that Japan understands the
                            necessity of safeguarding the value of the dollar to maintain the
                            prosperity of the Free World. Japan has cooperated to this end in the
                            past and desires to work even more closely with the United States to
                            help overcome the present difficulties. There will be no change in this
                            basic policy of the Japanese Government. The Foreign Minister expressed
                            confidence that the U.S. balance of payments would be successfully
                            resolved under the fine leadership of the President.</p>
                        <p>The President expressed appreciation for Japan's cooperation in a number
                            of problem areas, such as textiles, which has helped to maintain an even
                            flow of trade.</p>
                        <pb n="785" xml:id="pg_785" facs="0821"/>
                        <p>The President repeated assurances that the United States is anxious to
                            explore means of minimizing the unfavorable impact on Japan of the U.S.
                            balance of payments measures. He noted that the joint communique<note n="1" xml:id="d377fn1">The joint communique has not been found, but
                                a joint communique issued at the conclusion of a meeting of the

                                then be taken to meet the problem, including some form of exemption
                                from the proposed interest equalization tax for new issues of

                        <p>The Foreign Minister handed to the President a letter from Prime Minister

                            already read. The President remarked that he appreciated the Prime
                            Minister's concern over the impact on Japan of U.S. balance of payments
                            measures. We recognize that Japan requires a regular inflow of
                            capital.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister expressed appreciation for U.S. efforts in <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> and for the assistance rendered Japan
                            by the United States with respect to Japan's entry into the <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The President inquired whether reference might be made in the joint
                            communique to matters other than the balance of payments. Under
                            Secretary Ball said it might be useful to mention the importance of the
                            partial test ban treaty and Japan's announced intention to adhere. The
                            Foreign Minister replied that Japan had not considered going so far in
                            the communique. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TR1">Takeuchi</persName> added that inserting an additional paragraph on
                            the treaty in the already long communique would make it unmanageable in
                            length and suggested that consideration be given to a separate
                            communique covering other matters. The President said he would leave it
                            up to the others present to decide.</p>
                        <p>In response to a question by the President, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TR1">Takeuchi</persName> said there had been an overall
                            drop of 10 percent in the Tokyo stock market since the President's
                            speech of July 18. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> compared this to the decline from 734 to 640 in
                            the index of U.S. stock prices in the past year.</p>
                        <p>As the Foreign Minister rose to leave, the President inquired about the
                            reaction of the Japanese Communist Party (<gloss target="#t_JCP1">JCP</gloss>) to the Sino-Soviet split. The Foreign Minister
                            explained that the <gloss target="#t_JCP1">JCP</gloss> is basically
                            sympathetic to Communist China but that there is severe internal strife
                            between pro-Peiping and pro-Moscow factions. The <gloss target="#t_JCP1">JCP</gloss> has about 100,000 members <pb n="786" xml:id="pg_786" facs="0822"/>and polls about 2 percent of the popular vote in
                            Japanese elections. Its real strength, however, is greater than these
                            statistics suggest.</p>
                        <p>The President asked for the Foreign Minister's views on the possible
                            course of Communist China in the near future. The Foreign Minister said
                            he believes Communist China will become more active in promoting its
                            ideological position, particularly in Southeast Asia, but will probably
                            remain cautious about undertaking any actions in Southeast Asia.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_OM1">Ohira</persName> responded that he had
                            come to Washington primarily to discuss the balance of payments question
                            and the equalization tax, but <pb n="787" xml:id="pg_787" facs="0823"/>was grateful for the opportunity to continue discussions begun in
                            meetings in Tokyo last February with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName>. He inquired if the President's message had
                            caused any change in U.S. Department of Defense expenditure
                            policies.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName> replied that when he
                            had talked with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_OM1">Ohira</persName> in Tokyo
                            he had said that the U.S. would not reduce its power base in the Far
                            East and that this intent was as valid now as then. In February the
                            threat of the Chinese Communists was considered a real and present
                            danger and is so regarded now, as President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> had mentioned in his press conference last
                                week.<note n="1" xml:id="d378fn1">For the President's remarks on

                        <p>Adverting again to his February statements about the U.S. power base in
                            the Far East, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName> said
                            that his remarks at the time were not meant to rule out some future
                            readjustment of our force dispositions, so long as our over-all
                            capability was not impaired. He said that several developments have
                            occurred over the past year. For one thing, the U.S. has greatly
                            improved its airlift capability and by 1966 will have a 300% increase
                            over its 1961 airlift strength. Further, the range of our tactical
                            fighters has been increased to the point where rapid deployment over the
                            Atlantic and Pacific is possible. The U.S. now has the capability to
                            deploy a division to Europe or the Far East in days rather than weeks
                            and, by prepositioning the heavy equipment, can have a division combat
                            ready at a distant location much more rapidly than in the past. As a
                            consequence of these developments, and as the President said in his July
                            18th message, the U.S. expects by adjusting force levels in the Far East
                            and elsewhere to save about $300 million a year in defense expenditures
                            overseas.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the proposed adjustments in Japan, the U.S. will, through
                            Ambassador Reischauer and U.S. military personnel, discuss with their
                            Japanese counterparts the specifics involved. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName> said that, although we were
                            not yet ready to discuss details,<note n="2" xml:id="d378fn2">Documentation on U.S. efforts to reach an agreed U.S. Government

                                for 1963.</note> we have in mind such actions as returning some of
                            our transport aircraft, and some of the tactical aircraft, since
                            replacements for these types are capable of long-range deployment. The
                            U.S. also has in mind that some of our squadrons in Japan will be
                            deployed without dependents and that some of our bases there may be put
                            on a “joint-use” status, manned by U.S. and Japanese personnel, rather
                            than in a full operating status. To demonstrate <pb n="788" xml:id="pg_788" facs="0824"/>our capability for rapid deployment of
                            aircraft earmarked for bases in Japan we plan to hold large-scale
                            military exercises, and have in mind one such exercise in the Far East
                            next spring if we can work out the necessary arrangements. For logistic
                            support of Far East forces we would continue to use ships as floating
                            depots, to back up rapid force deployments. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName> emphasized that all these
                            projected actions are part of a world-wide effort to reduce overseas
                            expenditures without affecting combat effectiveness, and that the effort
                            relates particularly to the logistics and support areas. Our Ambassador
                            and military personnel will be working out these moves with Japanese
                            representatives. As the President has said, we do not want to weaken, or
                            to give the appearance of weakening, U.S. strength and resolution to
                            meet the threat in any area.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName> pointed out that the
                            U.S. is aware that the moves he had described are recognized as
                            politically sensitive matters to both countries and that he felt neither
                            the U.S. nor the Japanese side would want to discuss them publicly at
                            this time. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName> added
                            that these moves are but a natural evolution of the U.S. total defense
                            posture, planned when President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> took office and now coming into being.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_OM1">Ohira</persName> replied that he
                            appreciated Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName>'s frank
                            remarks and that he would see that no leaks were made to the press.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_OM1">Ohira</persName> went on to a related
                            question. He said that press reports have said the U.S. is withdrawing a
                            division from Korea, and he wondered if this were part of the U.S.
                            balance of payments actions, or perhaps an erroneous report.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName> replied that the
                            press statements were at least premature. He explained that the U.S. is
                            in a paradoxical situation in Korea. The US/<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces there are more than sufficient for dealing with
                            a North Korean attack but inadequate without reinforcement for
                            containing a North Korean/ChiCom attack. He said that ever since he was
                            Under Secretary of the Air Force ten years ago, the U.S. has had the
                            same force deployed to Korea. Speaking personally, since no decision has
                            yet been made, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName> said
                            he predicted that we would not make any immediate change in Korean
                            forces—the situation is too uncertain—but that in the long run we will
                            be thinking of some readjustment of forces in Korea as our capability to
                            redeploy will permit.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_OM1">Ohira</persName> had a second question. He
                            asked when the US-Japan talks could take place, inasmuch as he could
                            foresee a curtailment on Japanese income from U.S. forces and some
                            effect on Japanese defense budget planning. He said it was necessary to
                            put next year's Japanese defense budget together about November of this
                            year.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName> replied that he
                            could foresee some such effects from the moves of U.S. dependents, but
                            he hoped these would be temporary. He said that after the Ambassador
                            returns at the end of August and <pb n="789" xml:id="pg_789" facs="0825"/>sometime within the next two months or so we should be ready for
                            discussions. On the U.S. military side General Smart, although he has
                            just moved to Hawaii, would take an active interest in talks, as would
                            Admiral Felt. The full implications of the U.S. moves (<gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 64 and later) should be discussed with
                            Japan before the latter had to make budget decisions. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName> went on to say that the U.S.
                            has its budget problems too. Indeed, some of the projected actions will
                            cost the U.S. more in budget dollars, e.g., to fly out aircraft to the
                            Far East, but that this is a way to save gold.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_OM1">Ohira</persName> went to a third point,
                            concerning the Japan Second Defense Five-Year Build-up Plan (1962-1966).
                            This plan, which called for Japanese expenditures of about $3-1/3
                            billion, was drafted with the expectation of receiving about $50 million
                            per year in U.S. grant aid. Of the $250 million anticipated, Japan had
                            received about one fourth. Japan wants to cooperate in the U.S. program
                            to save dollars but is concerned that in the portion of grant aid not
                            yet received is the U.S. portion for <gloss target="#t_BADGE1">BADGE</gloss> (air defense system),<note n="3" xml:id="d378fn3">U.S.-Japanese agreement relating to a joint cost-sharing program
                                for the production of equipment and the provision of technical
                                assistance for the base air defense ground environment (<gloss target="#t_BADGE1">BADGE</gloss>) system was effected by an
                                exchange of notes at Tokyo on December 4, 1946. It entered into
                                force that same day. For text, see 15 <gloss target="#t_UST1">UST</gloss> 2339.</note> and for naval ships and helicopters
                                (<gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss>). Mr. <persName corresp="#p_OM1">Ohira</persName> said he realized what U.S.
                            thinking was from the President's message and from Senator Church's
                            amendment, but he wondered just what to expect from U.S. military
                            assistance.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName> said that our
                            position on military assistance to Japan has not changed from that
                            discussed with Mr. Shiga in Tokyo and that the U.S. still intends to
                            share in the cost of <gloss target="#t_BADGE1">BADGE</gloss>. He said
                            that we have studied the Japanese choice of <persName corresp="#p_HTL1">Hughes</persName> as contractor for <gloss target="#t_BADGE1">BADGE</gloss>, and noted that these projects always cost more than
                            anticipated. As to support for <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss>, we
                            can make no commitment in the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 64
                                <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> until Congress acts on the
                            appropriation (about two months from now). As to the Church amendment,
                            we hope for a Foreign Relations Committee interpretation that will be
                            helpful.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_OM1">Ohira</persName> said he wished to
                            conclude with a reference to the proposed entry into Japanese ports of
                            U.S. nuclear-powered submarines.<note n="4" xml:id="d378fn4">The United
                                States and Japan did not reach agreement on entry of nuclear-powered
                                submarines into Japanese ports until 1964. Documentation in
                                Department of State, Central Files <gloss target="#t_DEF1">DEF</gloss> 7 JAPAN-US and AE 10-2 JAPAN indicates that a
                                stumbling block throughout 1963 was the inability of the United
                                States under existing security regulations to furnish Japan with
                                information that would answer Japan's concerns over safety of the
                                vessels.</note> He said he understood that the U.S. Navy might be
                            impatient, but that it was his idea that it was politically wise to have
                            the Japan <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> make a favorable
                            recommendation to the Japanese Government. For this reason Dr.
                            Kaneshige, <gloss target="#t_JAEC1">JAEC</gloss> Commissioner, was in
                            Washington to discuss technical matters and that he hoped this would be
                            helpful. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_REO1">Reischauer</persName>
                            <pb n="790" xml:id="pg_790" facs="0826"/>said that he and Dr. Kaneshige
                            had met with V/Adm. Rickover earlier that morning for a useful
                            discussion.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_OM1">Ohira</persName>'s final question was to
                            ask if there are any new developments in the Far East.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName> said that President
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> had held a meeting
                            last week to consider the implications of recent international
                            incidents, such as the shootings in Korea, a possible Chinese Communist
                            build-up on the border of India, and the uncertain truce in Laos, and
                            that at the moment the consensus was that, although the situation was
                            threatening, no major moves are foreseen. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName> assured Mr. <persName corresp="#p_OM1">Ohira</persName> that if any such moves are
                            anticipated, the U.S. will consult with Japan.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName> closed by saying
                            that he believes these talks are quite useful and that there should be
                            regular exchanges of views between Defense officials of the two
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>It was agreed that statements to the press regarding Mr. <persName corresp="#p_OM1">Ohira</persName>'s call would be limited to saying
                            that the latter was a follow-up of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName>'s visit to Tokyo in February, 1963.</p>

                            Ryukyus is provided for by Article 3 of the Treaty of Peace with Japan,
                            entered into in 1952, which states that Japan will concur in any
                            proposal of the United States to place the Ryukyu Islands under <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> trusteeship with the US as the sole

                            governmental powers pending such a proposal. The US has not made any

                            Treaty, Japan's interest in the US administration was minimal and
                            Ryukyuan issues had little or no bearing on political developments in
                            Japan. This interest increased markedly, however, in 1955 when Ryukyuan
                            dissatisfaction with US land rental policies assumed serious
                            proportions. Although this dissatisfaction was alleviated by changes in
                            US policies, Japanese interest in the welfare of the Ryukyuans has
                            continued and problems in US administration are frequently used by
                            Japanese leftist elements for their own political ends and for the
                            purpose of arousing sentiment against the continued use of the Islands
                            for US military bases.</p>
                        <p>Responsible <gloss target="#t_LDP1">LDP</gloss> leaders recognize that US
                            bases in Okinawa are vital to defense of Japan and free Asia but at same
                            time they must take into consideration wide feeling among Japanese that
                            the Ryukyus should be returned to Japan in the not too distant future.
                            As result GOJ “in principle” desires return of the Ryukyus. Since the
                            US, for security reasons, cannot comply, it inevitably is placed in a
                            position of public “disagreement” with its Japanese partner even though
                            the present Japanese Government understands and tacitly accepts need for
                            retention of Okinawan bases by US.</p>
                        <p>As nationalism revives in Japan Okinawa can, unless wisely handled,
                            become cause of serious trouble between US and Japan even if Japan
                            continues to have a conservative government.</p>
                        <p>The problem we face is to prevent a situation from arising in which
                                <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> will be under such domestic
                            pressure on the Okinawan issue that in the interest of self-preservation
                            it will feel required to place serious pressure on its US partner to
                            return the Ryukyus. It already faces constant agitation on the issue
                            from the Left. If this should combine with pressure on right from
                            renascent nationalism, the results could be extremely serious.</p>
                        <p>The new policy announced by President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> on March 19, 1962<note n="2" xml:id="d379fn2">See <ref target="#d352fn4">footnote 4, Document 352</ref>.</note>
                            constitutes an effort to meet this challenge. Under it we hope (a) to
                            work out a cooperative relationship which will permit Japan to provide
                            more aid for the Ryukyus and generally work with us in the best
                            interests of the Ryukyuans; and (b) to reduce dissatisfaction in the
                            Ryukyus by providing more economic assistance, by permitting gradually
                            increased autonomy for the <gloss target="#t_GRI1">GRI</gloss> and by
                            eliminating grievances to the extent possible in the field of civil
                            rights. The <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> can thus evidence its
                            concern for <pb n="792" xml:id="pg_792" facs="0828"/>the Ryukyus and
                            increase its role there, and thereby meet the requirements of
                            nationalism and reduce its vulnerability to Leftist pressures without
                            compromising our administrative authority. Moreover, the Ryukyuans can
                            be kept relatively content.</p>
                        <p>For the past year the US and Japanese Governments have been engaged in
                            negotiations, in accordance with the Presidential statement of March 19,
                            1962, to implement a cooperative relationship in providing assistance to
                            promote the welfare of the inhabitants of the Ryukyu Islands and their
                            economic development. The negotiations are directed toward the
                            establishment of a Consultative Committee in Tokyo which will plan and
                            coordinate aid policies and a Technical Committee in Okinawa to
                            implement programs. The Embassy in July, 1963 submitted to the Foreign
                            Office the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> draft of an agreement for
                            the establishment of the two committees. In late September it received
                            the <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> counterdraft which it forwarded
                            to Washington for review. The Embassy is now awaiting Washington advice
                            prior to resuming negotiations with the Foreign Office, and anticipates
                            that a considerable amount of negotiation will be required to arrive at
                            mutual agreement.<note n="3" xml:id="d379fn3">A detailed Embassy

                        <p>Despite general health of economy, with expanding production and exports,
                            climate of Japanese/American economic relations has worsened since last
                            assessment for period ending May 1963. Prevailing tone in press more
                            often bitter than mellow; govt officials more skeptical than receptive
                            to U.S. demarches on economic subjects.</p>
                        <p>Following developments are favorable, however, both to Japan-U.S.
                            relationships and to fortunes of Liberal Democratic Party: (1) Japan's
                            invitation from <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> to full

                            Japanese trade by European countries and Australia, as credit for
                            acceptance of Japan given U.S. to considerable extent; (3) Japan's
                            increasing confidence in her role in Asia, again because encouragement
                            by America has contributed to Japan's confidence to take more
                            initiative; (4) close consultation between two countries on matters
                            affecting restoration of relations with Korea, enabling hopefully Japan
                            to play major role in developing Korea's economy, also drew Japan and
                            America closer together; (5) visits of Ministers <persName corresp="#p_OM1">Ohira</persName> and Tanaka to U.S.</p>
                        <p>Unfavorable developments in our economic relationships however appear to
                            outweigh favorable factors, insofar as Japanese public is concerned, and
                            change in mood for worse is pronounced also in business, finance and
                            government. Unfavorable factors include: (1) proposed interest
                            equalization tax, which came as surprise and shock to Japan, especially
                            when Canada was granted exception. It led to fears that denial of U.S.
                            funds would seriously impede growth of Japan's economy and that tax
                            itself was prelude to still more drastic U.S. action; (2) continued
                            reduction offshore and <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> procurement,

                            flourishing with U.S., and Japanese economy is moving toward new highs.
                            Furthermore, U.S. remains far and away most liked foreign country among
                            Japanese, according to public opinion polls. Long list of contentious
                            points should not obscure reality of fundamentally friendly attitude
                            despite increasing number minor divergencies.</p>
                        <p>[Here follows a section on the current situation of the Japanese economy
                            as it affected the domestic political scene.]</p>
                        <p>E. Problems for Japan's future.</p>
                        <p>Japan's leadership must plan for future that will be heavily depend-ent
                            on overseas sources for raw materials, markets for exports, and capital
                            funds which are essential if Japan is to continue to develop her social
                            and economic structure. Circumstances dictate that Japan's headlong
                            growth rate is bound in long run to slow down, and that more attention
                            must be given to improvements in Japan's infrastructure, roads, schools,
                            water and sewage systems. Diversion of labor, capital and management
                            from expansive industry to these areas will have a dampening effect on
                            economic growth that has made such startling advance in last decade.
                            Japan's need for raw materials appears today to present no special
                            problems, except perhaps in case of sugar; shortage of world supplies
                            and sharp price increases have increased substantially Japan's bill for
                            sugar and future supplies available to Japan cause her great concern.
                            Japan's problems, however, center on need for expanding export markets
                            rather than on intensive search for imports and on her recent dependence
                            on <pb n="795" xml:id="pg_795" facs="0831"/>capital from overseas to
                            finance continued growth which her people have come to demand and to
                            expect. At Joint ECONCOM Embassy would expect Japanese side to stress

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">I. Summary</p>
                        <p>Japan continues on course as political, economic and defense partner of
                            U.S., as increasingly important member free world, as contributor to
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> objectives, and as active member
                            Asian-African bloc where it plays ever more prominent role. Partly
                            because of lingering, pacifistic yearning for neutralism growing out of
                            Japan's experience World War II, recent Limited Nuclear Test Ban
                            Agreement and impression resulting improved east-west atmosphere have
                            paved way for mood of detente in Japan. At same time <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss> have in variety of ways redoubled blandishments to
                                <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss>. Govt meeting situation with
                            eyes open, well aware that eternal vigilance continues be price safety
                            in Communist-threatened world. Fact is, however, detente mood militates
                            against too abrupt assumption higher “posture” by <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> and <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> and precludes, for example, any dramatic defense

                            power in general elections scheduled Nov 21 though probably with
                            slightly diminished support as result of continuation of slow, long-term
                            political trend. Moderately successful <gloss target="#t_LDP1">LDP</gloss> record in election could consolidate Ikeda's position
                            in both Diet and own party and permit if not abandonment of “low
                            posture” approach at least a degree of added initiative in moving Japan
                            toward more responsible role on world scene.</p>
                        <p>Japan's foreign policy reflects definite intention play greater role in
                            field foreign economic assistance particularly Asian <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>'s. US-Japan security arrangements well
                            established. Prevailing harmony affected to some extent dissonance over
                            force readjustment and other relatively minor problems.</p>
                        <p>[Here follow sections on Japan's domestic affairs and external

                        <p> US-Japan relations under 1960 Security Treaty have steadily improved
                            over past two years, characterized by increasingly closer coordination
                            and consultation on security problems between Embassy and FonOff on
                            other. [sic] On Japanese side strong pacifistic, anti-militarist
                            feelings, which have been characteristic of the Japanese people since
                            World War II and are somewhat less intense and over past year there has
                            been distinct trend toward greater Japanese acceptance of realities of
                            world strategic situation. PriMin and FonMin, both in public and private
                            statements, have affirmed principle that Japan must greatly increase its
                            own defense efforts if it is to assume its rightful role as a world
                            power. While defense trend therefore favorable, should be borne in mind
                            that neither Japanese Govt nor public is yet ready to undertake defense
                            program of magnitude which US considers desirable. Present favorable
                            trend in defense field has been accomplished with minimal pressures from
                            US and adherence to our low pressure approach to Japanese continues
                            offer by far safer and better course of action. Japanese will be more
                            inclined accept unpalatable actions in defense area if <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> takes these actions on own steam while
                            we for our part keep them fully informed on our own defense thinking and
                            planning and otherwise treat them as true and equal partners in defense
                            problems of this area.</p>
                        <p>At present time there are four outstanding problems under active
                            discussion and consideration by US and <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> in defense field. These are: (1) US force
                            readjustments; (2) military offset agreements; (3) cut-back and eventual
                            elimination of US military assistance and (4) calls at Japanese ports by
                            US atomic-powered submarines. These four questions are discussed in
                            order below:</p>
                        <pb n="797" xml:id="pg_797" facs="0833"/>
                        <p>(1) Main thrust US force readjustment proposals currently being discussed
                            with Japanese Govt is reduction in US Air Force presence in Japan, both
                            aircraft and civilian personnel. Of paramount concern to Emb is proposal
                            for complete withdrawal by July 1, 1965 of all US fighter interceptor
                            aircraft presently stationed Japan (<gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss>
                            not informed this aspect readjustment). Withdrawal these aircraft (3
                            squadrons F-102s) will leave void in air defense of Japan which Japanese
                            cannot fill from own defense resources by July 1, 1965. Of even greater
                            concern to Emb is fear that withdrawal of all US defensive aircraft will
                            leave US open to charge by opposition elements that US not fulfilling
                            its commitments re defense of Japan under Security Treaty; and instead
                            utilizing Japan only as base for US forward strategic air strike forces.
                            This aspect of problem still under consideration in Washington.</p>
                        <p>(2) As result Deputy Secretary Defense <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName>'s February discussions defense problems with
                            PriMin, in Tokyo, special US-Japan study group has discussed military
                            offset purchase arrangements. Extensive lists of available US military
                            equipment were submitted to <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> for
                            consideration in connection preparation <gloss target="#t_JFY1">JFY</gloss> 64 defense budget. However, while <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> increasing budget by estimated 40
                            billion yen ($112 million), no additional US equipment (beyond some
                            items deleted from <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>) is to be
                            included in <gloss target="#t_JFY1">JFY</gloss> 64 program. Budget
                            increase rather is being [utilized?] by <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> to refurnish and improve existing badly dilapidated
                                <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> defense facilities, to
                            accommodate rising defense costs, including pay increase for self
                            defense forces, and cover cost certain US items originally scheduled be
                            furnished by US under <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>. Hopefully,
                            following elections, <gloss target="#t_JFY1">JFY</gloss> 64 defense
                            budget may be stretched to include purchase small amount additional US
                            equipment. However, Japanese obviously not keen about entering into any
                            large-scale military offset agreement with US. Primary <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> interest lies in building up its own
                            defense production base by producing its own military equipment in
                            Japan. In this context, our best chance for achieving offset arrangement
                            benefiting [garble] appears to lie in negotiating agreements permitting
                            Japanese produce US equipment under licensing arrangements.</p>
                        <p>(3) Military assistance to Japan will apparently be drastically curtailed
                            in US <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 64 and will be terminated in
                            1965 except for continuation certain small training programs. Since
                            second Japanese defense buildup plan (now in its second year) was
                            formulated by <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> on basis approximate
                            $50 million annual <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> contribution from
                            US, curtailment of <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> poses serious
                            problems for Japanese in carrying out second defense plan. This, in
                            combination with proposed US force adjustments, will compel Japanese
                            face up to realities own defense needs much sooner than they originally
                            planned.</p>

                        <p>It is recommended that the Government of Japan be urged to modify its

                            to enable American investors to obtain the national treatment to which
                            they are entitled under Article VII of the FCN Treaty. Specifically, we
                            should request: (a) that American firms making application for
                            investment in an industry in which all investment is restricted by the
                            Japanese Government be treated on the same basis in all respects as a

                            subjected (e.g., limited equity participation and limitations on the
                            number of Americans on the board of directors) be removed.</p>

                        <p>On July 1, 1963, the Government of Japan amended its foreign investment

                            eliminate the right of foreigners to invest in Japan on a non-validated

                            Japan on the same basis as Japanese nationals. This change was

                            were referred to by the Government of Japan as a liberalization. The

                            as joint ventures would be presumed approved in principle and disallowed
                            only in exceptional cases deemed to have “conspicuously adverse effects
                            on the national economy.” Criteria for such a determination were
                            declared to be: extreme disruption of the industrial order; extremely
                            adverse effects on the domestic financial and economic conditions as
                            well as on the balance of payments; and unfair pressure on small or
                            medium enterprises.</p>
                        <p>Despite the emphasis given in the announcement to relaxing the criteria
                            for approval, there has been no indication in the several months since
                            July 1 that the treatment of new foreign investment has been
                            liberalized. Changes in screening procedures have been apparent only for
                            approval of new funds for investments which previous to July 1 did not
                            need validation. As long as American firms could make such “yen-basis”
                            investments, no discrimination in treatment between American and
                            Japanese firms was involved in the Government of Japan's failure to
                            approve a joint venture or to approve the percentage of participation
                            desired by a United States firm. However, since the foreclosing of the
                            option of “yen-basis” investment, the Japanese Government's current
                            investment screening practices appear to constitute discrimination
                            against American firms.</p>
                        <p>Although ostensibly designed to limit calls on foreign exchange reserves,
                            the screening of foreign investment has been administered particularly
                            to limit the extent of foreign control in Japanese enterprises and to
                            prevent upsetting the establishment pattern of competition in an
                            industry.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Office officials, in discussions with the Embassy, have suggested
                            that if American firms bring complaints of discriminatory treatment <pb n="800" xml:id="pg_800" facs="0836"/>of investment applications,
                            such cases should be called to the attention of the Foreign Office. The
                            Embassy has sought to obtain from American business evidence of
                            discrimination on which a protest could be based. However, since
                            American firms operating in Japan are depend-ent in manifold ways on the
                            good will of the bureaucracy, such firms are understandably reluctant to
                            allow their names to be used in a specific protest to the Japanese
                            Government. In the one instance in which an American firm (the American
                            Cyanamid Company) authorized the Embassy to use its name in
                            representations to the Government of Japan, the Foreign Office indicated
                            that the failure to approve the application was not discriminatory since
                            the Japanese Government is restricting all investment whether domestic
                            or foreign, in the particular industry (see Embassy's A-499 of November
                            6, 1963, attached).<note n="3" xml:id="d382fn3">Not printed.</note>

                        <p>A talking paper delivered to the Foreign Office on August 14<note n="4" xml:id="d382fn4">Not found.</note> noted that the abolition of
                            “yen-basis” investment introduced a distinction between the treatment
                            afforded Japanese and American investors and that this difference in
                            treatment appeared to constitute a possible denial to American investors
                            of “national treatment.” It was pointed out to the Foreign Office that
                            whether the loss by American investors of the option to invest on a
                            “yen-basis” resulted in practice in a denial of national treatment would
                            depend on how the new criteria for the approval of foreign investment
                            were applied.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Anticipated Japanese Position:</p>
                        <p>It must be recognized that the Japanese economy has many weak points, and
                            that the Japanese officials believe it is essential for economic growth
                            that foreign capital not be permitted entry on an entirely
                            indiscriminate basis. In spite of this, the Japanese Government has
                            obligated itself to approve foreign investment in all but exceptional
                            cases. Exceptions would involve cases which would have a serious effect
                            on small and medium size industry and where an adverse effect on the
                            existing “industrial order” might be anticipated. Since approval of
                            investments under the new regulations, dated July 1, will be given in
                            all but exceptional cases, Japan will not consider the “yen-basis”
                            option to be necessary.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Ros Gilpatric</persName> reported that Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> and Foreign
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_OM1">Ohira</persName> agreed to a
                            Memorandum prepared by the U.S. side which expressed among other things
                            the hope “that Japan and the U.S. will strive to equalize each other's
                            defense foreign exchange expenditures through reciprocal procurement… or
                            take other actions designed to minimize the balance of payments effects
                            of the U.S./Japan defense partnership” and the following two specific
                            positions:</p>
                        <p>(1) The importance of increasing the Japanese Defense budget; and</p>
                        <p>(2) The desirability of establishing a Defense Study Group, within the
                            framework of the Security Consultative Committee, to pursue our further
                            defense cooperation, including the study of balance of payments effects
                            on our respective foreign exchange expenditures.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName>'s report, which was
                            approved by the President, indicated further that, based on his
                            assessment of Japanese/U.S. relationships, it was his conclusion that
                            the objective of entirely offsetting the present U.S. adverse balance of
                            military expenditures in Japan, running at well over $300 million a
                            year, through the purchase by the Japanese of U.S. military equipment
                            was unlikely of achievement in the near future. In addition to proposed
                            methods of reducing our costs in Japan, the Memorandum concluded that we
                            should revise our military sales goals for offset to $50 million for
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 64, $100 million for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 65 and $150 million for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 66. To date the Defense Study Group
                            meetings have been largely unproductive in achieving any long range
                            agreement on offset in Japan or any basis on which detailed procurement
                            planning could proceed with the Japanese Ministry of Defense. Meetings
                            have been so highly secretive and in such small groups that it has
                            really been impossible to utilize Government channels as a principal
                            means of relating Japanese <pb n="802" xml:id="pg_802" facs="0838"/>military requirement to U.S. export potential. However, there have
                            been sufficient contacts between U.S. and Japanese industry as well as
                            between U.S. and Japanese Armed Forces representatives, with the
                            coordination of the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>, that the
                            offset procurement picture which presents itself to us prior to your
                            meetings in Japan appears as follows:</p>
                        <p>(1) In comparison with the $50 million objective for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 64, the Japanese Government currently
                            estimates that purchases of military equipment from the U.S. will total
                            $64.7 million during <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 64, most of which
                            will be through direct transactions with U.S. defense industry.</p>
                        <p>(2) In comparison with $100 million for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                            65, current Japanese Government estimates and purchases suggest a total
                            of $100 million of which $36 million will be government-to-government
                            transactions and $64 million directly with U.S. defense industry.</p>
                        <p>It would thus appear from an analysis of Japanese sales forecasts that
                            the very modest steps envisaged for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 64
                            and <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 65 towards offsetting procurement
                            have been accomplished and that the principal remaining questions
                            concern:</p>
                        <p>(1) Completion of the third step of <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 66
                            planning for $150 million; and</p>
                        <p>(2) Extension of the scope of the discussions undertaken through the
                            Defense Study Group in such a way as to provide better possibilities for
                            increasing the offset procurement program in the future.</p>
                        <p>We believe that your meetings in Tokyo offer an opportunity to make some
                            progress on these two points. We recommend that you try to reach a
                            bilateral agreement along the lines of the attached draft Memorandum of

                            extent than was possible at that time. Such agreement, taking advantage
                            of the fact that good progress is being made and offering U.S. credit
                            assistance as a means of achieving the $150 million goal for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 66, might now establish a more workable

                                expenditures might affect the negotiating atmosphere because F- 102s
                                were the backbone of the Japanese all-weather interception system.

                        <p>1567. Joint ECONCOM. On Nov 19 senior <gloss target="#t_MITI1">MITI</gloss> officials took initiative with EmbOffs to request that
                            questions relating to liberalization of US investment in Japan not be
                            raised by Cabinet members in joint ECONCOM to the extent of involving
                            the FCN Treaty. <gloss target="#t_MITI1">MITI</gloss> officials said
                            that approach to Emb being made quite independently of FonOff and
                            Ministry of Finance. Confidential and sensitive nature of subject was
                            emphasized. <gloss target="#t_MITI1">MITI</gloss> officials stated that
                            basic policy of <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> with respect to
                            foreign investment is to offer treatment as liberal as possible. To
                            raise the question of the treaty in the Joint Committee could very well,
                            it was asserted, lead to political consequences domestically and to
                            complications in US-Japanese relations. Reference was also made to new
                            legislation governing Japan's trade, invisible, and capital transactions
                            now being drafted by <gloss target="#t_MITI1">MITI</gloss>. This
                            legislation accepts, according to <gloss target="#t_MITI1">MITI</gloss>
                            officials, the principle that all external economic transactions are to
                            be “free.” The proposed law would introduce the so-called “automatic <pb n="804" xml:id="pg_804" facs="0840"/>authorization system” in which
                            an application for investment will be considered approved if a certain
                            period has passed without any decision having been taken. Restrictions
                            would be limited to exceptional cases specified by law.</p>
                        <p>EmbOffs responded that <gloss target="#t_MITI1">MITI</gloss>'s request
                            would be discussed within the Embassy and with Dept, but no hope was
                            held out that <gloss target="#t_MITI1">MITI</gloss>'s suggestion would
                            be accepted.</p>
                        <p>Emb feels that <gloss target="#t_MITI1">MITI</gloss>'s approach, far from
                            suggesting that we should refrain from any initiative, underscores the
                            importance of having the subject (i.e., the problems facing American
                            investors in Japan and their difficulties in obtaining national
                            treatment under the FCN Treaty) raised by U.S. Cabinet officers in the
                            Joint Committee. The Emb has reliable information to the effect that the
                            FonOff and the Ministry of Finance are opposed to the draft legislation
                            proposed by <gloss target="#t_MITI1">MITI</gloss> and instead wish to
                            see a regime which would be more beneficial and attractive to foreign
                            investors (the proposed legislation will not, insofar as the Emb has
                            been able to ascertain, be a liberalization helpful to U.S. business).
                            Moreover the fact that <gloss target="#t_MITI1">MITI</gloss> officials
                            raised this subject with the Emb without the knowledge of other govt
                            ministries (<gloss target="#t_MITI1">MITI</gloss> officials insisted on
                            a discreet meeting with EmbOffs in a private club) indicates that <gloss target="#t_MITI1">MITI</gloss> is in a very weak position on this
                            subject within the <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss>. The difficulties
                            which American business has encountered with respect to investment in
                            Japan may to a great extent be laid at the door of the bureaucrats in
                                <gloss target="#t_MITI1">MITI</gloss>. If we wish to achieve any
                            progress in this field, either on behalf of American business or in the
                            interests of a further opening up and a liberalizing of Japanese
                            economy, action on our part at the highest levels is required. In
                            economic terms further liberalization of foreign investment in Japan
                            would benefit the Japanese economy by serving to break down emerging old
                            and traditional oligopolistic forms and draw the Japanese business
                            community closer to its Western counterparts. Emb believes that
                            suggestions by the Japanese (essentially <gloss target="#t_MITI1">MITI</gloss> officials on this and previous occasions) that
                            pressure on this subject from the U.S. side would force Japan into the
                            position of being obliged to request a revision of the FCN Treaty should
                            be taken with a grain of salt. Such action on the part of Japan would
                            have such far-reaching consequences for the U.S.-Japanese partnership
                            that it is doubtful the step would be taken only on the issue of the
                            terms of U.S. investment.</p>
                        <p>Emb accordingly urges that the entire subject in terms of the FCN Treaty
                            be raised by the U.S. side (in line with existing briefing papers) in
                            Joint ECONCOM.<note n="1" xml:id="d384fn1">See <ref target="#d385">Document 385</ref>.</note> Significantly, senior FonOff

                            Japan and went on to ask if the Prime Minister could give him a secret
                            formula for electoral success. The President said he would be able to
                            use such a formula in next year's elections. The Prime Minister
                            responded that he believes his party's success owes to a tip he received
                            from President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> during the
                            Prime Minister's visit to the United States two and a half years ago.
                            President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> at that time
                            had emphasized the great assistance he received from Mrs.
                                <persName>Johnson</persName> in political campaigns, that in fact
                            most American politicians received invaluable help from their wives.
                            Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> said he went
                            home and immediately put his own wife to work and instructed his cabinet
                            officers to do the same. The recent election victory reflected the
                            valuable help of these wives.</p>

                                assassination in Dallas, Texas, on November 22. Documentation in

                                for 1963 indicates that the White House considered several proposals
                                for a Presidential visit to Japan in the months prior to the
                                President's death. On November 19 <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> discussed with <persName corresp="#p_HRJ1">Hilsman</persName> and Howard Jones, Ambassador to Indonesia, a
                                possible visit in April or May 1964 to several Asian countries
                                including Japan, of which the centerpiece was to be a trip to
                                Indonesia, should the United States succeed in efforts to improve

                            more than ever. He assured Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> that it is the intent of the United States to
                            arrange for the mission to return to Japan, possibly early next year,
                            and when the mission does go we hope Japan will remember our
                            problem.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> expressed
                            sympathy for and understanding of the reasons for the postponement. He
                            said Japan wishes to continue in its relationship with the United States
                            as before, emphasized complete cooperation in United States-Japan
                            relations, in both economics and diplomacy.</p>

                            and said that despite this tragedy the bonds of friendship between Japan
                            and the United States will not be weakened, but rather will be
                            strengthened. He then spoke of the United States hope that relations
                            between Japan and the Republic of Korea can be normalized as soon as

                            said he feels that it is doubtful that under the present circumstances
                            the party of Acting President Park of the Republic of Korea can win a
                            majority of the seats of the National Assembly in this week's general
                            election in Korea. He points out, however, that if Park worked out a
                            coalition of conservative and moderate elements more or less aligned
                            with his objectives he would have a workable majority in the National
                            Assembly and have a good chance to stabilize the situation in the
                            Republic of Korea. Japan would hope that Park will seek this course of
                            action following the elections. The Prime Minister said that if Park is
                            able to stabilize the political situation along these lines, Japan would
                            hope to move toward complete normalization of relations as quickly as
                            possible.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> went on to
                            remark that the Republic of Korea is a nation of 25 million
                            well-educated and hardworking people. A healthy development of the
                            Republic of Korea is, in the Prime Minister's opinion, essential for the
                            security of Japan. Japan and the Free World cannot afford to sit back
                            and allow the Republic of Korea to degenerate into Communism. Therefore,
                            Japan believes it must do everything possible to achieve normalization
                            of relations with the Republic of Korea.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> said that since
                            World War II the United States has spent over $100 billion dollars to
                            help other nations to stand on their own <pb n="807" xml:id="pg_807" facs="0843"/>feet and regain their productivity. Now, however, the
                            Administration is facing increasing problems in Congress, not because of
                            any lack of prosperity in the United States, but because Congressmen
                            feel strongly that others must now assume a larger share of the burden
                            than they have. Congress has made severe and radical reductions in the
                            appropriations for overseas aid programs. We therefore look forward
                            especially to a fruitful exchange between our Cabinet officers and the
                            Ministers of Japan, for Japan is one of the major industrial nations of
                            the world. We hope that we can work together to influence and to assist
                            the less fortunate nations in the world.</p>
                        <p>The President said the fate of the aid bill in Congress represents a very
                            serious problem. He said the Administration wants to tell Congress that
                            the United States will have the help of other nations in carrying the
                            load of overseas assistance programs, in the hope that Congress will
                            provide a stronger aid bill than it so far has appeared willing. The
                            President told Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> that we hope we can receive help from Japan in
                            this problem.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> responded that
                            the general direction of United States policy in this field (i.e.
                            reducing its share of the worldwide burden) appears to him unavoidable.
                            For this reason Japan both understood and acceded readily in the severe
                            reduction in Military Assistance Program expenditures in Japan. The
                            Prime Minister expressed the belief that rather than large-scale dollar
                            aid, we should concentrate together on broader economic assistance to
                            underdeveloped areas such as Southeast Asia. He said he agrees with
                            present United States policy trends.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> noted to the
                            President that Japan under Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> has made remarkable progress in claiming its
                            rightful place among nations, particularly in such areas as the United
                            Nations, the <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> community, and
                            Southeast Asia. He said the United States values its close partnership
                            with Japan because Japan has great power and can make a great
                            contribution in these areas.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> said he
                            personally believed much of this success owes to the help of the United
                            States. He said the direction of emphasis of Japanese policy originated
                            in the urging of former President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> on the occasion of the Prime Minister's visit to
                            Washington two and a half years ago. When Japan first surveyed its
                            chances of admission into the <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> it
                            looked like an impossible challenge. Great Britain in particular
                            appeared to Japan to pose considerable resistance to the entry of Japan
                            into the community. Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> visited England, France, Germany and Benelux last
                            year, however, and as he held talks in the various capitals he sensed an
                            improved climate, which he credited to the help of the United States,
                            which obviously paved the way for achievement of greater success than
                            Japan had hoped for. He again termed Japan's progress in Europe a result
                            of work of the United States.</p>
                        <pb n="808" xml:id="pg_808" facs="0844"/>
                        <p>The Prime Minister went on to state he firmly believes that the frankest
                            United States-Japan consultation is essential, particularly concerning
                            Southeast Asia,<note n="4" xml:id="d385fn4">On November 26 <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> discussed with Ikeda a possible
                                Japanese role in easing the confrontation between Indonesia and
                                Malaysia. (Memorandum by Ainsworth; ibid., Secretary's Memoranda of
                                Conversation: Lot 65 D 330)</note> where there are problems in Burma
                            and Malaysia and elsewhere requiring such close collaboration. He felt
                            such close consultation is the best form of diplomacy in United
                            States-Japan relations.</p>
                        <p>The President said it was impossible to hold detailed talks at this time,
                            but the United States intends to follow just that kind of policy in the
                            future. He said we hope for close consultations, frank and above-board,
                            recognizing our great mutuality of interests.</p>
                        <p>In closing the meeting, Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> expressed the sincere honor he felt at being
                            received by the President when President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> is so tired and pressed for time. The Prime
                            Minister said that as a politician and statesman he had learned a great
                            deal through his participation in the ceremonies surrounding President
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>'s funeral. He said he
                            had learned more of the political attitude of President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>. He said he intended to take
                            these thoughts home with him, to review his own outlook and performance,
                            and to try to apply the <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>
                            spirit in a renewal of relations between Japan and the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> thanked the
                            Prime Minister for meeting with him and assured him of the continued
                            friendship and cooperation of the United States.</p>
