                <p>The Department of State released today <ref target="frus1964-68v20">Foreign
                        Relations of the United States, 1964-1968, Volume XX</ref>, Arab-Israeli
                    Dispute, 1967-1968. This volume, part of the ongoing official record of American
                    foreign policy, presents the record of the <persName>Johnson</persName>
                    administration's efforts to cope with the aftermath of the June 1967 War. The
                    volume's account of developments opens in the wake of the adoption on November
                    22, 1967, of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Security Council Resolution 242,
                    which sought to establish a framework for settlement of the Arab-Israeli
                    dispute. U.S. policy objectives at that point were to participate in efforts to
                    salvage an enduring peace out of the war while limiting the flow of arms to the
                    area and discouraging Israel from adding the dangerous element of nuclear arms
                    into the mix. The documentation published in the volume illustrates that by the
                    time that President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon Johnson</persName>
                    briefed his successor on foreign policy developments in November 1968, the
                    record of U.S. policy in the Middle East following the 1967 war consisted of a
                    series of unrealized objectives, which left the new administration with daunting
                    prospects.</p>
                <p>The United Nations mediation effort launched in November 1967 with strong U.S.
                    support continued throughout the waning months of the
                        <persName>Johnson</persName> administration but accomplished very little,
                    despite the sustained efforts of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Special
                    Representative <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Gunnar Jarring</persName>. The
                        <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> mission served to confirm that
                    the June War had intensified mutual suspicion between Israel and its Arab
                    neighbors. As prospects for the overall peace settlement promoted by the
                        <persName>Jarring</persName> mission dimmed, U.S. officials sought to foster
                    an agreement between Israel and Jordan. A series of secret exchanges between
                    senior Israeli and Jordanian officials proved to be equally inconclusive.</p>
                <p>While the <persName>Johnson</persName> administration was attempting to promote a
                    peace settlement, it was also trying to reduce tensions in the area, which it
                    saw as leading to an arms race. At the end of 1967 the United States was
                    attempting to hold the line against a fresh infusion of weapons into the area.
                    The Soviet Union, meanwhile, was pouring a steady stream of weapons into the
                    region to offset Arab losses during the war. The Israeli Government worried that
                    the end result of the Israeli victory might be Arab military superiority unless
                    the United States increased the flow of weapons to Israel. Jordan, the lone Arab
                    combatant that looked to the West for military supplies, also pressed the United
                    States to offset its heavy losses. To shore up Israeli security, and to prevent
                    Soviet influence from supplanting that of the United States in Amman, the
                        <persName>Johnson</persName> administration agreed during 1968 to new
                    weapons programs for Israel and Jordan, including the introduction of a major
                    new weapon into the area — the F-4 Phantom fighter-bomber — which President
                        <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> ultimately decided to sell to
                    Israel. The volume documents the tense negotiations over the sale of the
                    Phantoms, during which U.S. officials sought to tie the sale to Israeli
                    agreement to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Israel rejected the
                    effort as an infringement of its sovereignty and viewed its potential for
                    nuclear capability as a brake on Arab aggression, which should not be discarded
                    lightly.</p>
                <p>Like most other Arab states, the United Arab Republic broke relations with the
                    United States during the 1967 war on the specious grounds that U.S. military
                    forces had been actively involved on Israel's side during the fighting. There is
                    documentation in the volume on the U.S. response to hints from President
                        <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Gamal Adbel Nasser</persName> that he would have
                    liked to reestablish relations as a counterbalance to Soviet influence in Cairo.
                    The United States and the United Arab Republic differed, however, on what would
                    make a rapprochement possible, and relations remained broken. U.S. influence in
                    the Arab world waned as the Arab states perceived the United States as Israel's
                    major supporter. The decline in U.S. influence in Arab capitals reduced the
                    prospects for promoting a peace settlement in the Middle East. Those prospects
                    were grim at the end of 1968, as terrorists tested Israeli resolve, and Israel
                    and the United Arab Republic engaged in what became a war of attrition.</p>

                <p>(This is not an official statement of policy by the Department of State; it is
                    intended only as a guide to the contents of this volume.)</p>
                <p>Since 1861, the Department of State's documentary series Foreign Relations of the
                    United States has constituted the official record of the foreign policy and
                    diplomacy of the United States. Historians in the Office of the Historian
                    collect, arrange, and annotate the principal documents that make up the record
                    of American foreign policy. The standards for the preparation of the series and
                    the general deadlines for its publication are established by the Foreign
                    Relations of the United States statute of October 28, 1991 (22 USC 4351, et
                    seq.). Volumes in the Foreign Relations series are published when all the
                    necessary editing, declassification, and printing steps have been completed.</p>
                <p>The documents in this volume are drawn from the centralized indexed files of the
                    Department of State and the decentralized Bureau, Office, and other lot files of
                    the relevant Departmental units. The editors also make extensive use of
                    Presidential and other papers at the <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B.
                        Johnson</persName> Library in Austin, Texas, as well as recordings of
                    President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s telephone
                    conversations. In addition, the volume includes records of the Central
                    Intelligence Agency.</p>
                <p>Almost all of the documents printed here were originally classified. The
                    Information Response Branch of the Office of IRM Programs and Services, Bureau
                    of Administration, Department of State, in concert with the appropriate offices
                    in other agencies or governments, carried out the declassification of the
                    selected documents.</p>
                <p>This volume is one of three Foreign Relations volumes on the Arab-Israeli dispute
                    during the <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon Johnson</persName> administration;

                </p>
                <p>Problems in the Middle East intruded upon President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1"
                        >Lyndon Johnson</persName>'s heavy preoccupation with the war in Vietnam
                    during the final years of his administration. While the
                        <persName>Johnson</persName> administration struggled to find a solution in
                    Vietnam, it was compelled to try to deal with the aftermath of the war that had
                    broken out in the Middle East in June 1967. The search for peace in the Middle
                    East proved to be as elusive as the quest for peace in Southeast Asia.</p>
                <p>U.S. policy objectives in the Middle East were to participate in efforts to
                    salvage an enduring peace from the war, limit the flow of arms to the area, and
                    discourage Israel from adding the significant new element of nuclear arms into
                    the mix. By the time President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>
                    briefed his successor on foreign policy developments in November 1968 (315), the
                    record of U.S. policy in the Middle East following the 1967 war consisted of a
                    series of unrealized objectives, which left the new administration with
                    discouraging prospects.</p>
                <p>The United Nations mediation effort launched in November 1967 with strong U.S.
                    support had achieved nothing, despite the sustained efforts of <gloss
                        target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Special Representative <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                        >Gunnar Jarring</persName>. Behind the scenes negotiations between Israel
                    and Jordan, also fostered by the United States, had proven sterile. The U.S.
                    determination to sharply limit the flow of U.S. weapons to potential combatants
                    had crumbled. Israel and Jordan rearmed their forces with U.S. weaponry, as the
                    United States emerged as the primary source of military supplies for Israel.
                    U.S. influence in the area waned as the Arab states linked it to Israel. The
                    Soviet Union took advantage of the situation to champion the Arab cause. The
                    threat of renewed warfare hung over the area as terrorists tested Israeli
                    resolve, and Israel and the United Arab Republic engaged in what became a war of
                    attrition. Despite an international effort to foster the cause of peace, the
                    Middle East was unsettled and dangerous as <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon
                        Johnson</persName> prepared to hand over the reins of power to
                        <persName>Richard Nixon</persName> at the end of 1968.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>The effort to build an enduring peace settlement after the June 1967 war was
                    launched with guarded optimism on November 22, 1967, when the <gloss
                        target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Security Council adopted Resolution 242. Intense
                    diplomatic efforts had produced Resolution 242, which was accepted by all of the
                    combatants except Syria as a framework for a settlement to the Arab-Israeli
                    dispute. It called for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Arab territories
                    occupied during the June war in return for an end to belligerency and
                    acknowledgment of Israel's sovereignty. The resolution also provided for a
                    special representative to be appointed to facilitate negotiations on a peace
                    settlement. On November 23 <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Secretary-General U
                    Thant appointed <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Gunnar Jarring</persName>, the
                    Swedish Ambassador to the Soviet Union, as the Special Representative, and
                        <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> set about the task of
                    searching for sufficient common ground on which to build an enduring peace. His
                    efforts served to highlight the mutual suspicion and animosity that would have
                    to be bridged before peace could be established in the Middle East.
                    (Documentation on the background of Resolution 242 is scheduled for publication
                    in <ref target="frus1964-68v19">
                        <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1964-1968, Volume XIX</ref>.)</p>
                <p>The <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> mission stumbled immediately
                    over varying interpretations of Resolution 242. The Arab governments viewed the
                    resolution as self-implementing, and called upon Israel to withdraw from all
                    conquered Arab territory as a preliminary to a general understanding to
                    establish peace. (87, 113) The Arabs were not, however, prepared for direct
                    negotiations with Israel. In August 1967 the defeated Arab states had met in
                    Khartoum to coordinate strategy. They adopted a joint policy of “no peace with
                    Israel, no recognition of it, and no negotiation with it.” The three “no's" of
                    the Khartoum summit effectively established the parameters of the Arab
                    bargaining position with respect to a settlement with Israel and reinforced
                    Israeli skepticism that the Arabs would be prepared to consider a peace
                    settlement that Israel could accept.</p>
                <p>Despite skepticism about Arab intentions, Israel looked upon the outcome of the
                    war as offering the first good opportunity for peace. The Israeli Government was
                    prepared to trade at least most occupied Arab territory for peace, but there
                    were limits on what it was prepared to negotiate with the Arabs. Israel did not
                    want to try to absorb a large hostile Arab population, but insisted upon some
                    restructuring of the pre-war borders in the interest of security. (39, 103) The
                    strategic Golan Heights captured from Syria was one area that the Israelis felt
                    should be incorporated into Israel in the interest of security. On most issues,
                    the Israelis were prepared to negotiate, but, unlike the Arabs, they envisioned
                    direct negotiations leading to bilateral peace treaties. The only issue the
                    Israelis did not view as open to compromise was the city of Jerusalem. They were
                    not prepared to consider any proposal that called for a reversion of east
                    Jerusalem to Arab control. (88, 97) The Arabs, for whom Jerusalem was also a
                    sacred city, were equally adamant that restoration of Arab control over east
                    Jerusalem had to form a part of any settlement. (67) The Jerusalem issue was one
                    measure of how difficult it would be to promote an agreed settlement between
                    Israel and its Arab neighbors.</p>
                <p>The <persName>Johnson</persName> administration, fully aware of the animosities
                    and rigid views that defined the realm of the possible in the search for a peace
                    settlement, did what it could to promote flexibility and compromise. (41, 90)
                    Administration policy was to support the <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                        >Jarring</persName> mission, however dim its prospects for success. All
                    diplomatic posts in the area were instructed to facilitate <persName
                        corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>'s efforts (10), and the State Department
                    sent a steady stream of appeals to Israel and the Arab capitals urging
                    cooperation with <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>. (63, 79, 102,
                    103, 178) On February 13, 1968, Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RD1"
                        >Dean Rusk</persName> sent a message to Israeli Foreign Minister <persName
                        corresp="#p_EA1">Abba Eban</persName> calling upon Israel to endorse openly
                    Resolution 242, and on May 13 President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1"
                        >Johnson</persName> sent a letter to United Arab Republic (<gloss

                    (79, 171) These and other high-level initiatives, which increased in urgency as
                    policymakers in Washington became concerned that the <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                        >Jarring</persName> mission might collapse, did not seem to change unbending
                    attitudes in the Middle East.</p>
                <p>When Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Levi Eshkol</persName> visited
                    President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> at the
                        <persName>Johnson</persName> Ranch in Texas January 7-8, 1968,
                        <persName>Johnson</persName> attempted in vain to persuade
                        <persName>Eshkol</persName> that Israel was operating from a position of
                    strength in dealing with the Arabs and could afford to be flexible and
                    magnanimous. <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName> saw a ring of hostile
                    enemies surrounding Israel, dedicated to its destruction, and felt he could only
                    rely upon superior military strength and explicit bilateral treaty arrangements
                    with the Arab states to underwrite Israel's security. (39-41) In July President
                        <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> sent <persName
                        corresp="#p_BGW1">George Ball</persName>, who had recently been appointed as

                        >Sisco</persName> visited Jerusalem, Amman, Beirut, and Jidda, and tried,
                    unsuccessfully, to arrange a meeting in Beirut with <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                        >UAR</gloss> Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_RM1">Mahmoud

                        corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> stressed the importance of the <persName
                        corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> mission, and argued that reasonableness
                    and a will to achieve peace could yield a settlement. <persName
                        corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> urged the Israeli Government to make a
                    public statement indicating that it was not interested in acquiring Arab
                    territory, and warned of the danger that Israel would become isolated if it was
                    viewed by world opinion as expansionist and aggressive. (213, 214) <persName
                        corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> also urged the Arabs to be flexible in
                    responding to <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>'s efforts. (218-220)
                        <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> told the Israelis that their
                    insistence upon direct negotiations was self-defeating, and he told King
                        <persName>Hussein</persName> of Jordan that no secure peace could be
                    arranged unless the Arab states were prepared at some point for direct
                    negotiations leading to contractual arrangements. (218) The <persName

                        >Sisco</persName> mission, like other U.S. efforts to promote compromise and
                    support <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>, accomplished little, and
                    by mid-1968 the <persName>Johnson</persName> administration was looking for more
                    promising avenues to peace.</p>

                </p>
                <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> was the leader of popular
                    Arab opinion, and the United Arab Republic was Israel's most formidable
                    opponent. The surest road to peace would have been an understanding between
                    Israel and the United Arab Republic. There was little evidence, however, that
                        <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> was interested in peace except
                    on his own terms, and, even assuming that he was interested in a settlement with
                    Israel, his position was sufficiently weakened by the outcome of the war that
                    domestic opinion further circumscribed what he could do. The Israelis concluded
                    that there was little prospect of a reasonable settlement with
                        <persName>Nasser</persName>. (256) U.S. officials were not sanguine about
                    promoting an understanding between Israel and the United Arab Republic, but they
                    saw some possibility for increased influence in Cairo in the feelers that
                        <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> put out concerning the
                    restoration of relations between the United States and the United Arab
                    Republic.</p>
                <p>Like other Arab states, the United Arab Republic had broken relations with the
                    United States during the 1967 war. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
                    had publicly accused the United States of participating in Israel's air attack
                    upon Egypt on June 5. Nasser remained deeply suspicious of U.S. objectives in
                    the Middle East after the war, and viewed the United States as firmly linked to
                    Israel. By December 1967, however, <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
                    was apparently becoming concerned about the Soviet embrace. He had welcomed the
                    offer from the Soviet Union to replace his country's heavy losses of military
                    equipment during the war, but along with the Soviet weapons had come Soviet
                    advisers and Soviet requests for military facilities in Egypt. In December 1967
                    Nasser hinted that he would like to reestablish relations with the United States
                    as a counterbalance to Soviet influence in Cairo. Using a variety of unofficial
                    intermediaries, such as New York lawyer <persName>James Birdsall</persName> and
                    former World Bank President <persName corresp="#p_BER1">Eugene Black</persName>,
                        <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> repeatedly sent the message to
                    Washington that he would favor the restoration of relations. (12-14, 21, 74)
                        <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> wanted the United States to
                    make it easier for him to justify restored relations by some gesture that could
                    be viewed as pro-Arab, such as a statement calling upon Israel to withdraw from
                    all occupied Arab territory. (34, 161, 343) The <persName>Johnson</persName>
                    administration, however, felt that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
                    would have to set the record straight about what it considered as the “big lie"
                    concerning U.S. involvement in the June war before relations could be restored.
                    (31, 34) <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> addressed the issue
                    somewhat equivocally in an article published in Look magazine on March 19, but
                    neither the United States nor the United Arab Republic met each other's
                    requirements sufficiently to smooth the way to the restoration of relations.</p>
                <p>A much more promising opening for a settlement between Israel and one of its Arab
                    opponents developed through secret conversations between senior Israeli and
                    Jordanian officials. There was a brief attempt at such talks following the 1967
                    war, but it was short-lived. On March 12, 1968, Ambassador <persName
                        corresp="#p_SHM1">Harrison Symmes</persName> cabled from Amman his judgment
                    that the <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> mission was making little
                    progress in promoting a settlement. He recommended that the United States
                    stimulate a return to direct negotiations between Israel and Jordan. (109)
                    Israel had a strong interest in such talks, but for King
                        <persName>Hussein</persName> there were risks involved in seeking an
                    accommodation with Israel. The murder in 1953 of <persName>Hussein</persName>'s
                    grandfather King <persName>Abdullah</persName> was a graphic example of the
                    risks involved. <persName>Hussein</persName>, however, was confronted with the
                    Israeli occupation of half his country, and he opened secret conversations with
                    the Israelis in London in May. (187) President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1"
                        >Johnson</persName>'s Special Assistant, <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt
                        Rostow</persName>, described these talks on September 30 as “the best hope"
                    for peace. (267) Exchanges between senior Israeli and Jordanian officials
                    continued into November, and the Israelis reached the point of making a proposal
                    for an agreement based upon a territorial settlement on the West Bank. The
                    Israeli proposal adhered generally to a plan developed by Israeli Deputy Prime
                    Minister <persName corresp="#p_AY1">Yigal Allon</persName>, which posited
                    Israeli military control over the West Bank, while returning political control
                    of some two-thirds of a demilitarized West Bank to Jordan. From this seemingly
                    promising point in the talks, King <persName>Hussein</persName> grew
                    increasingly skeptical that Israel would offer peace terms that he could accept,
                    and he eventually broke off the talks. (186) At year's end,
                        <persName>Hussein</persName> indicated that the negotiating channel was
                    still open, but that he saw little hope of progress unless the Israelis became
                    more forthcoming in what they were prepared to offer. (373)</p>

                    <hi rend="strong">Concern To Prevent an Arms Race</hi>
                </p>
                <p>While the <persName>Johnson</persName> administration was attempting to promote a
                    peace settlement, it was also trying in other ways to reduce tensions in the
                    area, which were resulting in an arms race. The United States had cut off the
                    flow of U.S. arms to the Middle East during the 1967 war, but despite its
                    postwar decision to honor a 1966 contract with Israel for 48 A-4 Skyhawk
                    fighters, the United States at the end of 1967 was desirous of preventing a
                    fresh infusion of weapons into the area. The Soviet Union, meanwhile, was
                    pouring a steady stream of Soviet weapons into the region to offset Arab losses
                    during the war. The Israeli Government worried that the end result of the
                    Israeli victory might be Arab military preponderance unless the United States
                    increased the flow of weapons to Israel. Jordan made an even more pressing
                    request for the resumption of U.S. military supplies at the end of 1967.</p>
                <p>Jordan had suffered heavy losses during the fighting with Israel. Jordan's
                    traditional sources of military supplies had been from the West, primarily the
                    United States and the United Kingdom. With the U.S. embargo still in effect at
                    the end of 1967, King <persName>Hussein</persName> found himself under heavy
                    domestic pressure to make good the losses in weaponry suffered during the war.
                    Jordan's army faced Israel's across the longest line of confrontation engendered
                    by the Arab-Israeli dispute, and the army became increasingly restive as it
                    tried to meet its responsibilities without the necessary weapons. The Soviet
                    Union offered to meet all of Jordan's military needs on generous terms, and in
                    December proposed to send a high-level military mission to Amman to assess
                    Jordan's needs. (9) On December 30, 1967, King <persName>Hussein</persName> sent
                    an oral message to President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>
                    stating that while he remained a friend of the West and had no desire to buy
                    arms from the Soviet Union, he had to have a commitment that the United States
                    would meet Jordan's military requirements. (29) Confronted with the prospect of
                    Soviet influence replacing that of the United States and Britain in Amman,
                        <persName>Johnson</persName> made a decision in principle to resume arms
                    shipments to Jordan. (37) Jordan's Army Chief of Staff General <persName

                    with a list of Jordan's requirements. (71) After 2 months of sometimes tense
                    negotiations, the United States and Jordan signed a memorandum of understanding
                    on March 28 confirming the arms sale. The most significant elements in the
                    package were 18 F-104 fighters and 100 M 48 tanks. (72, 76, 77, 82, 89, 95, 99,
                    107, 111, 125)</p>
                <p>Israel's objective in pressing its requests for military supplies from the United
                    States was to maintain its military superiority over the combined Arab forces.
                    The <persName>Eshkol</persName> government viewed that superiority as the only
                    guarantee of Israel's security. For Israel the key element in the military
                    equation in the Middle East was control of the skies. The dominance of the
                    Israeli air force during the 1967 war had been a decisive factor, and the
                        <persName>Eshkol</persName> government pressed the
                        <persName>Johnson</persName> administration for the planes necessary to
                    maintain that dominance, particularly the F-4 Phantom fighter-bomber. The
                    Phantom was a superior weapon, which, it was believed, could ensure Israeli
                    security against any aircraft the Soviet Union could provide to the Arab states.
                    The <persName>Johnson</persName> administration was reluctant to introduce this
                    new weapon into the Middle East. To do so would not only confirm Israel's
                    military superiority, but it would also be perceived by the Arabs as proof that
                    the United States had cast its lot firmly with Israel.</p>
                <p>Israel had a prewar contract pending with France at the end of 1967 for 50 Mirage
                    fighters. The United States urged Israel to continue to look to France for arms,
                    but French President <persName>Charles de Gaulle</persName> withdrew the offer
                    to supply Mirages. U.S. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BW1">Walworth
                        Barbour</persName> attempted to persuade Prime Minister <persName
                        corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName> that the additional 48 Skyhawk fighters
                    would be sufficient to provide for Israel's security, but <persName
                        corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName> responded that even with the additional
                    Skyhawks Israel would be at a heavy numerical disadvantage against the <gloss
                        target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss> fighters the Soviet Union was providing to Arab
                    air forces. (3) He insisted that Israel had to have Phantoms. In January 1968
                        <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName> put Israel's case for 50
                    Phantom fighters to President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> in
                    person at the <persName>Johnson</persName> Ranch. (39-41) Secretary of State
                        <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Dean Rusk</persName>, Secretary of Defense
                        <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">Robert McNamara</persName>, and the President's
                    Special Assistant, <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt Rostow</persName>,
                    recommended against supplying the Phantoms to Israel, at least until the outcome
                    of the <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> initiative was clear. They
                    noted the U.S. military assessment that Israel was sufficiently well armed to
                    remain secure in the Middle East for at least 18 months, and they argued that
                    the United States should avoid being cast in the role of principal arms supplier
                    to any country in the area. (36) <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName>
                    took the position that Israel's air force was dangerously depleted by the war,
                    and that the remaining planes were no match for the Soviet <gloss
                        target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>s being supplied to the Arabs. He represented
                    the Arab threat as imminent and argued that only Phantoms could meet that
                    threat. President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> said that he
                    was a proven friend of Israel, but added that he did not believe that weapons
                    made for peace. Nonetheless, he agreed to sell 27 Skyhawks to Israel, beyond the
                    48 contracted for, and promised to make a decision about the Phantoms by the end
                    of the year. (41)</p>
                <p>Israeli officials raised the Phantom issue with increasing urgency during the
                    last months of the <persName>Johnson</persName> administration. (150, 152, 157,
                    247) The issue came to a head in the heat of the U.S. presidential campaign in
                    the fall. The nominees of the two major parties, <persName>Hubert
                        Humphrey</persName> and <persName>Richard Nixon</persName>, publicly
                    endorsed the sale of Phantoms to Israel. Congress included an endorsement of the
                    sale in the Foreign Assistance Act enacted on October 8. President <persName
                        corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> responded with a statement that he had
                    authorized Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> to initiate
                    negotiations with Israel on the terms of the sale. In the negotiations that
                    followed, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_WPC1">Paul
                        Warnke</persName> attempted to make the sale of the planes conditional upon
                    Israel's willingness to shelve its nuclear weapons program. In his negotiating
                    sessions with Israeli Ambassador Yitzhak Rabin, <persName corresp="#p_WPC1"
                        >Warnke</persName> proposed a sales contract in which Israel would agree to
                    sign and ratify the recently negotiated nuclear non-proliferation treaty, and
                    would agree not to test or deploy strategic missiles. (306, 308, 309) <persName
                        corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> responded on November 8 that such
                    conditions infringed upon the sovereignty of Israel and were “completely
                    unacceptable.” (309) On November 9 Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RD1"
                        >Rusk</persName> and Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_CCM1">Clark
                        Clifford</persName> took the issue to President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1"
                        >Johnson</persName> who decided that the sale of the planes would be without
                    conditions. (311) The sale of 50 F-4 Phantom fighters was confirmed by an
                    exchange of letters between <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> and
                        <persName corresp="#p_WPC1">Warnke</persName>. (330, 332, 333) The Arab
                    reaction was summed up in a bitter letter of complaint sent by King
                        <persName>Hussein</persName> to President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1"

                </p>
                <p>The agreement to sell Phantom fighter-bombers to Israel introduced a powerful new
                    weapon into the Middle East. U.S. officials tried throughout 1968, however, to
                    curb the threat of the introduction of nuclear weapons into the region.
                        <persName corresp="#p_WPC1">Warnke</persName>'s effort to tie the sale of
                    the Phantoms to an Israeli endorsement of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty
                    was an expression of U.S. concern about a possible Israeli nuclear weapons
                    program. The potential introduction of nuclear weapons into the tinderbox of the
                    Middle East was viewed in Washington as a disastrous development, which carried
                    with it the danger that the Soviet Union might respond by putting nuclear
                    weapons into the United Arab Republic. The United States attempted to forestall
                    the threat by persuading Israel to sign the Non-Proliferation Treaty. During and
                    after the negotiation of the Treaty, letters were sent from <persName
                        corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_EA1"
                        >Eban</persName> and from <persName>Johnson</persName> to <persName
                        corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName>, urging Israel to join its Arab neighbors
                    in signing the treaty; these efforts, however, were to no avail. (155, 285)
                    Israel viewed its potential for nuclear capability as a brake on Arab aggression
                    that should not be discarded lightly. (189)</p>
                <p>Exchanges With the Soviet Union</p>
                <p>The dangers inherent in the situation in the Middle East led the United States
                    and the Soviet Union to agree on the importance of preventing a recurrence of
                    war. Although rivals for influence in the area, the United States and the Soviet
                    Union consulted regularly on the situation in the Middle East and joined in
                    supporting the <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> mission. U.S.
                    officials used the exchanges to try to persuade the Soviet Union to cooperate in
                    limiting the flow of weapons to the region. (57, 58) The Soviets took the
                    position that if Israel would withdraw from all Arab territory, as it
                    maintained, was stipulated by Resolution 242, there would be peace and the issue
                    of an arms race would not arise. (93) In the exchanges between Washington and
                    Moscow, Soviet officials held closely to the Arab line in the dispute. The
                    Soviet Union endorsed the Arab call for a phased withdrawal of Israeli forces
                    prior to a general understanding on peace. (93, 207) The United States viewed
                    this timetable concept as useful only if it served to implement a previously
                    negotiated arrangement for a comprehensive peace. (176) The Soviet Union felt
                    that the United States should use its influence to compel Israel to assume a
                    more flexible bargaining stance, and the United States felt that the Soviet
                    Union should use its influence with the Arabs to the same end. (57, 245, 274)
                    Both countries looked upon the gathering of Middle Eastern Foreign Ministers in
                    New York for the autumn session of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> General
                    Assembly as offering the best opportunity of promoting a settlement out of the

                <p>The meeting of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> General Assembly in

                    achieved any significant progress in his mediation efforts to that point, he did
                    secure the agreement of Israel and the Arab states to indirect discussions among
                    the Foreign Ministers in New York. <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>
                    was the conduit and facilitator of the discussions. Secretary <persName

                        >Jarring</persName>'s efforts by meeting at the United Nations with all of
                    the Foreign Ministers involved in the dispute. (268, 269, 301, 302) In a
                    November 2 meeting with <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> Foreign Minister
                    Riad, <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> put forward his own seven-point
                    formula for a peace settlement. (301) <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>
                    was no more successful than <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> in
                    stimulating a breakthrough in the negotiations. The Foreign Ministers left New
                    York no closer to a peace settlement than when they had arrived. <persName
                        corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> was understandably discouraged following

                    <hi rend="strong">The Climate of Conflict in the Middle East</hi>
                </p>
                <p>There was no respite from conflict in the Middle East. Palestinian terrorist
                    attacks against Israeli military and civilian targets in Israel and on the West
                    Bank formed a bitter backdrop to the peace negotiations throughout 1968. The
                    terrorist attacks were launched from bases in Jordan and through Lebanon from
                    bases in Syria. The Arab fedayeen used terror as a weapon to try to weaken
                    Israeli resolve to retain at least some occupied Arab territory. Israel
                    responded with reprisal attacks on terrorist bases. In March an attack blew up
                    an Israeli school bus carrying children, and Israel responded with a coordinated
                    air and ground attack on al-Fatah commando bases at Karameh in Jordan. (116,
                    119) The United States urged Israel to show restraint in dealing with the
                    terrorists, arguing that reprisal raids served the interests of the terrorists
                    by winning new converts to their cause, and also undermined the moderate
                    Jordanian Government. (117, 134) The United States urged Jordan to do everything
                    possible to try to control the fedayeen groups based in Jordan. On March 28
                    Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SHM1">Symmes</persName> was instructed to warn
                    King <persName>Hussein</persName> that the cycle of terrorism and retaliatory
                    raids could “degenerate to the point of no return.” (126)
                        <persName>Hussein</persName> used his army to try to control the fedayeen,
                    but the terrorist attacks continued and in May expanded to the border between
                    Israel and Lebanon, with the United States again urging restraint. (184,
                    192)</p>
                <p>On July 22 terrorist activities took on a new dimension when Palestinian
                    commandos hijacked an El Al flight bound from Rome to Tel Aviv and forced it to
                    land in Algeria. (223) After intervention by Italy and other interested parties,
                    the hijacking was resolved on September 1 when Algeria released the plane,
                    passengers, and crew. (228) It was clear, however, that the conflict between
                    Israel and Arab militants was no longer confined to the Middle East. In
                    September artillery duels developed across the Suez Canal as the United Arab
                    Republic initiated a limited war of attrition and Israel retaliated. (247) The
                    United States expressed concern to the authorities in Cairo and Jerusalem about
                    the dangers arising from the military exchanges along the Suez Canal, but the
                    exchanges continued. (251, 252) The year ended with the glare of international
                    publicity on the Arab-Israeli dispute. On December 26 newspapers around the
                    world gave banner treatment to an attack by the Popular Front for the Liberation
                    of Palestine on an El Al aircraft in Athens, Greece. An Israeli citizen was
                    killed and another was injured. The Popular Front was based in Lebanon, and
                    Israel held Lebanon responsible for the attack. On December 28 Israel retaliated
                    with an attack on Beirut International Airport, during which Israeli commandos
                    destroyed 13 Lebanese-owned aircraft. (367) The United States criticized the
                    Israelis over the attack, which it saw as disproportionate and directed at an
                    essentially innocent target. (369) Like many other such criticisms, however, it
                    was ignored by the Israeli Government. For President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1"
                        >Johnson</persName>, at the end of his administration, the fires burning at
                    the Beirut airport symbolized the failure of U.S. and international efforts to
                    find peace in the Middle East, and highlighted the dangers that lay ahead.</p>

                    Public Law 102-138, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1992
                    and 1993, which was signed by President <persName>George Bush</persName> on
                    October 28, 1991. Section 198 of <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 102-138
                    added a new Title IV to the Department of State's Basic Authorities Act of 1956
                    (22 USC 4351, et seq.).</p>
                <p>The statute requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be
                    a thorough, accurate, and reliable record of major United States foreign policy
                    decisions and significant United States diplomatic activity. The volumes of the
                    series should include all records needed to provide comprehensive documentation
                    of major foreign policy decisions and actions of the United States Government.
                    The statute also confirms the editing principles established by Secretary
                    Kellogg: the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series is guided by the
                    principles of historical objectivity and accuracy; records should not be altered
                    or deletions made without indicating in the published text that a deletion has
                    been made; the published record should omit no facts that were of major
                    importance in reaching a decision; and nothing should be omitted for the
                    purposes of concealing a defect in policy. The statute also requires that the
                    Foreign Relations series be published not more than 30 years after the events
                    recorded.</p>

                <p>The editor of the volume sought to present documentation illuminating
                    responsibility for major foreign policy decisions in the U.S. Government, with
                    emphasis on the President and his advisers. The documents include memoranda and
                    records of discussions that set forth policy issues and options and show
                    decisions or actions taken. The emphasis is on the development of U.S. policy
                    and on major aspects and repercussions of its execution rather than on the
                    details of policy execution.</p>
                <p>President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon Johnson</persName> and Secretary of
                    State <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Dean Rusk</persName> were directly involved in
                    the many discussions relating to the Arab-Israeli dispute, and the editor tried
                    to document their roles in the policy deliberations and decisions as much as
                    possible. Their meetings and correspondence with Arab and Israeli leaders, as
                    well as their responses to pressures from both sides to provide sophisticated
                    weaponry and their appointments of special emissaries to visit the troubled
                    region, for example, are included in the documentary record.</p>
                <p>Major topics covered in the volume include: U.S. efforts to promote the mediation
                    efforts of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Special Representative <persName
                        corresp="#p_JG1">Gunnar Jarring</persName>, U.S. interest in encouraging
                    negotiations between Israel and Jordan, the possibility of a rapprochement
                    between the United States and the United Arab Republic, U.S. concern over the
                    possible development of an Israeli nuclear weapons program, and the failure of
                    U.S. efforts to limit the flow of arms to the Middle East.</p>
                <p>The editor included a selection of intelligence estimates and analyses seen by
                    high-level policymakers, especially those that were made available to President
                        <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>.</p>

                </p>
                <p>The documents are presented chronologically according to Washington time or, in
                    the case of conferences, in the order of individual meetings. Memoranda of
                    conversation are placed according to the time and date of the conversation,
                    rather than the date the memorandum was drafted.</p>
                <p>Editorial treatment of the documents published in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series follows Office style guidelines, supplemented by
                    guidance from the General Editor and the chief technical editor. The source text
                    is reproduced as exactly as possible, including marginalia or other notations,
                    which are described in the footnotes. Texts are transcribed and printed
                    according to accepted conventions for the publication of historical documents in
                    the limitations of modern typography. A heading has been supplied by the editors
                    for each document included in the volume. Spelling, capitalization, and
                    punctuation are retained as found in the source text, except that obvious
                    typographical errors are silently corrected. <pb n="V" xml:id="pg_V" facs="0005"
                    />Other mistakes and omissions in the source text are corrected by bracketed
                    insertions: a correction is set in italic type; an addition in roman type. Words
                    or phrases underlined in the source text are printed in italics. Abbreviations
                    and contractions are preserved as found in the source text, and a list of
                    abbreviations is included in the front matter of each volume.</p>
                <p>Bracketed insertions are also used to indicate omitted text that deals with an
                    unrelated subject (in roman type) or that remains classified after
                    declassification review (in italic type). The amount of material not
                    declassified has been noted by indicating the number of lines or pages of source
                    text that were omitted. Entire documents withheld for declassification purposes
                    have been accounted for and are listed by headings, source notes, and number of
                    pages not declassified in their chronological place. All brackets that appear in
                    the source text are so identified by footnotes.</p>
                <p>The first footnote to each document indicates the source of the document,
                    original classification, distribution, and drafting information. This note also
                    provides the background of important documents and policies and indicates
                    whether the President or his major policy advisers read the document.</p>
                <p>Editorial notes and additional annotation summarize pertinent material not
                    printed in the volume, indicate the location of additional documentary sources,
                    provide references to important related documents printed in other volumes,
                    describe key events, and provide summaries of and citations to public statements
                    that supplement and elucidate the printed documents. Information derived from
                    memoirs and other first-hand accounts has been used when appropriate to
                    supplement or explicate the official record.</p>

                <p>The Advisory Committee on Historical Diplomatic Documentation, established under

                    recommendations concerning the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series.
                    The Advisory Committee monitors the overall compilation and editorial process of
                    the series and advises on all aspects of the preparation and declassification of
                    the series. The Advisory Committee does not attempt to review the contents of

                </p>
                <p>The Information Response Branch of the Office of IRM Programs and Services,
                    Bureau of Administration, Department of State, conducted <pb n="VI"
                        xml:id="pg_VI" facs="0006"/>the declassification review of the documents
                    published in this volume. The review was conducted in accordance with the
                    standards set forth in Executive Order 12958 on Classified National Security
                    Information and applicable laws.</p>
                <p>The principle guiding declassification review is to release all information,
                    subject only to the current requirements of national security as embodied in law
                    and regulation. Declassification decisions entailed concurrence of the
                    appropriate geographic and functional bureaus in the Department of State, other
                    concerned agencies of the U.S. Government, and the appropriate foreign
                    governments regarding specific documents of those governments.</p>
                <p>The final declassification review of this volume, which began in 1997 and was
                    completed in 2000, resulted in the decision to withhold about 1.1 percent of the
                    documentation proposed for publication; 6 documents were withheld in full. Most
                    of the withheld documentation was withheld because of a concern that it would
                    reveal information about intelligence sources and methods. Such information is
                    exempt from declassification under Executive Order 12958. The decision on a key
                    intelligence issue was appealed to a High-Level Panel consisting of senior
                    representatives from the Department of State, the National Security Council, and
                    the Central Intelligence Agency, established in 1998 to determine whether or not
                    a covert activity could be acknowledged by the United States. The Panel arrived
                    at a determination that resulted in the release of some but not all of the
                    appealed documentation. The editor is confident, on the basis of the research
                    conducted in preparing this volume and as a result of the declassification
                    review process described above, that the documentation and editorial notes
                    presented here provide an accurate account of U.S. policy in the Arab-Israeli
                    dispute from late November 1967 to the end of 1968.</p>

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> statute requires that the published
                    record in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series include all
                    records needed to provide comprehensive documentation on major U.S. foreign
                    policy decisions and significant U.S. diplomatic activity. It further requires
                    that government agencies, departments, and other entities of the U.S. Government
                    engaged in foreign policy formulation, execution, or support cooperate with the
                    Department of State Historian by providing full and complete access to records
                    pertinent to foreign policy decisions and actions and by providing copies of
                    selected records. Many of the sources consulted in the preparation of this
                    volume have been declassified and are available for review at the National
                    Archives and Records Administration.</p>
                <p>The editors of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series have complete
                    access to all the retired records and papers of the Department of State: the
                    central files of the Department; the special decentralized files (“lot files”)
                    of the Department at the bureau, office, and division levels; the files of the
                    Department's Executive Secretariat, which contain the records of international
                    conferences and high-level official visits, correspondence with foreign leaders
                    by the President and Secretary of State, and memoranda of conversations between
                    the President and Secretary of State and foreign officials; and the files of
                    overseas diplomatic posts. All the Department's indexed central files for these
                    years have been permanently transferred to the National Archives and Records
                    Administration at College Park, Maryland (Archives II). Many of the Department's
                    decentralized office (or lot) files covering this period, those that the
                    National Archives deems worthy of permanent retention, have been transferred or
                    are in the process of being transferred from the Department's custody to
                    Archives II.</p>

                    and other White House foreign policy records. Presidential papers maintained and
                    preserved at the Presidential libraries include some of the most significant
                    foreign affairs-related documentation from the Department of State and other
                    Federal agencies including the National Security Council, the Central
                    Intelligence Agency, the Department of Defense, and the Joint Chiefs of

                    the Middle East. Transcripts of President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1"
                        >Johnson</persName>'s conversations recorded in the Cabinet Room of the
                    White House added important depth to the record.</p>
                <p>Second in importance only to the White House records at the Johnson Library were
                    the records of the Department of State. Because the Ambassadors in the countries
                    of the region played a major role in the formulation of policy, the volume
                    includes a selection of telegraphic correspondence between the Embassies and the
                    Department of State. The Department's central files contain the cable traffic
                    recording U.S. diplomatic relations with Israel, the United Arab Republic,
                    Jordan, Lebanon, and other Arab countries; memoranda of diplomatic
                    conversations; and memoranda proposing action or providing information. Some
                    important documents are found only in the Department's lot files. The conference
                    files maintained by the Executive Secretariat contain briefing materials as well
                    as records of conversations. Documentation on initiatives that were not approved
                    is often found only in desk or bureau files. Files of the Bureau of Near Eastern
                    and South Asian Affairs provide insights into the roles played by key
                    policy-makers such as <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Joseph J. Sisco</persName> and
                        <persName corresp="#p_DRP1">Rodger P. Davies</persName>.</p>
                <p>Department of State historians also have access to records of the Department of
                    Defense, particularly the records of the Secretaries of Defense and their major
                    assistants and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p>
                <p>The Central Intelligence Agency provides the Department of State historians
                    access to intelligence documents from records in its custody and at the
                    Presidential libraries. This access is arranged and facilitated by the <gloss

                    Study of Intelligence, pursuant to a May 1992 memorandum of understanding.</p>
                <p>This volume includes a number of intelligence records. Among the intelligence
                    records reviewed for the volume were those in country and intelligence files at

                    operational files on the countries involved in the Arab-Israeli dispute, the

                    Bureau of Intelligence and Research.</p>
                <p>Almost all of this documentation has been made available for use in the Foreign
                    Relations series thanks to the consent of the agencies mentioned, the assistance
                    of their staffs, and especially the cooperation and support of the National

                <p>The following list identifies the particular files and collections used in the
                    preparation of this volume. The declassification and transfer to the National

                        facs="0015"/>the National Archives. The declassification review of other
                    records is going forward in accordance with the provisions of Executive Order
                    12958, under which all records over 25 years old, except file series exemptions
                    requested by agencies and approved by the President, should be reviewed for
                    declassification by 2000.</p>

                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SHM1">Symmes</persName> is concerned that
                        one of the first matters of business which the King will take up with him
                        when he returns to Amman November 26 is to ask what further response the
                            <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> may have made to his request for
                        arms. The Ambassador is certain that <persName>Hussein</persName> feels that

                        addition, the Ambassador points out that it will be indispensable to
                            <persName>Hussein</persName> in continuing to work for a political
                        settlement to have his Army solidly behind him. The Army, according to
                        reports reaching our Embassy, has been generating pressure on the Government
                        to resupply equipment lost during the June war. Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_SHM1">Symmes</persName> believes that the November 21
                        incidents, with the bombardment of the Karama refugee camp and the Israeli
                        air attack, will heighten this pressure. The Ambassador fears that if the
                        King becomes suspicious that we will not be able to help him out, he could
                        quickly become so frustrated that he might decide to go to the Soviets for
                        arms.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador reports that the Embassy expects within the next day or so a
                        list of those items whose delivery the Jordanian military command considers
                        absolutely essential.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador concludes his message by stating that our willingness to lift
                        our embargo on arms for Jordan and to exert efforts to <pb n="2"
                            xml:id="pg_2" facs="0030"/>help Jordan obtain arms from other suppliers
                        may soon become critical to our relationship.<note n="4" xml:id="d1fn4">In
                            telegram 74860 to Amman, November 25, the Department responded that the
                            question of arms for Jordan was under intensive review, but in view of
                            the complexity of the problem it was impossible to predict an outcome.

                            27 the Embassy reiterated the pressing need for a positive response to
                            the Jordanian Government's request for a recommencement of arms supplies
                            to Jordan. (Telegram 2395 from Amman; ibid.)</note>

                    <p>We subscribe to the Ambassador's analysis of the pressures which are working
                        on the King to procure arms to re-equip his Army and the likely consequences
                        if we are not in a position to help him. As soon as we have received the
                        list of items which the Jordan Army considers absolutely essential, we will
                        recommend to you a course of action with regard to the shipment of arms to
                        Jordan. In the meantime, we intend, as an interim measure, to query the King
                        as to the status of his efforts to obtain some of his requirements from
                        European sources in the event that we might be able to facilitate his
                        efforts. The Ambassador would make clear that in so querying the King we
                        were trying to be helpful and in no way indicating that we had decided not
                        to supply arms to Jordan.</p>

                            defensive capability and remain convinced that Israel retains sufficient
                            margin of safety for foreseeable future to permit orderly completion of

                            Our decision to unfreeze sizeable backlog of orders for parts and
                            components, to give continuing case by case consideration to new
                            pipeline requests, and to confirm delivery of A-4's under 1966
                            contract—a decision which was not politically easy for us—should
                            reassure <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> of our continued

                            Meanwhile, we do not discount potentially serious implications of
                                <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> speech—particularly
                            references to Suez Canal, withdrawal terms, and military
                            preparations—which, at very least, will make job of <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Rep more difficult. At same time, it
                            important to bear in mind that main purpose of speech appeared be to
                            boost domestic morale in context of somber review of enormity <gloss
                                target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> military defeat in June. On future
                            course of Arab-Israel problem there are number of ambiguities and
                            contradictions in speech which could, if <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                                >Nasser</persName> chooses, leave door open for some compromise. For
                            example, he (a) describes <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolution
                            as “insufficient” but does not reject it, and (b) while speaking of need
                            to prepare for new military round, acknowledges possibility that
                            political settlement may make this unnecessary. In latter connection,
                            possibly significant is <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s
                            statement that “We believe that reaching a sufficient degree of strength
                            may be a substitute for using it in fact.” Given past experience, we are
                            not inclined take comfort from any of this. At same time, we assume
                                <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> will agree it would be mistake
                            to assume on basis one speech in essentially domestic context that
                                <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s position completely
                            inflexible and that he is irretrievably launched on path to new war.
                            Negotiating process has dynamic of its own which must be allowed develop
                            before any final conclusions are reached.</item>

                            preparedness, we prefer base our judgment on what we know to be case and
                            not on such ambiguous, unsubstantiated and contradictory statements as
                            were contained in <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s
                            November 23 speech. For example, while he says in one place that “the
                            real power of our armed forces exceeds the real power prior to the start
                            of the battle,” he says in another that “our armed forces have restored
                            a considerable part of their military strength” and that “we must
                            realize that we cannot achieve everything all at once.” In context,
                                <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s comments about his
                            armed forces make clear that he envisages and is preparing his people
                            for a fundamental and long drawn-out process of reorganization and
                            rebuilding. Again, we do not discount potentially serious implications
                            of this, but we see in it no basis for altering our assessment of
                            present relative military strengths in <pb n="5" xml:id="pg_5"
                                facs="0033"/>area and time factors involved which, in our judgment,
                            remain in Israel's favor for foreseeable future.</item>

                                >Nasser</persName> relationship to see-saw, with

                                >Eshkol</persName> said he had hoped with some confidence that

                            hopes so but with considerably less confidence. The “superlatives” of

                            his estimate is that Israel will be in a ratio of one to three in light
                            of Soviet replacements to Egypt, worse if Algerian reinforcements should
                            be forthcoming, and this only after arrival of last of 48 A4s which not
                            scheduled until 1969. He thinks this ratio is too dangerous for Israel

                            State's most helpful <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss>
                            (obviously without <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss> section). He made
                            no particular comment, except to reiterate his growing doubts as to
                                <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s intentions. I also
                            urged that, despite his present uneasiness about the attainment of a
                            peaceful settlement, he should not abandon hope of success at the end of
                            what would be a hard road. He agreed. Further, I remarked that as the
                            events of May and June receded in peoples' memory, Israel will have to
                            give increasing attention to her image in the world. Her position as the
                            victim of an attempt by her neighbors to annihilate her becomes less
                            credible the longer she sits in her present posture as an occupying
                            power in large areas. She must exercise the “magnanimity of the victor”
                            in her own interest. <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName>
                            concurred, reminding me that I had once commented that Israel is now the
                            power in the Middle East and has additional responsibility in the search
                            for peace. He concluded that all this is dependent on Israel having real
                            security, to which his present requests are directed.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>. Various readers of this message will
                        recall that this air force imbalance has given me concern since the Soviet
                        replacement program to Egypt began, and I had several occasions to mention
                        it when in Washington recently. I do not take issue with our military
                        experts' conclusion that for some time to come, Israel will be superior
                        overall in military capability to any likely combination of powers which may
                        be ranged against her, and this probably whether we make the additional 77
                        planes requested available or not. But I submit that, if the Israelis
                        themselves do not think so, their increased nervousness will be likely to
                        make them at worst tend toward more adventurous courses to avoid possibly
                        imaginary Arab efforts to exploit such imbalance, and at best more difficult
                        to persuade to take steps involving increases to their security risks, which
                        may be necessary if progress is to be made toward final peace. Also, despite
                        expert assessments, I would like to see from a strict consideration of US
                        interest in stability in the region, that additional margin of safety to be
                        provided by these airplanes in the hands of responsible (also could read,
                        non-Soviet) Israelis. Accordingly, as <pb n="7" xml:id="pg_7" facs="0035"
                        />heretofore, I continue to endorse these requests and urge US agreement as

                            <item>I asked Bob what he thought the Egyptians would do about
                                acknowledging that we were not involved in the war and reparations.
                                He said they took the view that their official newspapers have
                                already <pb n="8" xml:id="pg_8" facs="0036"/>published in Cairo the
                                fact that we were not involved and it would be very difficult for
                                them to go further. As for reparations, they would be made when
                                diplomatic relations were established, but not immediately, because
                                they were terribly short of money. Bob
                                <persName>Anderson</persName>'s view was that this could be the
                                first issue we raised after diplomatic relations were

                                lesson; and that it is in our national interest to establish

                            <item>His mission to Iraq is to get American firms involved in
                                exploiting the biggest sulphur deposits in the world. A personal
                                letter to the Iraqi President from de Gaulle had been sent urging
                                that French firms take the contract. Bob is reasonably confident
                                that his more experienced firms will win out.</item>

                        Ambassador points out that it will be indispensable to
                            <persName>Hussein</persName> in continuing to work for political
                        settlement to have his Army solidly behind him. The Army, according to the
                        Embassy, is not pressing for full replacement of equipment lost last June,
                        but is seeking reassurance that the King has a plan to obtain certain
                        priority items. The Ambassador believes that the November 21 incidents with
                        the bombardment of the Karama Refugee Camp and the Israeli air attack will
                        heighten Army pressure on the King. The Ambassador fears that if the King
                        becomes suspicious that we will not be able to help him out he will quickly
                        become so frustrated that he might go to the Soviets for arms. The
                        Ambassador further argues that our willingness to lift our embargo on arms
                        for Jordan and to exert efforts to help Jordan obtain arms from other
                        suppliers may soon become critical to our relationship. King
                            <persName>Hussein</persName> informed the Ambassador on November 28 that
                        the Jordan Army leadership was pressing him very hard and stressed that the
                        need for him to take some action was “becoming a matter of days.”</p>

                    <p>The Ambassador has discussed Jordan's requirements with General <persName

                        Army, who maintains that the list which he gave Colonel Jordan last August
                        represents the Army's current minimal essential requirements. Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_SHM1">Symmes</persName> and the Defense Attaché
                        have come up with a sanitized version. It includes <pb n="10" xml:id="pg_10"

                        Jordan's complete desires nor it requirements. The Ambassador does believe
                        that the revised list would meet <persName>Hussein</persName>'s main need to
                        hold the loyalty of the Jordanian Army and at the same time would avoid
                        serious embarrassment at the forthcoming Arab Summit, reportedly scheduled

                    </p>
                    <p>Our short-term stake in Jordan is clear. <persName>Hussein</persName> has
                        taken the initiative and leadership on the Arab side in seeking a settlement
                        with Israel. He can probably do this only with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                            >Nasser</persName>'s support. Dubious as the prospects for a settlement
                        are now, they may well become nil should <persName>Hussein</persName> fall
                        or be forced into a more radical posture. To a large extent he has staked
                        his lot on working with the West and particularly the US. Consequently he is
                        seeking arms from us not only because he needs them but also because of the
                        tangible evidence of US support which the supply of such arms would give
                        him. There would be a gap between the time of our informing him of our
                        willingness to supply him arms and the delivery of these arms. The
                        announcement itself, however, would tend to strengthen
                            <persName>Hussein</persName>'s position vis-a-vis the Army as well as
                        bolstering his position vis-a-vis the radical Arabs. It would have a
                        stabilizing influence in Jordan at the time the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                            >UN</gloss> Special Representative begins his important mission.</p>
                    <p>He has been trying since last June to secure arms from the US. He was given
                        in August what a reasonable man could interpret as a US commitment to supply
                        him arms. He asked again when he was recently in Washington. Jordan is the
                        only Eastern Arab state which considers it has legitimate arms requirements
                        and is making little or no progress in meeting them. It is difficult for
                            <persName>Hussein</persName> to justify to his people his continued
                        reliance on the West. Those who have worked with the Soviet <pb n="11"
                            xml:id="pg_11" facs="0039"/>Union can more convincingly prove the
                        benefits from their association.</p>
                    <p>Our position in Jordan has declined since the war. The Embassy reports
                        increasing frustration and bitterness by the Jordanians against the US. The
                        Jordanians consider our Near Eastern policy discouragingly under the
                        influence of the Zionists and the Israelis. Nonetheless we still have
                        resources in Jordan but their strength is waning. The pattern of our
                        relationship is being steadily whittled away.</p>
                    <p>The few arms which Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SHM1">Symmes</persName>
                        recommends we provide<note n="3" xml:id="d5fn3">Some of this equipment would
                            be sold to the <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> and some items could
                            be provided under the <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> as previously
                            scheduled. [Footnote in the source text.]</note> could help arrest this
                        trend. The quantity is small and could hardly constitute a threat to Israel
                        or alter the arms balance in the area. The Joint Staff considers the
                        ammunition requested as minimal in both quantity and type. The most deadly
                        item, the 106 mm recoilless rifle, is primarily an anti-tank gun and lacks
                        the protection needed for offensive deployment. The arms requested are
                        replacements for a portion of the arms lost in fighting and not additions to
                        Jordan's arsenal.</p>
                    <p>We shall encourage the <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> to seek European
                        suppliers for some of its requirements particularly in the heavy weapon and
                        aircraft fields. We do not think we should do so for this list. As a matter
                        of fact, for some of the items such as spares it is not practical. In
                        general, procurement of this type of ground equipment from West European
                        sources would create further problems for the Jordanian Army as its
                        training, maintenance facilities and tactical doctrine are now based
                        primarily on US weapons. More important, however, is the impact that a
                        refusal to carry out our previous commitments would have on <gloss
                            target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss>
                        relations. A ruler in <persName>Hussein</persName>'s position has an obvious
                        need for a reliable source of external support—both economic and military.
                        If we tell the King that he is on his own and should shop for weapons
                        wherever he can obtain them from Western sources, he will feel that we are
                        opting out of the role of external supporter. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                            >USSR</gloss> has offered to take over this role and there is a real
                        danger that the King, under pressure from <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                            >Nasser</persName> and the radical Arabs, may decide that Soviet
                        sponsorship, with all its drawbacks, is the best of the options left open to
                        him. The actual weapons involved are of less significance than the symbolic
                        value to <persName>Hussein</persName> and to his Army of our continued
                        willingness to play the role of supporter.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>The only valid reason why such small sales cannot be made available is
                        because the Zionists and Israel, unless otherwise persuaded, can <pb n="12"
                            xml:id="pg_12" facs="0040"/>cause difficulties in Congress and elsewhere
                        if we send any arms to Jordan.</p>
                    <p>We think that our own interests in this matter are of sufficient importance
                        to justify a difference of opinion with the Israelis and their domestic
                        partisans here. We strongly urge that we go ahead on arms for Jordan. If you
                        agree, we suggest (a) that you consult again with Congress and (b) that Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> or
                            <persName>Rostow</persName> inform the Israelis. It should be made
                        clear, however, that whereas we would endeavor to persuade Western Europeans
                        to supply arms to Jordan, we, in our own interest, should continue to
                        provide small quantities ourselves. Our rationale would be the strengthening
                        of <persName>Hussein</persName>'s position to permit him to proceed on the
                        path of settlement with the Israelis and to maintain his moderate
                        pro-Western position.</p>
                    <p>We recommend that:</p>
                    <p>(1) You raise the issue of Jordan arms along the lines discussed in this

                            transcript of the Khartoum conference reveals no consciously conceived
                            two-phase plan</hi>. In fact, the radical leader of the Palestine
                        Liberation Organization tried to force the leaders there to focus on
                        solution of the overall Palestine problem, and they literally shouted him
                        down. They insisted that the only subject they were discussing was how to
                        get the Israelis out. They talked abut rebuilding military strength, but
                        mainly so they don't have to negotiate flat on their backs and in order to
                        use force eventually if political means fail.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">The truth about Khartoum, I think, is that <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> hasn't really thought beyond
                            Israeli withdrawal one way or another.</hi> There was almost no talk at
                        Khartoum about the “lasting peace” we talk about. And the Israelis are
                        probably right in fearing that leopards don't change their spot. But for the
                        moment, we don't think they're talking about a second phase, if any.</p>
                    <p>The same, incidentally, is true of the Israelis. Yaacov Herzog, <persName
                            corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName>'s Chef de Cabinet, told me two weeks
                        ago that Israeli leaders are deeply divided over whether they should risk a
                        political settlement, if the right terms can be negotiated, or sit tight on
                        their expanded boundaries and rely for survival on the added military
                        security they provide. He says he won't know for sure what Israeli strategy
                        is until the Cabinet votes on a specific proposal (though he thinks “peace”
                        will win).</p>

                            arrive until after first of year. I hoped this was true because it would

                            arrive. It might be before end of year. Soviet Ambassador in informing
                            him only a few days ago of mission's coming had stated mission would
                            include three senior military officials but that latter would not be

                            his arms from usual sources. Nevertheless, he had not felt he could tell

                            and had stressed Israel's right to existence. Soviet <gloss
                                target="#t_Amb1">Amb</gloss> had also spoken of Soviet efforts to
                            dampen Syrian extremism. He considered Soviets, despite some outward
                            appearances, had been playing a generally constructive role with regard
                            to Arab-Israeli problem. This factor also led him to feel he could not
                            tell Soviets not to send mission at this time or not to bring military
                            personnel if they did. On other hand, it was his intention to see that
                            Soviet military only looked around in general way and that they did not
                            get into any specific discussion of Jordan's requirements. This was
                            understood, he emphasized.</item>

                        <item>I commented that His Majesty was, of course, best judge of <gloss
                                target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> interests in this respect. Some of us,
                            however, still have suspicions about Soviet motives in the Near East.
                            Only in last few days Soviets had been making noises of willingness to
                            discuss some form of arms limitation in area; yet with Jordan they were
                            pursuing what could only be considered a significantly new arms supply
                            role in Near East. Although Soviets more cautious and seem to recognize
                            danger of escalation of Arab-Israeli incidents, some of us still believe
                            they will pursue their <pb n="20" xml:id="pg_20" facs="0048"/>spoiling
                            operations in Near East wherever possible. I personally was suspicious
                            enough of their motives to wonder if they could be counted on to keep
                            presence in Jordan of three military personnel quiet.</item>

                            completed on foreign aid appropriation bill. I thought this could be

                                    Need for good will on both sides extends beyond negotiations
                                    themselves to general posture and actions of parties. Policies
                                    and actions leading to mistrust and tension in area can be just
                                    as detrimental to chances for success as positions taken in
                                    negotiations themselves. Posture assumed and policies embraced
                                    by govts at Arab Summit very important in this regard.</item>

                    <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Harman</persName> said that, while <persName
                            corresp="#p_WBGE1">Weizman</persName> had made clear his request looked
                        to future and not based on fear of imminent attack, latest information on
                        Arab capabilities, coupled with increasingly bellicose Arab statements, now
                        gave request added sense of urgency. Any indications <pb n="24"
                            xml:id="pg_24" facs="0052"/>of Israeli weakness would encourage attack.
                        Israel therefore needed additional aircraft to provide credible deterrent
                        or, in event irrational Arab actions in face of such deterrent, to assure
                        its survival. Further factor was French arms policy which not only deprived
                        Israel of aircraft it had already contracted for but, if latest press
                        reports re lifting of French embargo for Iraq were correct, indicated Iraq
                        might get planes originally intended for Israel. <persName corresp="#p_HA1"
                            >Harman</persName> said two schools of thought existed in Arab world,
                        one favoring resort to force and other urging moderation. Israel needed
                        strength to convince Arabs that force would not work. This would bolster
                        moderates and contribute to success of <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                            >Jarring</persName> mission.</p>
                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_BLD1">Battle</persName> asked if Israel was
                        convinced French would not deliver on Mirage contract. <persName
                            corresp="#p_HA1">Harman</persName> said he feared this was the case. In
                        any event Israel must now base its planning on assumption it would get no
                        aircraft from France. In response further question from <persName
                            corresp="#p_BLD1">Battle</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_HA1"
                            >Harman</persName> said Israel had found no possibility of obtaining
                        Mirage aircraft through third countries. Further disturbing factor was new
                        info that Soviets to supply Arabs all-weather <gloss target="#t_MIG1"
                            >MIG</gloss>-23's in 1968.</p>
                    <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Harman</persName> stressed that <persName
                            corresp="#p_WBGE1">Weizman</persName> request looking toward inventory
                        of 250 modern aircraft by late 1968 had shaved margin very fine. That
                        request had assumed French would deliver, and failure receive Mirages would
                        thus aggravate already serious situation. <persName corresp="#p_HA1"
                            >Harman</persName> said he detected tendency in <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                            >USG</gloss> to overrate Israeli ability and hoped we would not give
                        Israel benefit of too many doubts. In response Battle comment that we based
                        our assessment on past Israeli performance, <persName corresp="#p_HA1"
                            >Harman</persName> said that previous success had come from knocking out
                        Arab airforces on ground. Arabs were aware of this and now planning
                        accordingly. Fifty planes could literally make difference between life and
                        death of Israel.</p>
                    <p>5. Battle commented that we shared Israeli concern about Soviet resupply and
                        other activities in area and were watching them carefully. We did not
                        believe Soviet resupply had brought Arab forces above pre-war levels or had
                        altered their basic nature. Views might differ on relative strengths of Arab
                        and Israeli forces and we might not agree with Israeli assessment, but we
                        remained sensitive to Israel's security needs. <persName corresp="#p_WBGE1"
                            >Weizman</persName>'s request was receiving urgent consideration and we
                        hoped to have reply soon.</p>
                    <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_BLD1">Battle</persName> said we were particularly
                        concerned about arrival of Soviet bombers in Egypt and about Soviet airlift
                        of equipment to Yemen. Re former, we had no indications that bombers to
                        remain in Egypt permanently, but if such visits became a pattern this was
                        nevertheless a serious development. <persName corresp="#p_HA1"
                            >Harman</persName> asked whether we had considered raising this question
                        at high level with Soviets. <persName corresp="#p_BLD1">Battle</persName>
                        said we had not. On other hand, we had raised arms control problem in
                        general with Soviets on number of occasions. We were not discussing this
                        subject with <pb n="25" xml:id="pg_25" facs="0053"/>Soviets at the moment
                        but wouldn't rule out possibility should right moment come.</p>
                    <p>7. Re Yemen, <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Harman</persName> thought situation
                        difficult for Soviets whose only access was by air. He speculated that
                        advantage lay with those who had strength on ground and thought Royalists
                        therefore might have upper hand. This was factor which various forces in

                    <p>8. Turning to new subject and emphasizing that he knew Israeli views and did
                        not expect <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Harman</persName> to comment,
                            <persName corresp="#p_BLD1">Battle</persName> said Israel should know
                        that we still had question of arms for Jordan under consideration. We had
                        not reached decision, and if we did decide go forward, it would be on modest
                        scale. We had evidence, however, that Soviets were prepared to provide
                        Jordan anything it wanted. Situation in Jordan was extremely delicate and we
                        would need to come to decision in next few weeks. In response <persName
                            corresp="#p_HA1">Harman</persName>'s question whether Jordan exploring
                        France as source of supply, <persName corresp="#p_BLD1">Battle</persName>
                        said there had been some talk of this but to best our knowledge it had
                        gotten nowhere and French had in fact made no offer to Jordanians.</p>

                            <persName>James Birdsall</persName> was a lawyer who practiced in New
                            York and had developed contacts in the United Arab Republic in his
                            capacity as attorney for ALCO Products. His contacts in Egypt were
                            facilitated by the Geneva representative of ALCO, a Mr.
                                <persName>Siddiqui</persName>, who was Pakistani. In October 1966
                                <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> invited
                                <persName>Birdsall</persName> to Egypt to discuss his desire to
                            improve U.S.-<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> relations and his
                            belief that the United States was determined to overthrow his
                            government. See <ref target="frus1964-68v18#d341">

                        this morning.</p>
                    <p>2. <persName>Birdsall</persName> says he was given “formal message” by
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> to be delivered to no one
                        except President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>. (<persName
                            corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> told <persName>Birdsall</persName>
                        that not even his Foreign Minister aware <persName>Birdsall</persName>'s
                        presence Cairo.)</p>
                    <p>3. From Birdsall's subsequent long and rambling conversation feel fairly sure
                        about contents of “formal message.” <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                            >Nasser</persName> believes that Russians are increasing their pressure
                        on him and that in absence any ties with <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                        he increasingly powerless to resist. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                            >Nasser</persName> hinted at strong Russian pressure re use of
                        Alexandria, possibly involving permanent fueling facilities and barracks for
                        Soviet naval personnel. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> also
                        complained about magnitude of Sov concentration in <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                            >UAR</gloss> armed forces.</p>
                    <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> said he willing accept
                        non-belligerency with Israel with all that implies. If Israel will pay just
                        and adequate compensation to Palestinian refugees, <persName
                            corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> will exchange Ambassadors with
                        Israel.</p>
                    <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> was quite contrite for the
                        grave mistakes he made in May and June, and acknowledged that Egyptians had
                        been soundly defeated, mostly because they did not know how to use Soviet
                        weapons. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> also expressed regret
                        for past speeches he made accusing <pb n="27" xml:id="pg_27" facs="0055"
                        />U.S. of “war of starvation” and so forth, indicating some of these
                        statements had been made to please Soviets.</p>
                    <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> wishes resume diplomatic
                        relations with the United States. He wants some time to consult with other
                        Arabs but feels he can encourage other Arab states which broke relations he
                        has no influence whatsoever.</p>
                    <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> said he fully understood
                        that there no question resumption any form U.S. economic aid to <gloss
                            target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> for foreseeable future.</p>
                    <p>8. Re big lie, <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> made ingenuous
                        statement that he had never accused <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> of
                        military participation in June war. He claims that all he did was quote
                            <persName>Hussein</persName> directly on this point. (<hi rend="italic"
                            >Comment:</hi> If that is case, why did <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                            >UAR</gloss> break relations with U.S.?)</p>
                    <p>9. <persName>Birdsall</persName> leaving Cairo today for London and plans
                        return New York December 14. He will upon arrival request meeting with
                        President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>. His thesis will
                        doubtless be that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> cannot afford stand
                        idly by in face of Soviet takeover of <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                        and ultimately other Arab states in Eastern Mediterranean.</p>
                    <p>10. Recommendation: I would hope that if all possible President <persName
                            corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> could receive
                            <persName>Birdsall</persName> if only for a few moments before turning
                        him over to White House or Departmental advisers.<note n="3" xml:id="d13fn3">
                            <persName corresp="#p_BDC1">Bergus</persName> telegraphed his assessment
                            of <persName>Birdsall</persName>'s conversation with <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> from Cairo on December 13. He
                            believed <persName>Birdsall</persName>'s report because he thought
                                <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> was desperate to
                            enlist the United States as a counterbalance to the Soviet Union.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BDC1">Bergus</persName> recommended a
                            reassessment of U.S. policy toward <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"

                            for some time, and he could not envision a settlement of the Middle East
                            crisis that did not presuppose tolerable relations between the United

                        appointment with the President when we get it.</p>
                    <p>Although we certainly don't want to cut off any reasonable communication, I

                    <list>
                        <item>—<persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> is sending whatever
                            this message is without even the knowledge of his Foreign Minister.
                            Given our questions about who speaks for the <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                                >UAR</gloss> today, I wonder how much credence we could give to
                            whatever <persName>Birdsall</persName> says even if he is reporting
                            accurately.</item>
                        <item>—<persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s reported comment that
                            he will exchange Ambassadors with Israel is so far out of line with
                            everything else we have that it causes me to question either the
                            accuracy of <persName>Birdsall</persName>'s reporting or <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s mental consistency and
                            stability.</item>
                        <item>—As you said when we talked about this a couple of weeks ago, the time
                            has come when the Egyptians have to stop giving us vague signals under
                            the grandstand and give us their requests through a reasonable channel.
                            In retrospect, it is clear that we could have gotten ourselves in a
                            terrible bind by responding to one set of signals last summer that could
                            have tied us into the whole Amer conspiracy. Coupled with our worries is
                            the request to <persName corresp="#p_BDC1">Don Bergus</persName> when he
                            arrived that we consider him our main point of contact to the exclusion
                            of all others.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>State will have its recommendation for us shortly but I wanted to give you
                        these thoughts in case <persName>Birdsall</persName> should get home
                        early.</p>

                                >Johnson</persName>, with the same subject heading. The memorandum
                            laid out to greater length the policy options and recommendations and
                            posed the option of whether the President wanted the Department to
                            proceed with consultations with Israel and Jordan on the basis of those
                            recommendations. There is no indication on either memorandum of the
                            President's response.</note> We have deliberately given you these
                        various options, although I am sure you will recognize that the choices on
                        Jordan are narrow indeed.</p>
                    <p>It may be useful to you, in making this difficult decision, to have my views
                        on how you might play it—particularly in light of the potential domestic
                        problems.</p>
                    <p>Israel has asked for 27 A-4 Skyhawk aircraft, to be delivered in 1969. (These
                        are in addition to the <hi rend="italic">48</hi> Skyhawks now scheduled for
                        delivery in 1968). It has also asked for <hi rend="italic">50</hi> F-4
                        Phantom jets, to be delivered in 1969-70.</p>
                    <p>The military balance is in Israel's favor and should remain so for at least a
                        year. But I believe there is a legitimate Israeli concern about their
                        continued air superiority beyond 1968.</p>
                    <p>King <persName>Hussein</persName> is pressing hard for some arms
                        deliveries—both as evidence of our continued support and to meet minimum
                        equipment needs for his defeated army.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Hussein</persName>'s position is threatened by his efforts in
                        favor of a settlement, his association—in Arab eyes—with the West, and his
                        resistance to attractive Soviet arms offers.</p>
                    <p>If it can be done without endangering Israel's security, it is in our
                        national interest—as well as Israel's—to avoid further substantial US arms
                        commitments until we know more about the chances for a negotiated
                        settlement.</p>

                            atmosphere. He said he had found feeling in Europe that Israeli position
                            is “hardening,” even among officials who knew that Israel's official
                            goals for negotiation have not changed.</item>

                            <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Harman</persName> commented that problem of
                            terrorism—all, in his view, emanating from Syria—could be dealt with
                            only in three ways. Jordanians could interdict terrorists within Jordan
                            (he said there had recently been a raid coming directly into Israel from
                            Syria; the others all crossed via Jordan). Or Israelis could interdict
                            in territory held by Israel. Or, after a time, if that didn't work,
                            Israelis might have to undertake another raid to cool situation a bit.
                            In retrospect, worst mistake <persName corresp="#p_HA1"
                                >Harman</persName> had to reproach himself with, he thought, was the
                            recommendation that Israel to go Security Council in fall of 1966 rather
                            than strike directly against Syria. The Soviet veto in the instance and
                            the weakness of the Western position, led straight to Samu, and then to
                            May and June. Could war have been prevented by a hard blow against Syria
                            a year ago?</item>

                        <item>Rostow said we recognized full gravity of problem of terrorists. We
                            were inclined to think that for moment a stronger U.N. presence between
                            Israel and Jordan could be helpful.</item>

                            <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Harman</persName> dismissed the idea. U.N.
                            forces had done no good. Problem was too large to be dealt with by a
                            border patrol. It had to be met within Jordan, or, if saboteurs
                            penetrated the West Bank, by Israel within the area. Israel was getting
                            good cooperation from West Bank people, who were more and more
                            disenchanted with Amman, and inclined to help Israelis. In any event,
                            U.N. forces had proved their inadequacy. Right procedure was that of
                            cooperation between the Israeli and Jordanian forces. When Jordanian
                            interests were involved, Jordanians met Israelis at Allenby Bridge. But
                            when issue was that of stopping terrorism, Jordanians raised an issue of
                            political principle. With Security Council Resolution passed, Jordanians
                            should begin to take a less belligerent posture, and forget absurd idea
                            that they cannot talk with Israelis.</item>

                                <item>Article 53 specifically prohibits destruction by occupying

                                    where such destruction is rendered “absolutely necessary by
                                    military operations.” Israeli measures such as destruction of
                                    Jiftlik do not constitute “military operations,” since
                                    hostilities are ended and cease-fire is in effect.</item>

                            <p>The Soviets have just taken the unprecedented step of intervening
                                actively in the Yemen war by employing Soviet-manned aircraft
                                against Royalist forces. In Arab eyes this gives further credibility
                                to the prospect of Soviet direct intervention elsewhere.</p>
                        </item>
                    </list>
                    <p>The question is whether this escalation in the Soviet involvement should
                        remain unchallenged. If it does Arab policy will be based on the assumption
                        of eventual Soviet supremacy. It is earnestly recommended that the Soviet
                        Government be apprised of the U.S. Government's concern and serious
                        reservations over these far reaching maneuvers. The absence of any United
                        States reactions will encourage further Soviet intrusions. The psychological
                        effects of passivity will be grave both in the Soviet and Arab context. At
                        the present stage the political effects are stronger than the strictly
                        military effects. The tendency noticed in November for Arab governments to
                        attach decisive weight to United States influence will be dissipated.</p>
                    <p>Furthermore we strongly urge the U.S. Government to come to an early and
                        positive decision on Israel's pending request for additional military
                        aircraft. Such a decision would have the following positive effects: <list>

                            <item>It will have a sobering effect on Egyptian planners and
                                policy-makers. They know that <hi rend="italic">hundreds of aircraft

                                    has reached Israel</hi>. It would be extraordinary in such a

                            <item>It is essential to demonstrate the U.S. determination to ensure a
                                viable balance of armament in the area. The French defection has
                                helped to create an impression that Israel can soon be intimated. It
                                is astonishing to record such a position so soon after the June
                                fighting. The chances of progress in the United Nations conciliation
                                effort are considerably less than they were a few weeks ago, as a
                                result of these cumulative disturbances in the existing and
                                prospective balance of power. To allow this derangement to proceed
                                without counterbalancing action would, in our view, be an error of
                                great scope.</item>

                    </p>
                    <p>Experience shows that decisions of war or peace in this region are determined
                        not so much by the reality of strengths as by the impression and appearance
                        of it. The significance of the above developments would not be greatly
                        affected by an objectively positive analysis of American power or Israel's
                        strength. The danger lies in the impression that American and Israeli
                        strength have for some months been static, while Soviet and Arab capacities
                        have been growing in swift momentum.”</p>
                    <p>2. In the ensuing conversation <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName>
                        elaborated on this presentation with particular reference to the
                        psychological and political effects he sees resulting from the increased
                        Soviet presence in the Middle East. Reiterating the Israeli assessment
                        reported on various occasions that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                            >Nasser</persName> and the Egyptians appear embarked on a two-pronged
                        policy (A) an effort to achieve a political solution on their terms if
                        possible and (B) at the same time rebuilding their military potential to
                        such an extent that if a political solution fails or they ultimately decide
                        that they prefer a renewal of hostilities they will be in a position to
                        defeat Israel at the next attempt, <persName corresp="#p_EA1"
                            >Eban</persName> said that he felt in November <persName
                            corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> was definitely emphasizing the
                        desirability of alternative (A), a political solution, but that there are
                        now serious indications that he is less dedicated to that course. This
                        change <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> attributes to the
                        psychological impact of recent moves in the area. <persName corresp="#p_EA1"
                            >Eban</persName> is apprehensive that if this is the case the Egyptians
                        will be less anxious to reach agreement politically than they would have
                        been heretofore. His particular concern is not a real imbalance in US-Soviet
                        force in the area in the favor of Soviets but rather the appearance of
                        additional Soviet activity which might have such an effect on Arabic
                        thinking as to influence them in direction of unrealistic further adventures
                        or, obviously a lesser but still serious course, might persuade them toward
                        adamancy in political negotiation. Turning to a question of arms supply to
                        the Middle East and particularly US arms for Israel, <persName
                            corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> again stressed the psychological
                        importance of a favorable decision on the <persName corresp="#p_WBGE1"
                            >Weizman</persName> requests as a demonstration of U.S. determination to
                        counter effectively Soviet moves. He assumed that Israel would not get
                        French Mirages. But he <pb n="36" xml:id="pg_36" facs="0064"/>stressed that
                        even if they did eventually it would not affect the validity of Israel's
                        present request to the U.S. As for numbers, even before the June hostilities
                        Israel assessed its requirements until 1970 as 75 A-4's and 100 Mirages. The
                        first 50 of the latter to be acquired 1968 to be followed by additional 50
                        in '69. With the rearming by the Soviets of Egypt and other this Israeli
                        requirement still remains valid. Thus the 27 A-4's and 50 Phantoms requested
                        by <persName corresp="#p_WBGE1">Weizman</persName> are necessary regardless
                        of whether the 50 Mirages come from France or not. <persName
                            corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> concluded by expressing view that he
                        hoped firmly, based on the <persName corresp="#p_WBGE1">Weizman</persName>
                        conversations and his own subsequent ones in Washington, that U.S. would not
                        argue about numbers perhaps on a theory which would not make sense to him
                        that a few more or less would have some useful effect in lightening the
                        impact of U.S. supply. On contrary, if we should do so the psychological
                        counter to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would be diminished and
                        Israel would in effect be left in dangerously short position on these
                        essential defense items.</p>
                    <p>3. I said that while I did not have anything in addition to what he has been
                        told in Washington as to the present state of U.S. consideration of this
                        matter, it is my understanding that the problem is being actively pursued. I
                        added that I felt Israeli concerns have been clearly enunciated and brought
                        to the attention of appropriate authorities in Washington<note n="2"

                    <p>We don't believe we can string King <persName>Hussein</persName> along much
                        longer. A Soviet economic delegation with a few military members is in
                        Jordan now. The King feels he has to give his army some assurance that US
                        equipment will be available or consider Soviet offers.</p>
                    <p>Nick thinks we should do something before Christmas. He recommends a small
                        package from pre-war programs (roughly $6.5 in spares, automotive and commo
                        gear, some anti-tank guns and ammo). He knows the Israelis won't like this,
                        but says it won't affect the arms balance. He proposes letting the key
                        members of Congress know what we plan to do and then informing King

                            thinking about pressures to respond to requests from Israel and Jordan
                            for arms. <persName>Johnson</persName> responded: “Just say no decision

                    </p>
                    <p>That would leave us with the problem of how to handle Israeli aircraft
                        requests. As you know, they've asked for (a) 27 additional A-4 Skyhawks to
                        be delivered in 1969 on top of the 48 that will be delivered in 1968 and (b)
                        50 F-4 Phantoms for delivery in 1969-70.</p>
                    <p>The questions with Israel are not so much “whether” but “when” and “how
                        many.”</p>
                    <p>In principle, Secretaries <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> believe we should go
                        ahead with the 27 additional Skyhawks to replace Israel's war losses and
                        provide a margin of safty. They do not belive we have to decide on th 50
                        Phantoms until later in 1989 since the Arab-Israeli military balace today is
                        at least as favourable to Israel as it was on June 5.</p>
                    <p>Nick would perfer not to give the Israelis a definite answer now because he
                        does not want to do anything to jeopardize Ambassador <pb n="38"
                            xml:id="pg_38" facs="0066"/>
                        <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>'s peacemaking mission or
                        trigger a new round of Arab demands on Moscow. He would like to hold off at
                        least until <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName>'s visit in early
                        February. To meet predictable Israeli pressures, he'd assure them that we
                        can't decide for another month or two but we will take steps to be sure that
                        this delay will not delay eventual delivery of the aircraft if we go ahead.
                        He would also say that, if the military balance tips sharply against Israel,
                        we would be prepared to divert aircraft from other contracts to meet
                        Israel's needs quickly.</p>
                    <p>The alternative is to go ahead with 27 Skyhawks now to balance our move with
                        Jordan. With the substantial Soviet resupply to the Arabs over the summer,
                        no one could argue seriously that 27 aircraft to Israel would upset chances

                            The Arab-Israeli balance today is at least as favorable to Israel as on
                            June 5. The question is how quickly we must act to keep pace with Soviet
                            resupply. The 48 Skyhawks we are already delivering will replace
                            Israel's war losses by the end of 1968 and bring Israel's air strength
                            qualitatively somewhat above its June 5 level. General <persName
                                corresp="#p_WBGE1">Weizman</persName> asked for 27 more Skyhawks and
                            50 F-4 Phantoms to increase that level (from 200 to 250) and permit
                            modernization. Everyone agrees that we should go ahead with the 27 added
                            Skyhawks soon and hold on the Phantoms until the need is clearer (e.g.
                            French decision on 50 Mirages). But a debate on timing ranges between
                            these choices: <list>

                                >Battle</persName> that he would have to report to Cairo that he had
                            failed in his mission. <persName>Rostow</persName> noted that <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> would be certain to regard such
                            a failure as a personal rebuff, and he therefore recommended that the
                            President meet with Birdsall. (Ibid.)</note> President <persName
                            corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> had asked him to convey expressions

                        between the United States and the United Arab Republic. President <persName

                        endeavor to induce other Arab countries who broke with the United States to
                        resume relations.</p>

                        bring about an Israeli withdrawal. At the same time President <persName
                            corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> would permit himself to accept a
                        “state of nonbelligerency” between the United Arab Republic and the

                            >Johnson</persName> will make a gesture of friendship to the Arab
                        nations. At the same time he understands United States relations with the

                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> would appreciate an

                    <p rend="flushleft">Dear Nick:</p>
                    <p>We have looked into the problems involved in delaying a final decision on the
                        sale of A-4H Skyhawk and still making delivery, if it later seems desirable
                        to do so, within a reasonable period of time. We have also looked again at
                        the availability of F-4 aircraft.</p>
                    <p>We have several possible lines of approach to the problem of A-4Hs.</p>
                    <list>
                        <label>A.</label>
                        <item>First, we could postpone any decision for up to a year and deliver the
                            first of the additional 27 A-4Hs 24 months after a final contract and
                            agreement with the Israelis. This would be the normal delivery lead
                            time.</item>
                        <label>B.</label>
                        <item>Second, we could postpone <hi rend="italic">any</hi> decision until
                            after Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName>'s
                            February visit and still deliver the first of the additional 27 A-4Hs in
                            January, 1970. This would require a commitment of from $1.1 to $9.4
                            million in funds, either U.S. or Israeli, for procurement of long lead
                            time items, if a final decision and agreement is not made by April
                            1968.</item>
                        <label>C.</label>
                        <item>Third, we could make a tentative decision before 1 January 1968, and
                            commit from $7.6 to $12.3 million in <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>
                            funds to advance procurement of long lead time items. We could then
                            delay a final decision until May, 1968 and still deliver the first of
                            the additional 27 A-4Hs in May or August 1969.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>This third alternative, however, would require that the Israelis agree to a
                        stretch-out into 1969 of the delivery of the latter portion of the 1966 buy
                        of 48 A-4Hs. Also, the commitment of <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>
                        funds for such an advance procurement of long lead time items will present
                        some problems, especially if we cannot reach a final decision and agreement
                        with Israel by May, 1968. There would also be some loss to <gloss
                            target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> if the tentative decision and commitment of
                        funds were not followed by a sale, but this may be partly offset if the
                        Israelis were willing to buy some of the items peculiar to the A-4H for
                        maintenance of the 48 A-4Hs they are now receiving.</p>
                    <p>More specific information on the second and third alternatives (B and C)
                        analyzed by <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> are attached.<note n="2"

                    <p>The crucial points as I see them are whether we are prepared to commit from
                        $7 to $13 million in <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> funds by 1 January
                        1968 for advanced procurement of long lead items; how important it is to be
                        able to deliver the first of the 27 additional A-4Hs before 1 January 1970;
                        and when we will be ready to make a final decision and agree with Israel to
                        sell the 27 additional A-4Hs.</p>
                    <p>With respect to F-4 Phantoms, we can delay the decision for a year or more
                        and still deliver the first F-4s 24 months from point of contract. Delivery
                        to Israel in less than 24 months from date of final agreement would mean
                        either diversion from active U.S. Navy or Air Force units or from U.S.
                        production earmarked for these units; or advance procurement of long lead
                        time items as in the case of the A-4H.</p>
                    <p>We continue to believe that to introduce F-4s into the Near East in the
                        foreseeable future may well escalate the arms race, is not now necessary
                        from a military point of view, and could hurt our overall position in the
                        area. The major difference between Arab and Israeli military effectiveness,
                        as was demonstrated last June, is in the intangibles of leadership,
                        organization, training, maintenance, logistics, morale, and unity of action
                        rather than numbers of aircraft. But should the French fail to deliver the
                        Mirage V to Israel or should Arab capabilities rise appreciably as a result
                        of Soviet supply and training assistance, we may wish to reverse this
                        recommendation. We will continue to watch the military situation
                            closely.<note n="3" xml:id="d22fn3">On December 19 the <gloss

                            threat to Israel which drew the conclusion that “There have been no

                            further increases in the Israeli aircraft inventory.” They added,
                            however, that the situation could change if the Soviet Union continued
                            aircraft deliveries to the Arab states, or if France failed to deliver
                            the Mirage aircraft Israel had contracted to receive. (Ibid., Israel

                    <p>Mr. <persName>James Birdsall</persName> called me on Wednesday, December 20,
                        to report that he had received a call from Mr. <persName>Siddiqi</persName>
                        who wanted to know whether Mr. <persName>Birdsall</persName> had been able
                        to deliver the communication from President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                            >Nasser</persName> to President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1"
                            >Johnson</persName>. Mr. <persName>Siddiqi</persName> had received a
                        call from Mr. <persName>Hafiz</persName> in Cairo who indicated once again
                        that he had spoken for President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                            >Nasser</persName>. Hafiz apparently had stated that Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> was eager for a reply as soon as
                        possible and intended to issue a statement praising President <persName
                            corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> as a man of peace, assuming a
                        favorable reply was forthcoming to the communication. It was suggested also
                        (by whom was not clear) that Mr. <persName>Birdsall</persName> return to
                        Cairo and give his reaction to President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1"
                            >Johnson</persName> [<hi rend="italic">
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
                        </hi>?], as well as convey any reply. Mr. <persName>Birdsall</persName>,
                        while he repeatedly said that he wished to do whatever we wanted him to do,
                        obviously would like nothing better than to make another trip to convey the
                        message. I informed him that the reestablishment of diplomatic relations
                        between two countries always required detailed negotiations, paperwork,
                        etc., and it was also imperative that we get the matter, assuming agreement
                        in principle, into governmental channels. Mr. <persName>Birdsall</persName>
                        agreed and then made a series of arguments in favor of his own continued
                        involvement. I told Mr. <persName>Birdsall</persName> that in view of the
                        President's trip to Australia he would not have an opportunity to deal with
                        this matter for at least a week. Mr. <persName>Birdsall</persName> had
                        already conveyed to the Egyptians that the President was away and that he
                        (Mr. <persName>Birdsall</persName>) could not possibly make a trip before
                        the early part of January. I agreed to be back in touch with Mr.
                            <persName>Birdsall</persName> when we had had an opportunity to consider
                        the matter further.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Birdsall</persName> said that he had informed the Egyptians
                        that the President had received him warmly and that both Mr.
                            <persName>Rostow</persName> and I had been very constructive in our
                        approach to the matter. He also had told the Egyptians that he was sure a
                        reply would be forthcoming and that it would be both polite and helpful.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>A distinct shift in Israeli attitudes has become apparent in recent weeks.
                        It's hard to know whether the new attitude derives from a new appraisal of
                        the situation or whether the Israelis have decided that their new line will
                        serve better in pushing us toward an arms decision.</p>
                    <p>The new line seems to be to emphasize Soviet activity in the Middle East
                        above all else. The unexpected Soviet moves in Yemen—on which Israeli
                        intelligence is almost as good as ours—and the Soviet bomber visit to Cairo
                        have at least coincided with this shift, if not caused it.</p>
                    <p>The main operational result of the shift in emphasis is that the Israelis
                        seem more resigned to our resuming some military assistance to Jordan. It is
                        impossible for them to say that the biggest threat facing them is this
                        increased Soviet activity and yet still say that they don't care whether
                        Jordan accepts a substantial Soviet presence. Even <persName
                            corresp="#p_EE1">Evron</persName> is now willing to conceive that
                        resumption of some military aid to Jordan appears the lesser of evils.</p>
                    <p>It may simply be that we have convinced the Israelis that the Jordan arms
                        decision is tied to their aircraft decision and that the aircraft override
                        all other considerations for them. In this case, we can consider that we've
                        worn them down. It may be however that the Israelis also genuinely fear the
                        implications of being surrounded by Soviet-influenced governments.<note

                            Ones</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>You will recall approving last May the sale to Israel of 100 new Armored
                        Personnel Carriers.</p>
                    <p>The Israelis have now said they don't intend to buy these new <gloss
                            target="#t_APC1">APC</gloss>s if we will release 375 surplus World War
                        II half-track personnel carriers for them to cannibalize. Apparently they
                        captured enough new equipment in June to hold them for the moment and are
                        mainly concerned with keeping their present inventory operational. The old
                            <gloss target="#t_APC1">APC</gloss>s they want originally went to our
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies and are now back in our
                        control as surplus in French and Italian depots. Of the 375, 143 are the
                        balance of a sale we had already authorized last March but suspended when
                        war broke out.</p>
                    <p>Secretaries <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and <persName
                            corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> recommend that we go along with
                        this Israeli proposal. This would avoid introducing a new and modern piece
                        of heavy equipment into the Israeli inventory, and the deal would attract
                        less attention from the Arabs. Our approval would be consistent with your
                        recent decision to supply spare parts to the Israeli military since these
                        would be cannibalized. From the Israeli side, the half-tracks have the
                        advantage of immediate delivery and cost only about $130,000, contrasted to
                        the 18-months lead time and $3.5 million for new vehicles.</p>
                    <p>I am checking this with you mainly because of your personal battle for the
                        new <gloss target="#t_APC1">APC</gloss>s last spring. I assume, however,
                        that you would have no problem with this suggestion since this is what the
                        Israelis want and it is easier for us.</p>
                    <p>The only question is whether we go ahead now or wait till you've seen
                            <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName>. Since we get the better
                        end of this deal, I'd be inclined to tuck it under our belts right now. We
                        don't get a great deal of credit for letting them have what everybody else
                        has now laid aside as military <pb n="47" xml:id="pg_47" facs="0075"/>junk.
                        However, even though aircraft will be the main focus of your talk with
                            <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName>, you may want to give the
                        impression of a hiatus in decisions before he comes.</p>

                            December 28, reported on a December 27 conversation between Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_SHM1">Symmes</persName> and Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_TB1">Talhouni</persName>. <persName

                                corresp="#p_TB1">Talhouni</persName> “let down his hair” and stated
                            that he regarded the U.S. decision to discontinue budgetary support for
                            Jordan as another sign of U.S. disapproval of him personally. <persName
                                corresp="#p_TB1">Talhouni</persName> added that some leading members
                            of his government felt that discontinuing budgetary support, like the
                            failure to resume arms shipments to Jordan, was meant to punish Jordan
                            for its role in the June war, and constituted economic pressure to force
                            Jordan to agree to a Middle East settlement on Israel's terms.

                                >Talhouni</persName>'s reaction to our decision to discontinue
                            budget support highlights psychological considerations that require us
                            to move quickly if we want to prevent further deterioration of our
                            relations with Jordan. We believe it is generally accepted that a
                            moderate Jordanian regime with which we can maintain a constructive
                            dialogue will be a highly important, perhaps decisive, element in a
                            viable solution to the Arab-Israel dispute. In the longer term,
                            moreover, a moderate Jordan with a reasonable Western orientation should
                            be an asset in dealing with the now greatly expanded Soviet presence in
                            the Middle East. Conversely, an unfriendly, unstable Jordan would tend
                            to contribute to further Soviet gains and would generally undermine the
                            force of moderation in this area.</item>

                        <item>We still have a chance—however fragile—to achieve a reasonably stable
                            solution of the Arab-Israel impasse, yet in Jordanian eyes we appear at
                            this same time to be diminishing sharply the material evidence of our
                            support that has been the basis for our relationship and influence with
                            Jordan. We have continued the ban on military supplies for Jordan—even a
                            minimum of spare parts and logistic equipment—while we have released
                            major arms, including aircraft, to Israel and other Arab countries. We
                            suddenly (albeit with sound economic rationale) cut off budget support
                            to Jordan. We have carried forward a minimum program of technical
                            assistance and have only one smaller development loan project going. A
                            major American company (Grace) pulled out of Jordan's potash scheme on
                            “political” grounds, thereby putting the entire complex package in
                            jeopardy. We have not yet been able to authorize commencement of
                            negotiations of an estimated $3 million PL 480<note n="3"

                            than a month after a formal note of request was submitted. In contrast
                            to the British who in very straitened circumstances are paying their
                            budget support through 1967, we propose not to fulfill the total of $27
                            million budget support in 1967 (as we had previously indicated). Instead
                            we propose to substitute a grant for up to $3 million for feasibility
                            and sectoral studies and the aforementioned PL 480 sales agreement for
                            the expected $6.2 million fourth quarter payment.</item>

                        <item>The Jordanian reaction to such actions as discontinuance of budget
                            support must be evaluated against the very real and growing
                            vulnerability of both the regime and the country to political and
                            economic deterioration. The Jordanians argue they are far from self
                            supporting economically, and they have past experience of the
                            unreliability of Arab aid. We are well aware of their innate fiscal
                            conservatism from our discussions with them in brighter periods. Now
                            this conservative fiscal approach makes them distinctly reluctant
                            (particularly in the present murky political climate) to spend to the
                            limit of current liquid resources or to start down the slippery slope as
                            they see it of internal borrowing to meet major, chronic budget gaps.
                            The Jordanians are fully aware they can meet their foreseeable cash
                            outlays in the coming twelve months; but they see themselves being cut
                            afloat with a very uncertain future and no basis for future
                            planning.</item>

                            however, that considerably more of a positive nature is going to be
                            needed if we are to deal adequately with the psychological problems we
                            face. We see a real need to move quickly on number of fronts.</item>
                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>Release of military shipments is an essential first step. (This may
                            also facilitate the dialogue on budget support.) While we must continue
                            and expand the dialogue we have already started on the shift from budget
                            support to more effective evidence of our continued support for Jordan.
                            As noted above, urgent action on the PL-480 program (we hope by the new
                            year) and offer of a grant of $3 million for specific development
                            purposes will be helpful. However, these two elements—especially the
                            latter—unfortunately will tend to be caught up in probable recrimination
                            over our failure to pay the total 1967 budget support as promised.
                            Something more is clearly needed. Tangible progress on the potash scheme
                            is perhaps the most promising possibility. We should encourage Tenneco
                            to make a move as soon as possible to confirm its interests and
                            intention. At the same time, we should take the initiative to get the
                            World Bank to express willingness to move ahead on the overall scheme
                            without private partner if Tenneco does not intend to proceed. On the
                            problem of showing US support in published budget, reference to existing
                            loan availabilities may help. Even more useful would be the possibility
                            of saying something in the budget document about our intention to make
                            the potash loan in calendar 1968 (thus either USFY 68 or 69).</item>
                        <label>7.</label>
                        <item>On the budget support question itself, perhaps we could suggest to the
                            Jordanians a specific timetable for review of Jordan's fiscal situation,
                            e.g. August-September 1968. This might be more concrete evidence of
                            continuing concern for their economic situation and thus ease their
                            feelings of uncertainty. We would reaffirm readiness to review earlier
                            in event of unforeseen developments or need.</item>
                        <label>8.</label>
                        <item>The most valuable assistance we can afford Jordan in the period
                            immediately ahead is support for certain necessary elements in the
                            political settlement with Israel as envisaged under the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolution, especially a viable
                            arrangement on Jerusalem. The King and his advisors have already shown
                            unease as to the actual meaning of the support we have promised. Their
                            adherence to the moderate course condirected at political settlement—no
                            matter how much they desire it—is <pb n="51" xml:id="pg_51" facs="0079"
                            />conditioned by the extent to which they believe it is possible. Both
                            the establishment and the Jordanian public see the US role as critical,
                            and they continue to look for something tangible to confirm the US
                            intention to provide this support. A strong public or even private
                            statement consistent with our even-handed policy, or a position that
                            favored Jordan on some key issues, preferably Jerusalem or possibly on
                            refugees, could have significant favorable effect. If we can find some
                            way to make our promise of support for an acceptable settlement more
                            credible, or if we can take some action that will clearly demonstrate
                            our ultimate intentions and capacity to deliver, the problem of
                            developing a rational and mutually satisfactory overall relationship
                            will be greatly simplified. Conversely, if our demonstration of our
                            capacity effectively to support a satisfactory settlement is
                            inconclusive in the immediate future, the achievement of understanding
                            and acceptance of our posture including aid will be much more
                            difficult.</item>

                        <item>It is his quite objective judgment that we are on the way to losing
                            the Middle East rapidly. In a matter of months there will be a military
                            confrontation in which the Soviet Union will be prepared not only to arm
                            the Arabs, but directly to engage, perhaps via technicians, if not more
                            openly. They will use the same techniques as we have used in Vietnam and
                            a similar rationale; namely, that they have a right to help their
                            friends deny others acquisition of their territory. The Israelis have no
                            more right to impose their government on the West Bank of Jordan than
                            the North Vietnamese have a right to impose their government on the
                            South. They will accuse the Israelis of aggression; and, as we know, the
                            concept of aggression can be defined in ways that suit the interests of
                            the party making the definition.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>Bob said that he is wholly aware of our legitimate sense that the Arab
                            leaders have proved themselves unreliable. They have created by their
                            own statements and actions a monster in their public opinion which makes
                            it impossible for them to negotiate directly with Israel. They are
                            widely divided among themselves except on the issue of Israel.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>Specifically, Bob believes it is unwise for us—and unwise for <pb
                                n="53" xml:id="pg_53" facs="0081"/>the Israelis—to increase Israeli
                            arms in order to balance Arab arms acquired from the Soviet Union. He
                            believes it would be a disaster if we made dramatic announcement when
                                <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName> is here of increased
                            arms for the Israelis. It would be tantamount to a U.S. commitment to
                            engage the Russians directly in the Middle East.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>Positively, we believes we must now make a move towards the Arab
                            moderates. We must indicate that our concept of territorial integrity
                            applies not only to Israel, but to the Arabs. We must pick up <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s offer to re-establish
                            relations promptly and not insist on our concept of apologies. The
                            Russians are unpopular throughout the Arab world. There are moderates
                            who want peace. They will accept any amount of U.S. commitment to the
                            integrity of Israel and its borders. They will accept the President's
                            five points of June 19.<note n="2" xml:id="d28fn2">See <ref

                            appear to throw out weight fully behind Israel and ignore their

                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>We must understand, Bob says, that in the Arabs we are dealing with a
                            different breed of cat than any others in the world. To them, face is
                            more important than substance. It means more to them than to the
                            Israelis or to us. Moreover, he believes that if we help them save face,
                            we have the possibility, if we ac fast, of getting a livable settlement
                            for Israel which would block Soviet influence out of the Middle East, He
                            underlined that we must more fast. He concluded that we are on the edge
                            of a war in the Middle East, at least as serious for us as Vietnam,
                            unless we balance our accounts with the moderate Arabs and avoid, on the
                            occasion of the <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName> visit, any
                            dramatic move in the arms field with Israel which would polarize the
                            Arab world again and lay the basis for their turning once and for all to
                            Moscow.</item>

                                withdrawal and a peace settlement. Ambassador <persName

                                possible to encourage the Arabs to negotiate rather than fight. We
                                don't know what this will bring, but we've told the Arabs we'd put
                                our weight behind Jarring.</item>

                            from King <persName>Hussein</persName> to President <persName

                            urgent basis. <persName>Hussein</persName> indicated that he was and
                            remained a friend of the West and had no desire to buy arms from the
                            Soviet Union. He noted that he had been patient in waiting for a U.S.
                            decision to resume arms shipments to his country. To meet U.S. concerns
                            in making that decision, <persName>Hussein</persName> offered an
                            assurance that if the United States supplied Jordan's needs he would not
                            buy military equipment from the Soviet Union. He offered that assurance,
                            he noted, on the assumption that in due course Jordan's legitimate
                            requirements would be met. He added that it was imperative that he be
                            able to say that Jordan's military requirements were being satisfied by
                            the time of the scheduled Arab Summit meeting on January 17. To pave the
                            way for the necessary understanding, <persName>Hussein</persName>
                            proposed to send his Chief of Staff, General <persName corresp="#p_KGA1"
                                >Khammash</persName>, to Washington as soon as possible to meet with
                            the appropriate U.S. authorities. (Johnson Library, National Security

                        <item>I saw King <persName>Hussein</persName> this afternoon to take up
                            reftel. I told him I had another personal message for him from the
                            President and explained <pb n="55" xml:id="pg_55" facs="0083"/>that the
                            President would like assurances we would not subsequently be faced with
                            Jordan's acceptance of Soviet arms offers.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>King responded that providing such assurances gave him no difficulty
                            at all. This had always been his understanding of arms arrangements with
                            us. He has no desire to buy arms from the Soviets provided his
                            legitimate requirements can be met by the United States. He said he
                            realized that resumption of shipments would not “bring tanks to Jordan
                            immediately.” But he did need to have a clear understanding of what the
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> is prepared to do for Jordan. In
                            giving us assurances about not going to the Soviets he did not want to
                            be left in position of having some of his essential requirements
                            unsatisfied.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>I responded that shipments to be resumed initially would include some
                            of items on General <persName corresp="#p_KGA1">Khammash</persName>'s
                            “emergency list.” I said I saw this as an important beginning. It would
                            remove pressures from him and would give us all time to see what success
                                <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> would have. We would
                            all gain time to form a better picture of what kind of military
                            establishment Jordan would need in the years ahead.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>The King said he would want in any case to have General <persName
                                corresp="#p_KGA1">Khammash</persName> proceed at once to the US to
                            discuss Jordan's requirements. I said I recognized he would want
                                <persName corresp="#p_KGA1">Khammash</persName> to discuss Jordan's
                            requirements in detail at some point, but I believed it should be put
                            off until things had settled a bit, until we could see where we
                            stood.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>At this point King asked if I could wait while he called <persName
                                corresp="#p_KGA1">Khammash</persName> to the Palace to join our
                            discussion. When <persName corresp="#p_KGA1">Khammash</persName> arrived
                            we went over most of the same ground again with <persName
                                corresp="#p_KGA1">Khammash</persName> emphasizing that he could not
                            keep the army loyal to the King if Jordan was only to be provided with a
                            “few spares” and other equipment from his “emergency list.” He was not
                            asking for all of Jordan's needs at once, but he believed His Majesty
                            would have to have a clear understanding of what the <gloss
                                target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> proposes to do beyond the “emergency
                            list.” Discussions with the Soviets could be postponed, but Jordan was
                            faced with a summit meeting on Jan 17 and had to be in a position to
                            state authoritatively that its needs were going to be met by the <gloss
                                target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>. Revival of the UAC is on the summit
                            agenda, and he (<persName corresp="#p_KGA1">Khammash</persName>) has
                            already been told that Jordan and other Arab countries at the summit
                            will be expected to indicate how their re-equipping is being
                            accomplished. Beyond this, there is the seriously deteriorating morale
                            of the Jordan army to be considered. They had to have an idea of what
                            comes after the “emergency list.”</item>
                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>Discussion went back and forth over the same ground. The King at one
                            point introduced the Israeli F-4 Phantom request and said he earnestly
                            hoped the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> would not take this step.
                            In the course of our conversation I, of course, emphasized that buying
                            Soviet arms might help to meet a short-term problem but would in its
                            train bring a host <pb n="56" xml:id="pg_56" facs="0084"/>of long-term
                            problems. The King's comment was “I am sorry to have to say that you
                            will have been responsible if that happens.”</item>
                        <label>7.</label>
                        <item>Our discussion was concluded with the King suggesting an oral message
                            to the President. We went over the substance of such a message several
                            times, and it has been transmitted separately.</item>
                        <label>8.</label>
                        <item>
                            <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> I tried throughout conversation to talk
                            the King into going along with a general statement of resumption of
                            shipments at this time and putting off a <persName corresp="#p_KGA1"
                                >Khammash</persName> visit until we could see where things were
                            going. Both he and <persName corresp="#p_KGA1">Khammash</persName> were
                            prepared for such moves on my part and had no intention of leaving
                            things fuzzy. Although they did not say so, it was obvious that
                                <persName corresp="#p_KGA1">Khammash</persName>'s visit would mean
                            much to them psychologically. It would be a sign that we had moved back
                            together and would be so interpreted by Jordanians and other Arabs. Both
                            the King and <persName corresp="#p_KGA1">Khammash</persName> made a
                            special point of emphasizing “legitimate requirements,” and they
                            reiterated statements made in other recent conversations to the effect
                            that if <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> is successful,
                            their longer term military requirements would change. Although they were
                            fairly insistent that they will need to know before January 17 what we
                            are prepared to do (with the implication that this means the longer
                            term), we believe that discussions with <persName corresp="#p_KGA1"
                                >Khammash</persName> need not take the form of a complete long-term
                            statement of force goals and equipment. It seems to us that it would be
                            acceptable to the King and <persName corresp="#p_KGA1"
                                >Khammash</persName> if we approached the problem in stages. We
                            could resume shipment of our recommended list now and try to agree with
                                <persName corresp="#p_KGA1">Khammash</persName> on making up some of
                            Jordan's other losses and deficiencies in a series of stages. This will
                            enable both sides to buy time and provides, we believe, sufficient scope
                            for <persName corresp="#p_KGA1">Khammash</persName>'s discussions to
                            satisfy the King before the summit meeting.</item>
                        <label>9.</label>
                        <item>The object of this whole exercise has been to buy time, to maintain
                            our position here while a Middle Eastern settlement is being worked out.
                            This object is still important to us, and therefore we strongly
                            recommend that <persName corresp="#p_KGA1">Khammash</persName> be
                            invited to proceed to Washington as requested by the King.</item>

                        The Israelis presumably know all of this, although they may not know how

                        On the plus side, he has gotten the Israelis to release 500 Egyptian

                    <p>The Israelis are still taking the position that peace treaties have to be

                        must withdraw its troops as the first step. There is no indication that

                    <p>The Jordanians also are pushing for an Israeli withdrawal, but haven't
                        revealed their position on the specifics of a solution.</p>
                    <p>The Lebanese appear willing to accept almost any solution, but they're the

                        highly indirect dialogue going between the Israelis and the Arabs, both

                            >Jarring</persName> himself says he doesn't expect too much. It looks as

                            with Khouly and tell him you have Presidential oral and written messages

                                        >Nasser</persName>'s desire for resumption of relations. It
                                    is imperative, I believe, that diplomatic relations be resumed
                                    in a climate conducive to friendship between our two countries.
                                    Diplomatic relations cannot be isolated from the attitudes of
                                    trust and confidence that they should represent, and I would
                                    suggest that each of us examine <pb n="60" xml:id="pg_60"
                                        facs="0088"/>ways in which we can improve the atmosphere
                                    both in the United States and in Egypt. I have in mind, for
                                    example, an effort to clarify public misapprehensions
                                    surrounding the unfortunate events of June 5. It is inconsistent
                                    with friendship to leave an impression that the United States
                                    engaged in military actions against his people which caused loss
                                    of life and hardship, when we in fact had no part in them. Mr.

                                    non-belligerency with Israel. We hope he shares our belief that
                                    a resumption of hostilities is unthinkable. With regard to his
                                    request that I use my influence to get the Israelis to withdraw,
                                    the United States Government is prepared to put its full weight
                                    behind a reasonable settlement of the Arab-Israel dispute within
                                    the terms of the November 22 Security Council Resolution, which
                                    I am pleased that the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                                    supported. As President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                                        >Nasser</persName> knows, that resolution affirms that a
                                    just and lasting peace should include Israeli withdrawal as well
                                    as the termination of all claims and rights of belligerency. To
                                    achieve this end, I think it essential that all of us cooperate
                                    fully with the Secretary General's personal representative,
                                    Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>, and
                                    that we seek to find a settlement all parties can accept. I
                                    assure him of my willingness to cooperate with all parties in an
                                    effort to bring success.</item>

                                <item>It is not clear what President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                                        >Nasser</persName> has in mind in asking that I make a
                                    gesture of friendship to the Arab nations and we are not sure
                                    whether Mr. <persName>Birdsall</persName> has reported this
                                    request accurately and in its proper context. Perhaps President
                                        <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> would wish to
                                    clarify. In meantime, I would like to point out that we have
                                    long sought to maintain an even-handed policy as between the
                                    Arab states and Israel and to have good relations with both
                                    sides, and we have helped in the economic development of the
                                    entire Middle East. The deterioration of our relations with the
                                        <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> in the past year has
                                    been due largely to unfortunate misunderstanding of our motives
                                    and tragic suspicions as to our intentions. If now the <gloss
                                        target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> wishes to move into a new
                                    period of friendship based on trust, I think friendly and
                                    mutually satisfactory relations are possible. If they are not
                                    ready, I do not think isolated gestures of friendship by either
                                    side will have much effect. There must be a basic wish for
                                    meaningful relations and a determination to bring them
                                    about.</item>

                                water resources will be fully committed by the mid 1970's, and
                                further expansion of water supply for industry and agriculture in

                            <item>It has been recognized from the outset that the plant would not
                                meet conventional economic criteria for <gloss target="#t_AID1"
                                    >AID</gloss> financing, and that some additional financial
                                assistance would be required. This is often the case for
                                multipurpose power and irrigation projects. Because of the large
                                investment involved, the cost of the water produced by the project
                                will depend heavily on the terms of financing. Financing which would
                                lead to a water cost of no more than 30 cents per 1000 gallons
                                (corresponding to an average interest rate of 2.7%) may allow Israel
                                to proceed with the project, although Israel will undoubtedly
                                propose a much lower target initially.</item>

                    <p>You are so fully immersed in this problem that I need not go into detail, but
                        I do want to found up for you in capsule form where we stand on each major
                        point you will be discussing. I am attaching a one-page checklist of these
                        points, an interpretation of <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName>'s
                        political position and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1"

                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName> was sent to the
                            White House on January 5 under a covering memorandum from <persName
                                corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, which incorporated suggested
                            talking points. The interpretation of <persName corresp="#p_EL1"
                                >Eshkol</persName>'s political position was in a January 5

                                <hi rend="italic">The main issue—peace</hi>. The real issue between
                                us is that the Israelis think the Arabs will come around if they
                                just sit tight and we think the Israelis may have to go more than
                                half way to get the Arabs to negotiate. We can't dictate Israeli
                                tactics, and we may not even know of some secret contacts. But we
                                must be assured that the Israelis aren't going to sit themselves
                                tight right into a “fortress Israel” that we would not want to be
                                tied to. In this context, <persName corresp="#p_EL1"
                                    >Eshkol</persName> may ask you what kind of support he can count
                                on from the US if he gambles territorial security for an uncertain
                                peace deal with the Arabs.</p>
                            <p>One point we haven't discussed with you recently is our willingness
                                to facilitate Arab-Israeli contacts anywhere it makes sense. We
                                don't want to get in the middle, but we think it would be worth
                                offering to help if we can be useful.</p>

                            Israelis shouldn't just sit tight we have in mind specifically their:
                            proposing a refugee settlement that would include compensation and some
                            repatriation; offering <persName>Hussein</persName> some accommodation
                            in Jerusalem; letting refugees from the June war back onto the West
                            Bank; evacuating Tiran Island which is Saudi territory; and avoiding
                            further actions that convince the Arabs they're just consolidating their
                            conquests.</item>

                                <hi rend="italic">Nuclear weapons and missiles</hi>. We have been at
                                the Israelis ever since your last talk with <persName
                                    corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName> in 1964 to get assurance that
                                they won't go nuclear or acquire surface-to-surface missiles. The
                                most they'll say is that they won't be the first to introduce
                                nuclear weapons into the Mid-East and that they're developing
                                missiles with French help just “in case they have to counter Arab
                                missiles.” We'd like to stop the Mid-East arms race short of either
                                weapon, but so far we haven't made much headway.</p>
                            <p>With prospects for an <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> improving,
                                we may have a new handle on this problem. I think we ought to make
                                it clear that we expect Israel to sign and that we think Israel's
                                long-term security will be well served by signing. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName> may say he can't give up his
                                nuclear option unless he can be assured that the Arabs won't achieve
                                conventional superiority. I think we might well pose that problem to
                                the Russians if <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName> makes
                                it a condition for signature. It might also be worth finding out
                                whether he'd give up getting missiles if the Soviets would not give
                                them to the Arabs.</p>

                                >Eshkol</persName> may claim that Israeli action in June stopped the
                            momentum of Soviet-<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> gains. We're not
                            so sure. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> lost a few yards in
                            June, and we set them back in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. But
                            they seem to have picked themselves up quickly to exploit new openings
                            in the area. I think we want to shake <persName corresp="#p_EL1"
                                >Eshkol</persName>'s reliance on Israeli force and intransigence to
                            stop the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. We think a peace
                            settlement is the only thing that can give any of us a real chance to
                            build a Mid-East where constructive nationalism and regionalism can
                            block the Soviet thrust. Meanwhile, we want <persName corresp="#p_EL1"
                                >Eshkol</persName>'s acceptance of our resuming aid to
                            Jordan.</item>

                            <hi rend="italic">Vietnam</hi>. You will be the best judge of what would
                            help you most. We've had one report via Dick Helms that <persName
                                corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName> may be thinking of an open
                            endorsement of our Vietnam effort and even some active help. We ought to
                            look at that pretty carefully because it would further fix the image of
                            Israel as our stooge—an image we need to blur if we're ever to persuade
                            the Arabs that Israel won't just do what we tell it. It may be that the
                            best help <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName> could give us
                            would be some strong words to the Conference of Presidents of major
                            Jewish organizations in New York and a modest endorsement in his
                            departure statement.</item>

                            <hi rend="italic">Balance of payments</hi>. Israeli reserves are about
                            $720 million. Of this, $45 million is in gold and about $600 million in
                            dollar holdings. Last year, they put about $200 million in long-term
                            dollar securities. They expect reserves to decline this year by maybe
                            $100 million, largely because of lower remittances from the US. They
                            hesitate to put more of their reserves into long-term dollar holdings
                            because of their war chest psychology and consequent concern for
                            liquidity. Nevertheless, <pb n="65" xml:id="pg_65" facs="0093"/>once
                            you've thanked him for past help, Secretary Fowler thinks it would be
                            reasonable to suggest that he put another $100 million into long-term
                            holdings plus an amount equal to any increase in their reserves. We can
                            assure them we'd make these liquid if they really needed cash.</item>

                                <hi rend="italic">Aircraft</hi>. To keep the Skyhawk production line
                                going, we have to decide soon, and I think we should give a <hi
                                    rend="italic">secret</hi> go-ahead on the 27 additional
                                Skyhawks. The 48 already being delivered will replace Israel's war
                                losses, and the extra 27 would bring inventory to about 225 (pre-war
                                200) even if France delivers nothing. The real issue is the 50
                                Phantoms because that's what the Israelis really want and it is so
                                clearly superior to anything the Arabs have that it would introduce
                                a significantly advanced weapon into the area. (You might be
                                interested in reading the comparison of these two planes and Soviet
                                aircraft in the briefing book at the red tab under Background Tab
                                A.)</p>
                            <p>I suggest saying we will amend the present <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Skyhawk</hi> agreement to add 27. We will deliver as quickly as
                                the production line permits. (At present view, the most compressed
                                plan would deliver the first plane in May 1969 and complete delivery
                                in March 1970.) We would like to make this a cash sale (about $32
                                million) but could consider credit if they press. We must hold off
                                the <hi rend="italic">Phantom</hi> decision for another few months
                                until we have a clearer picture of Soviet and French policy and of
                                    <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>'s progress. But
                                you can assure <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName> that we
                                would not delay one day if we thought it would jeopardize
                                Israel.</p>
                            <p>The crucial point is how we satisfy <persName corresp="#p_EL1"
                                    >Eshkol</persName> that delay in our decision will not delay
                                their acquisition because of lead-time if we decide to go ahead. One
                                possibility is to offer to divert from our own production if the
                                Arab strength increases unexpectedly. Another proposal which
                                    <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName> may put to you is
                                for us to let the Israelis (a) begin engineering discussions with
                                the manufacturer to decide on the configuration they might want and
                                (b) even finance some long lead-time items with no commitment from
                                us on our ultimate decision. We had actually been considering
                                financing these items ourselves. Letting the Israelis do it would
                                unquestionably make it harder for us not to sell later.</p>

                                <hi rend="italic">Desalting</hi>. We are not ready to make a
                                decision. What we know now is that the project as originally planned
                                (100 million gallons per day water, 200 megawatts electricity) would
                                cost about $216 million. The Israelis have since considered two
                                larger plans-one to increase electrical output to 300 megawatts for
                                $224 million and a second to increase electrical capacity to 350
                                megawatts and water output to 175 MGD for $336 million. For the $336
                                million plant, there would be a gap of about $150 million that would
                                need to come from “soft” (30 years, 2% or less) loans even if the
                                Israelis paid $84 million in local costs, the <pb n="66"

                            <p>We suggest you discuss frankly with <persName corresp="#p_EL1"
                                    >Eshkol</persName> the substantial financial gap and then try to
                                get some sense of how much Israel is willing to put in and how
                                willing <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName> is to integrate
                                this into a regional system (apart from just watering Gaza, which he
                                probably hopes to keep).</p>
                            <p>The one concrete step we can take at this stage would be to appoint a

                            <hi rend="italic"> PL 480.</hi> The Israelis have asked for about $32
                            million in wheat, feedgrains, tobacco and vegetable oil. This is larger
                            than last year's $27 million program because the Israelis took no wheat
                            when we were tight. State has some reservations about a larger program
                            which could be interpreted as our support for Israeli conquests, but I
                            think the difference is narrow enough to be manageable. If you wish, you
                            can simply say we can do at least as much as last year.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>The other issue is that the Israelis will want at least the 50/50 split
                        between local currency and dollar purchases. Treasury and Budget argue
                        rightly that there is no economic justification—given our aid criteria—for
                        this not to be a 100% dollar sale. I believe we have to keep moving toward
                        100% to meet Congressional requirements, but I think you could get away with
                        a 75% dollar sale this year if you want. You may not want to be this
                        specific with <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName>, but you might
                        avoid later misunderstanding by mentioning the problem.</p>

                    <p>1310. 1. I was received by <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> at
                        his residence at 12:30 <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> today (Jan 6).
                        Conversation lasted forty minutes. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                            >Nasser</persName> seemed in excellent health and good spirits. He was
                        clad in sweater and slacks. There were no manifestations of his nervous
                        habits, such as knee-jiggling or finger-cracking although he still has his
                        little giggle. He was friendly and cordial throughout, making usual
                        inquiries about family, etc. 2. I referred to <persName>Birdsall</persName>
                        visit to Cairo Dec 9, Birdsall's return to US and his being received by
                        President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> Dec 18. I then
                        handed text of letter from President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1"
                            >Johnson</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
                        which he carefully read.<note n="2" xml:id="d34fn2">See <ref target="#d31"
                                >Document 31</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>3. I then stated that in addition to delivering letter from <persName
                            corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> to President <persName
                            corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>, <persName>Birdsall</persName> had
                        also passed an oral message.<note n="3" xml:id="d34fn3">

                            >21</ref>.</note> I then reviewed five points set forth in para 2 State

                            <ref target="#d31">Document 31</ref>.</note>
                        <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s eyes got bigger and bigger
                        as I read this. I said one of main reasons why I had asked to see him
                        personally was that we were not sure how much of these five points had been
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> and how much
                            <persName>Birdsall</persName>. This got a big laugh from <persName
                            corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>.</p>
                    <p>4. I then slowly and carefully read out President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1"
                            >Johnson</persName>'s verbal message to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                            >Nasser</persName>. He listened attentively after which I handed him
                        aide-memoire summarizing substance of verbal message.</p>
                    <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> began his remarks by asking
                        me who was <persName>Birdsall</persName> (whom he calls Birdswell) and who
                        was Saddiqi. I gave as much biographic data as I could, emphasizing fact
                        that Mr. <persName>Birdsall</persName> and his associates had no connection
                        whatsoever with <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>. <persName
                            corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> said he had come to conclusion that
                            <persName>Birdsall</persName> was a purely unofficial emissary. Since
                            <persName>Birdsall</persName> visit Dec 9, tentative arrangements had
                        been made at Birdsall's request to receive him in Cairo again on Jan 4.
                        However, <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> had subsequently
                        heard from <persName>Birdsall</persName> that response to his messages to
                        President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> would be coming
                        through another channel.</p>
                    <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> then, using aide-memoire
                        based on verbal message as text, went over it and commented on a number of
                        its points.</p>
                    <pb n="68" xml:id="pg_68" facs="0096"/>
                    <p>7. First of all, he said he had made no requests through Mr.
                            <persName>Birdsall</persName>. He had told <persName>Birdsall</persName>
                        that he did not believe there was any direct conflict between the United
                        States and the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and that the <gloss
                            target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> had good intentions toward the US. There
                        were, however, a number of “indirect questions” which troubled US-<gloss
                            target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> relations.</p>
                    <p>8. As to diplomatic relations, <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
                        said he had told <persName>Birdsall</persName> that their resumption would
                        be to the mutual interest but this would take time despite the fact that
                        there were good intentions on both sides. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                            >Nasser</persName> was pleased at steps recently taken to improve the
                        atmosphere in US-<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> relations. He mentioned
                        specifically the return of American personnel, the American University at
                        Cairo, and the prospective return of the Ford Foundation.</p>
                    <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> then went into the question
                        of charges of US military participation in June war. He mentioned he was
                        aware of suggestion I had made to Vice President Mohieddin last October that
                        Heykal publish denial in <hi rend="italic"> El Ahram</hi>. When Mohieddin
                        had conveyed this suggestion to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                            >Nasser</persName>, latter had said, “What is there to deny?” <persName
                            corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> went on to say that apart from what
                        may have appeared in the newspapers, there had never been any official
                        declaration that US aircraft had taken part in the attack on the <gloss
                            target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. He said he had been asked by his own high
                        command at noon on June 5 to issue statement that US and British aircraft
                        were participating. He had told high command that he would not make such a
                        statement until they could produce American pilot or plane. He then reviewed
                        history of telephone call with <persName>Hussein</persName>, etc., and said
                        he had only quoted what <persName>Hussein</persName> had told him. He noted
                        that <persName>Hussein</persName> had since retracted. He therefore felt
                        that question was being exaggerated and that one should make distinction
                        between what was said officially and what appeared in the papers so far as
                        direct US assistance to Israel was concerned. He went on to state that there
                        remained the question of “indirect participation” of the United States in
                        that the US had given Israel considerable quantities of arms and money.</p>
                    <p>10. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> then moved on to para B of
                        verbal message, saying <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> had made clear
                        its policy re Arab-Israel settlement. If Israel willing to withdraw, <gloss
                            target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> willing to accept state of
                        non-belligerency. If Israel unwilling to withdraw, then it not only
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s policy but his duty to
                        liberate Egyptian territory occupied by Israel. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                            >Nasser</persName> asked if his <gloss target="#t_FonOff1"
                            >FonOff</gloss> had shown me <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName>
                        letter to <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>. I replied
                        affirmatively. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> said he took
                        this message as indication Israelis “were not very serious.” As to the Suez
                        Canal, <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> said it was well known
                        that this issue was linked to the question of justice to the Palestinian
                        refugees.</p>
                    <p>11. On para D of verbal message, <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                            >Nasser</persName> disclaimed any request that the US make a special
                        gesture towards the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> or the Arabs
                        generally. He said that he had told <persName>Birdsall</persName> his
                        feeling that the US stand at the United Nations had been one hundred percent
                        in favor of Israel. <pb n="69" xml:id="pg_69" facs="0097"/>He had told
                            <persName>Birdsall</persName> that he did not want economic aid from the
                        United States, he wanted justice. He repeated to me now that that was still
                        his position. He preferred justice to aid. He referred favorably in this
                        connection to statements made by President Kennedy to effect US would oppose
                        aggression from any quarter in the Middle East.</p>
                    <p>12. As to British Security Council resolution,<note n="5" xml:id="d34fn5">See
                                <ref target="#d1fn3">footnote 3, Document 1</ref>.</note>
                        <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> recalled that his government
                        had asked through me for assurances of US support for this resolution.<gloss

                            >USG</gloss> assurances and celerity with which they had been given.</p>
                    <p>13. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> then dwelt at some length
                        on second half of para D of verbal message where it refers to “new period of
                        friendship based on trust” and “tragic suspicions.” On “tragic suspicions”
                        he referred to his 1966 conversation with <persName>Birdsall</persName>
                        which he said was based largely on suspicions created by Mustapha Amin
                        affair. At this point I interposed that I had spent over five years of my
                        life directly concerned with improvement and strengthening of US-<gloss
                            target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> relations. I felt that dark suspicions were
                        perhaps the major obstacle. I had discussed this many times with his
                        associate and my good friend, Hassan Sabri El Kholi, and urged that whenever
                        suspicions arose, we should talk them out together fully and frankly.
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> made approving but
                        noncommittal noises. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> then went
                        on to say, “If I told you that it was now possible to move into a new period
                        of friendship based on trust, I would not be myself. It is impossible for me
                        to say that as of today I now have full confidence and trust in US
                        Government. I think we can get these but it needs time. We must work
                        together to build confidence.”</p>
                    <p>14. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> denied that he had asked
                            <persName>Birdsall</persName> to tell President <persName
                            corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                            >Nasser</persName> would like to visit the US. It had been
                            <persName>Birdsall</persName> who raised this point. He said, “Of
                        course, I would like to visit the United States but I know that it would be
                        impossible in the absence of diplomatic relations between us.”</p>
                    <p>15. At this point I said that my government would not agree with some of the
                        statements of substance which President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                            >Nasser</persName> had made. I had discussed these issues at length,
                        however, with members of his government and I was sure that he was aware of
                        our viewpoint. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> said he
                        was.</p>
                    <p>16. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> then turned to President
                            <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s written message to him.
                        He said he would like to thank the President for this letter and to express
                        all his best wishes to the President and his family. He hoped we could work
                        for better relations between the two countries based on trust and
                        confidence. He also hoped we could work for the resumption <pb n="70"
                            xml:id="pg_70" facs="0098"/>of diplomatic relations which might take
                        some time. He thanked the President also for his verbal message.</p>
                    <p>17. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> said he was always prepared
                        to discuss any question with which the United States wished to deal and that
                        he was “ready to receive Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BDC1">Bergus</persName>
                        at any time the United States Government so desired.”</p>

                    <p>CAP 80151. We sent to you in the pouch early this morning two late memos on
                            <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName> from Dick Helms<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d35fn2">The <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> memoranda, both
                            dated January 5, have subject lines that read: “Agency Views Regarding
                            the Political Future of <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName>”
                                [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>]. (Ibid.)</note>
                        without comment. After reflecting on them this morning, I find that they
                        bring the following points into sharper focus: <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>More than just seeking a specific number of aircraft, <persName
                                    corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName> may be looking for a firmer
                                commitment to Israel's security. He must understand that security
                                guarantees and treaties are out, but he may seek a guaranteed source
                                of arms. According to Dick's plausible report, the June war
                                destroyed <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName>'s policy of
                                putting out as many support lines as possible. His French and
                                Russian policies are bankrupt, and he now seeks the closest possible
                                tie with us.</item>
                            <pb n="71" xml:id="pg_71" facs="0099"/>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>To seal this relationship, he may come offering to associate
                                Israel with our position in Vietnam.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>He is apparently willing to acquiesce in our resuming military aid
                                to Jordan. To do otherwise would be inconsistent with his increased

                        </list>
                    </p>
                    <p>If this report is true—and we have to make the normal allowance for the fact
                        that it reflects only one [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text
                            not declassified</hi>] man's opinion—it raises the problem of <persName
                            corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName> trying to get too close to us. His
                        possible offer to associate with us on Vietnam runs the risk of sharpening
                        the image of Israel as our stooge and driving the wedge further between us
                        and the Arabs. We want to consider whether <persName corresp="#p_EL1"
                            >Eshkol</persName>'s quiet support wouldn't help you as much while
                        avoiding damage abroad.</p>
                    <p>It's hard to know how much the Israelis are pushing the Soviet threat merely
                        to justify their case for more arms.</p>

                                    >Eshkol</persName> to take back to his Cabinet in the light of

                    <p>It is our conclusion after a lengthy discussion that the security of Israel
                        cannot be assured by military hardware alone but must involve an arrangement
                        for peaceful existence with the Arab states.</p>
                    <p>In addition, Soviet penetration of the area cannot be limited by the
                        provision of military hardware alone but necessitates that Israel finds some
                        means of establishing a basis for peace beginning as soon as possible with a
                        step of encouragement to the moderate Arabs in their contest with extremist
                        Arab states.</p>
                    <p>We concur, after having reviewed the situation, with the recommendation of

                                >Rusk</persName>'s January 5 memorandum to the President listed
                            suggested talking points. Pages 5 and 6 suggested that in discussing the
                            Israeli arms request the President might want to say, in addition to the
                            sentence quoted in <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s
                            memorandum that the United States would be prepared to amend the Skyhawk
                            agreement to include an additional 27 aircraft, that the Israeli request
                            for F-4 fighters would be kept under review, and that if the U.S.
                            position changed in the months ahead, an effort would be made to be
                            helpful with regard to lead time.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>We emphasize the important first sentence of the recommendations which states
                        “we are prepared to see that Israel receives weapons needed to defend
                        itself, but must avoid arms shipments not warranted by the actual threat.”
                        In addition to the points made in the paper, we would like to add, on the
                        basis of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s
                        assurances, that the lead time for the delivery of F-4 Phantom aircraft
                        could be shortened to twelve months or less rather than the twenty-four
                        months which we assume the Israelis contemplate. The delivery of fifty such
                            <pb n="73" xml:id="pg_73" facs="0101"/>planes could be made without
                        serious problems to United States needs based on any situation presently
                        foreseeable once the decision is made by the United States to provide the
                        planes.</p>
                    <p>We would like to point out that it is highly desirable to avoid a total
                        polarization of the area with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        lending full support to an Arab world led by extremists against an Israel
                        with qualified American support.</p>
                    <p>The United States should continue to avoid being cast in the role of
                        principal supplier of arms to any country in the area. Until such time as an
                        understanding with respect to arms limitations in the area is reached, we
                        consider it essential that there be, to the maximum extent possible, a
                        diversity of suppliers.</p>
                    <p>We continue to be concerned about the situation with respect to Jordan. A
                        Russian mission including military experts will arrive in Amman on January 9
                        and undoubtedly a new offer of Soviet arms will be made to King
                            <persName>Hussein</persName> who is increasingly despondent with respect
                        to his relations with us particularly in connection with arms supplies.
                        Moreover, the King will be attending, as presently planned, the Arab Summit
                        meeting beginning on January 17 when the pressure will be very strong from
                        the radical Arab countries for him to accept Soviet arms in the absence of a
                        United States willingness to continue its traditional role. An arrangement
                        with the Russians could have attractions from a financial point of view
                        given the likelihood that the United Arab Command can arrange financing
                        through Soviet channels for Jordanian purchases, possibly without cost to
                        the Jordanians.</p>
                    <p>If the response to King <persName>Hussein</persName> is to have the maximum
                        effectiveness, it should be made prior to the arrival of Prime Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName> to avoid the charge that
                        will be leveled at the King that the minimum equipment to be released to him
                        grew out of an understanding reached at that meeting and with Prime Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName>'s concurrence. We therefore
                        recommend that you act favorably, if possible today, on the telegram before

                    <p>In response to your request of yesterday, here is my assessment of the threat
                        Israel faces, Israel's aircraft requirements, and my recommendations with
                        respect to the Israeli request for A-4 and F-4 aircraft.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>Air superiority is crucial to military success in the Arab-Israeli
                        environment. Israel knows this, and assumes the Arabs have learned this
                        lesson. General <persName corresp="#p_WBGE1">Weizman</persName>, Israeli Air
                        Force, argued here last September that the Arabs are acquiring more and
                        better aircraft from the Soviet Union, and will continue to do so into the
                        1970s; that they will now be providing better protection for aircraft at
                        existing airfields and will be building new airfields and improving
                        techniques and training; and that the Arab states will now cooperate more
                        efficiently in their military and political efforts against Israel. Israeli
                        representatives continue to press these points. <persName corresp="#p_WBGE1"
                            >Weizman</persName> concluded that Israel needs additional versatile
                        aircraft in order to confront successfully a growing Arab capability, and
                        also to make up Israeli war losses (43 combat aircraft) and to replace
                        certain of Israel's order aircraft. <persName corresp="#p_WBGE1"
                            >Weizman</persName> projected an air force of 250 combat aircraft by the
                        end of 1968 and 350 aircraft in the early 1970s. (Comparisons of
                        Arab-Israeli aircraft capabilities and inventories are attached.)</p>
                    <p>We agree, by and large, with the Israeli data on current Arab air inventories
                        and on post-war Soviet resupply. And although uncertain, the Israeli
                        numerical projections of Arab (including Algeria and Saudi Arabia)
                        inventories for 1970, totaling 924 aircraft, appear reasonable. The number
                        of aircraft in Arab inventories has never been, however, the principal
                        factor in the Arab-Israeli military equation. Israel always <pb n="76"
                            xml:id="pg_76" facs="0104"/>has been numerically inferior. But despite
                        their large numbers of aircraft, the Arabs have never been able to maintain
                        or use these effectively; thus the numbers of aircraft which can be brought
                        to bear effectively against Israel is much smaller than the totals of their
                        inventories. The offensive (attack) capabilities of the Arab aircraft are
                        limited, and considerably inferior to those of Israel. Also, not every Arab
                        state is militarily relevant to the conflict. Saudi Arabia, Iraq and
                        Algeria, for example, cannot bring effective power to bear against Israel.
                        The decisive factor is the superior overall quality in the maintenance,
                        command and control, training, equipment and, especially, personnel of
                        Israel. Their training, organization, technical competence, and will to
                        fight is far superior to the Arabs. This will remain so for the foreseeable
                        future. Although Arab aircraft losses will undoubtedly be fully replaced by
                        the Soviets in coming months, the Arab military forces were decimated and
                        their morale shattered; it will take them a number of years to exceed their
                        pre-war capabilities. Arab territorial losses will make it more difficult in
                        the future to conduct air or ground operations against Israel-the Sinai will
                        surely be demilitarized, even if returned to Egypt.</p>
                    <p>In sum, the Israeli military position has improved markedly since 4 June. I
                        am sure that the Arabs will learn some lessons from the recent conflict, and
                        that there will be improvements in Arab air forces. They have shown some
                        modest evidence of this already. They are unlikely, however, to make
                        dramatic gains. And Israel's air force is itself improving: the supply of 48
                        A-4H aircraft is underway, and we have recommended to you the sale of an
                        additional 27 A-4s. Israel would thus be adding over the next 18-24 months
                        at least 75 new attack aircraft to its inventory, more than overcoming,
                        quantitatively and qualitatively, Israel's June losses. Israel will have by
                        the end of 1969, an inventory of over 225 combat aircraft. I believe this is
                        presently adequate for Israel to maintain its security. The Joint Chiefs
                        have stated: “The Israeli capability to prevail in any renewal of
                        hostilities, even without the Mirages, is considered assured for at least
                        the next 18 months. Release of the 27 additional A-4s would further raise
                        this level of assurance.”</p>
                    <p>Further, although the delivery of the 50 new French Mirage V remains
                        uncertain, there is a reasonable possibility that France will deliver these
                        as earlier promised. Israel would then be able to phase out some older
                        aircraft, and have an air force clearly superior to the Arabs. This would
                        preserve Israel's margin of superiority into the 1970s without further
                        aircraft from us. Israel further hopes to buy or fabricate 100 F-1 French
                        aircraft when this airplane is produced (1972-4).</p>

                        Delivery was to be in Israel in flyable condition, commencing with four in
                        December 1967 (which have been delivered), and completed by December 1968.
                        These terms and delivery schedules are being adhered to. The agreement was
                        to be secret. The Israelis agreed to look primarily to Europe for arms and
                        noted our expectation that they would request no additional US military
                        aircraft for at least five years.</p>
                    <p>Israel now wishes 27 additional A-4H Skyhawks and I recommend we accede to
                        this request. To minimize the possible impact, we propose to amend the 1966
                        agreement to increase the number sold by 27 (for a total of 75 A-4H's). We
                        prefer to sell these for cash. Military sales credit funds have been sharply
                        curtailed and Israel's financial position permits a straight cash sale. If
                        some credit seems desirable, however, we suggest offering to finance up to
                        $20 million of the A-4H program (which will probably total between $30 and
                        $35 million for the 27 aircraft plus support) at 5-1/2 per cent interest. If
                        necessary, we could finance the whole sale, but at the cost of reducing the
                        credit available for other sales, including any for Israel.</p>
                    <p>Delivery of the additional 27 A-4H's cannot start before June 1969. This is
                        because certain components peculiar to the Israeli version of the A-4 have a
                        long production leadtime. Delivery would be completed in April 1970 under
                        normal conditions. We could shorten this to December, 1969 without much
                        difficulty, by diverting from U.S. military requirements.</p>
                    <p>The Israelis have repeatedly pressed for speedier delivery of the 48 Skyhawks
                        ordered in 1966 and will surely urge quick delivery of the additional 27.
                        The present schedule for delivery of the 48 A-4H's by the end of CY 1968
                        cannot be expedited without curtailing production for Navy requirements;
                        even by diversion, delivery could not be completed until September, 1968,
                        only three months ahead of schedule.</p>
                    <p>More importantly, the least costly and most efficient way to meet Israel's
                        request for the 27 additional A-4H's, is to delay the delivery of the last
                        of the aircraft in the existing order of 48 until the production of the
                        additional 27 can begin, thereby preventing a break in the production
                        line.</p>
                    <pb n="78" xml:id="pg_78" facs="0106"/>
                    <p>We could deliver F-4 aircraft to Israel beginning 24 months from date of
                        contract, provided Israel did not want extensive modifications made to the
                        aircraft or on maintenance and support procedures. This would be the normal
                        delivery. If necessary we could, by diversion from U.S. force requirements,
                        deliver F-4's to Israel in 12 months.</p>
                    <p>Israel is arguing that the production leadtime of 24 months or longer from
                        decision to first deliveries of F-4's, coupled with the uncertainties about
                        Soviet/Arab and French intentions, requires some positive decision now. The
                        Israeli Defense Attache has proposed that we at least agree to undertake
                        joint engineering studies on possible configuration changes and permit
                        Israel to finance advance procurement of long leadtime components.</p>
                    <p>There are persuasive arguments against the sale, or even the promise of a
                        future sale, of the F-4. The history of the Arab-Israeli arms race is a long
                        one. The Arabs (particularly Egypt) and the Israelis have competed with one
                        another, at very high cost, in maintaining modern armaments. The acquisition
                        of a superior aircraft by one has stimulated the other to acquire a yet more
                        superior airplane. The F-4 would clearly be the most sophisticated aircraft
                        in the Middle East and its delivery there would risk the beginning of still
                        another cycle in the arms race, contrary to your June 19 call for an end to
                        the arms race.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Union hastily replaced most Arab aircraft losses from the June war
                        but these aircraft losses have not been fully overcome, and Soviet supply
                        activities have returned to their pre-war level. The supply of F-4's to
                        Israel would cause a sharp reaction from the Arabs and may bring
                        irresistible pressures on the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to
                        supply more, or more sophisticated, aircraft to them.</p>
                    <p>F-4 aircraft are not militarily required by Israel to assure its security.
                        Although Soviet and French intentions, and the speed with which the Arabs
                        can overcome their considerable military disabilities, remain uncertain and
                        require close and constant scrutiny, there are no indications that Israel's
                        advantageous security position will be upset for the foreseeable future.
                        Should conditions change, we are able to deliver F-4's to Israel from new
                        production within 24 months, even 12 months if we divert from U.S. force
                        requirements. There is no need at this time, as has been suggested by
                        Israel, to insure our ability to deliver these aircraft quickly by advance
                        procurement of long leadtime items. (We could, if necessary, use our own
                        funds to buy these items, without informing Israel, and reduce the leadtime
                        to about 18 months.)</p>
                    <p>Finally, it is my view that implicit or explicit agreements now for the sale
                        of these aircraft may jeopardize the <persName corresp="#p_JG1"

                    </p>
                    <p>I recommend you approve the sale of 27 additional A-4H aircraft, preferably
                        for cash but, if desirable, for credit at 5-1/2 per cent with amounts and
                        terms to be subsequently determined, and with the important condition that
                        the transaction be kept secret until the United States determines
                        otherwise.</p>
                    <p>I recommend against expedited delivery of any of the A-4H aircraft and
                        recommend that you refer any questions about this subject to me. I will,
                        with your approval, discuss this subject with <persName corresp="#p_EL1"

                    <p>I recommend against any commitment to sell, or to buy long leadtime items in
                        anticipation of a future sale, of F-4 Phantom aircraft. I suggest you assure
                        the Prime Minister that we will follow closely the activities of the Soviets
                        and the French supply policies. We will continue to scrutinize the situation
                        in the coming months. You may assure the Prime Minister that, if significant
                        changes require it, we could deliver the F-4 promptly—if necessary, as soon
                        as Israel would receive them if we made an agreement today.</p>

                    <p>After an exchange of pleasantries, the Prime Minister read an opening
                        statement as follows:</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft">“Mr. President:</p>
                    <p>“Before discussing the main purpose of my mission, I want to express my
                        appreciation for many things which happened in the first week of June and in
                        the political arena since then. Having met you in 1964, your emphatic stand
                        and principles during 1967 on matters of the most fundamental importance to
                        the existence and security of my country are engraved for all time on the
                        tablets of Jewish memory and indeed world history.</p>
                    <p>“The heart of my mission is how can we build peace in the Middle East between
                        the Arab States and Israel. This matter occupies my attention throughout.
                        May I touch on it from three angles: <list>

                        <item>“1. The Six Day war may have possibly, for the first time, stirred in
                            the Middle East the beginnings of a process leading to peace.</item>
                        <item>“2. The world community accepted that there can be no return to the
                            conditions which gave the Arabs strategic and other possibilities of
                            aggression.</item>
                        <item>“3. Regretfully the Egyptian and Syrian armies are being rebuilt at a
                            menacing rate under Soviet guidance as their leaders contemplate the
                            possibility of renewing hostilities.</item>
                        <item>“However there are signs of other views. There are those who ask
                            whether war will not lead to new Arab disasters; there are those who are
                            sitting on the fence; there are those, here and there, who may even be
                            thinking in their heart of hearts of peace. In this situation, the
                            essential first contribution towards peace is to block the road to
                            war.</item>
                        <item>“4. Our policy is direct negotiations leading to peace treaties. We
                            take this line not because of any obstinate adhesion to any particular
                            formula but because we believe that face-to-face contact and reasoning
                            together will create a new psychological reality. Without that, as we
                            have learned for twenty years through bitter experience and as you
                            yourself have noted, any other arrangement has no validity.</item>

                            mission. In talks with him in Jerusalem, we have made several gestures
                            to help him. Firstly, we have given him two agendas—one for Cairo and
                            one for Amman—which contain suggestions for the subjects to be discussed
                            at any direct meeting. Secondly, we have told him that we will agree
                            that he should preside over a meeting of the two sides to discuss the
                            agendas for negotiations and to define the issues. Thirdly, all contact
                            at this stage can be secret including such a meeting. In order to create
                            a better atmosphere, we have agreed that foreign ships at present in the
                            Bitter Lake can be taken out through an arrangement with General
                                <persName corresp="#p_BLGO1">Bull</persName> within the framework of
                            our existing agreements on the ceasefire. We have also made a gesture in
                            returning an additional 500 Egyptian prisoners of war without
                            reciprocation. We shall continue to facilitate <persName

                            context this is a question that can and should be solved and we will
                            make our contribution.</item>
                        <item>“7. We are doing everything possible to restore the situation on the

                            are investing at least $30 million in order to develop the economy and
                            provide employment for the local population including the

                    <p>“In order to stimulate the beginnings of more moderate trends in the Arab
                        world, two factors are crucial. With your permission, I will touch on these
                        two aspects in some detail:</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft">“<hi rend="italic">B. The Question of the Arms Race</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>“Three of the Arab countries whose forces were engaged in hostilities against
                        us in June—Egypt, Syria and Iraq, had in November combined forces of 460
                        fighters and 47 bombers, or a total of over 500 planes. Egypt alone had over
                        80% of its June strength and I believe that by now it is nearly back to its
                        June strength. From now on continued Russian supply may be an increase of
                        the pre-June strength. These figures do not take into account countries like
                        Algeria which supplied planes to Egypt in June and its air strength is over
                        100-150 planes.</p>
                    <p>“In tanks the Egyptians are steadily progressing towards their pre-war
                        position. Egyptian navy is stronger than in June with special emphasis on
                        rocket-equipped naval craft. The Egyptians are planning an overall increase
                        of their land forces as against June.</p>
                    <p>“We have every ground to suppose that Russia has introduced ground-to-ground
                        rockets into Egypt.</p>
                    <p>“The quality of Egyptian planes is much superior to what it was in June.</p>
                    <pb n="82" xml:id="pg_82" facs="0110"/>
                    <p>“The Egyptian air force is now deployed with a view to increasing the safety
                        of aircraft.</p>
                    <p>“Continuous and vast efforts to improve training of Egyptian armed forces
                        under Soviet guidance. We assess at least 2,500 Soviet military experts are
                        in Egypt.</p>
                    <p>“<hi rend="italic">Our Situation:</hi> At most we have 150 planes of which at
                        least 25 Mysteres and 41 Ouragens are out of date.</p>
                    <p>“50 additional French Mirages to Israel are very doubtful. Even if DeGaulle
                        will deliver, he will balance it with planes to the Arabs.</p>
                    <p>“Even if we were to get the 50 Mirages and adding to that the 48 Skyhawks
                        from the U.S., we would not have vital minimum for 1968-69 nor the right mix
                        of planes. We ourselves will have to put out of service the Mysteres and
                        Ouragens. Thus we will be left with only 170 planes. The only plane which
                        has necessary range, defensive capacity and versatility to face up to the
                        new situation is the Phantom. We need of course the additional Skyhawks we
                        have asked for but we cannot have minimum security unless we get Phantoms.
                        All my military advisers, without exception, are unanimous on
                        indispensability of the Phantom.</p>
                    <p>“Unless the Arabs know that we have necessary defensive capacity, the
                        tendency to renew hostilities will be strengthened and peace possibilities
                        heavily prejudiced. Israel is extremely vulnerable. One defeat in field—can
                        be fatal for our survival.</p>
                    <p>“We need 50 Phantoms as rapidly as possible.</p>
                    <p>“Over the years, I think that you and I are agreed that we must avoid a
                        situation where Israel will not be able to meet aggression by its forces
                        alone. The one effective way of assuring this and of interpreting the
                        continuous American concern for Israel's security which I so deeply
                        appreciate, is by translating this commitment into making the necessary arms
                        available for us.</p>
                    <p>“What I ask from you is the minimum. I cannot take risks with the security of
                        my country. This means that crucially we must have Phantoms and then
                        Skyhawks.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft">“<hi rend="italic">C. Soviet Policy and Penetration</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>“We believe that your historic action in warning the Soviets in June ‘hands
                        off’ influenced them away from any thought of active intervention.</p>
                    <p>“What has happened in Yemen gives apprehension that they may wish in certain
                        eventualities to provide indirect support to Arab aggressive forces. We know
                        of your concern in this respect.</p>
                    <p>“We believe that the Six-Day War blocked the taking over of the Middle East
                        by the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <pb n="83" xml:id="pg_83" facs="0111"/>
                    <p>“Side by side with giving us the necessary planes, we think it is crucial
                        that the Soviet Union know that the U.S. will not tolerate any Soviet
                        military intervention in the area direct or indirect.</p>
                    <p>“This has been U.S. policy since 1946 and received Congressional affirmation
                        in 1957, in the passage of which you, Mr. President, played a central
                        role.</p>
                    <p>“I would submit that this position be re-affirmed in the clearest terms.</p>
                    <p>“To sum up, then, we believe the course of peace can be enhanced in the area
                        if the U.S. and other nations support direct negotiations leading to peace,
                        if Israel has the necessary military deterrent capacity and if the Soviets
                        are effectively warned that no unilateral intervention, direct or indirect,
                        will be tolerated.</p>
                    <p>“Mr. President, I have no sense of boastful triumph nor have I entered the
                        struggle for peace in the role of victor. My feeling is one of relief that
                        we were saved from disaster in June and for this I thank God. All my
                        thoughts now are turned towards getting peace with our neighbors—a peace of
                        honor between equals.”</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister then added that military experts had predicted that Israel
                        would win. It is, however, difficult to be precise. If Israel had waited one
                        day more, the outcome might have been different. Israel must live in the
                        Middle East for centuries ahead. It will do all possible to live there
                        peacefully. It needs tools, however, to assure the peace. He regretted that
                        the U.S. was the only source of these tools. It was an “either/or
                        situation”. Either the U.S. must provide the arms or leave Israel to its
                        fate. The Arabs would know that the Americans and the French had said “No”.
                        Even if France gave 50 planes, it would not be enough. Israel needs 350
                        first-rate planes. By 1970 the Arabs will have 900 planes. The Israelis
                        plead for help.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> said that he was
                        impressed with the statement made by the Prime Minister. The U.S. is
                        intensely concerned with conditions in the Middle East. It is encouraging to
                        know that the Prime Minister had his thoughts turned to peace with honor.
                        This subject takes most of the President's day, although not entirely with
                        respect to the Middle East. We have, however, had other serious situations
                        in the Middle East such as Cyprus. We have a difficult situation in
                        Southeast Asia calling on our resources. Now we have a difficult balance of
                        payments problem. If possible, we are as concerned to bring peace in the
                        Middle East as are the Israelis. The U.S. wishes to work with Israel in any
                        way possible, and we believe we have shown that. Since June, the U.S. has
                        ascertained what is most likely to lead to peace in the area in line with
                        President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s five points to
                        permit 2-1/2 million Jews to live in harmony with many millions of Arabs. We
                        have made it clear <pb n="84" xml:id="pg_84" facs="0112"/>to the world that
                        we do not believe might makes right nor that big nations should be permitted
                        to swallow up little nations. We will resist aggression whether it be
                        Hitler, <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, or Israel. Other
                        discussions between our countries have dealt with other problems we face,
                        including the difficulties in the Congress with respect to the supply of
                        arms to various parts of the world. The conflict between India and Pakistan
                        where we found ourselves providing arms to both sides of a conflict had had
                        an impact on our Congress of serious proportions. This is not a country
                        where there is one-man rule. The Church amendments, the defeat on the aid
                        bill, all underlined the difficulty we had with the Congress with respect to
                        military assistance programs. The President wished to remind the Israelis
                        that when agreement was reached for the 48 Skyhawks, it was agreed that
                        Israel would look elsewhere for equipment beyond that covered by that
                        understanding.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister interjected here that the Israelis would be delighted to
                        look elsewhere if we would “give them an address.”</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> said that the Prime
                        Minister had to be guided by the best military advice he could get. So does
                        the United States. What's before us is not a question of our not wanting to
                        see Israel secure although there might be differences as to what was
                        required to assure this security. The President reviewed other defense
                        arrangements, pointing out that he had in the past gone somewhat above the
                        level of equipment recommended from a military point of view. He said that
                        in connection with the request for additional A-4's and the F-4's we had
                        reviewed the matter very carefully, and he had spent much time on this
                        subject. The President said that he regretted that the visit was so closely
                        tied to the request for Phantoms. There are much broader problems. Phantoms
                        won't determine security. Planes won't change things that basically. The big
                        problem is how 2-1/2 million Jews can live in a sea of Arabs. We searched
                        for a formula in the same way that we searched for a formula during the
                        Greek and Turkish problems over Cyprus and in Vietnam. But success can't be
                        measured by planes alone. What can be done to implement the five points?
                        This did not mean we were unsympathetic to the military requirements. We had
                        agreed to expedite the 48 Skyhawks, and we were sympathetic on other
                        requests since any loss of face by Israel would be a serious loss to us.
                        However, the President was being criticized for commitments he made, and he
                        must proceed slowly. He followed carefully Israel's military situation and
                        would not sit idly by and see Israel suffer. This had been made clear by act
                        and by deed. Tomorrow we would review with the military officials of the
                        U.S. the present military situation. At the moment, the President considered
                        it wise to review what steps could be taken toward peace with honor. Neither
                        the Israelis nor the Americans nor anyone else has done all <pb n="85"
                            xml:id="pg_85" facs="0113"/>that it should do toward peace, and we were
                        fearful of the consequences of inaction.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said that he could not
                        help comparing the situation to our problem with the Russians. The situation
                        growing out of arms races had now reached a situation potentially suicidal
                        for everybody. A finger on a button, and we are all finished. Someone on the
                        diplomatic side must be active to see what is possible in other than
                        military rounds. The Arabs could double any efforts the Israelis made in the
                        military field. How can we come to an arrangement in which Israel could live
                        in peace? The Arabs will not back down from the military race but will call
                        upon the Soviet Union for military help. However, by and large, the Arabs
                        have resisted the Soviet Union. If the Arabs see an Israel with which they
                        cannot live, they will turn increasingly to the Soviets. There is no way we
                        can stop penetration if the Arabs themselves decide that the situation is
                        intolerable. The territorial problem is central. We recognize that there are
                        no agreed boundaries. But the Soviets have made the territorial question the
                        central one in the General Assembly from the beginning and have not changed
                        their position on this point. With the passage of time, unless there is
                        movement, moderate voices will give way to radical voices; and penetration
                        will begin in a manner we cannot stop. We hope you can find it possible to
                        tell us what kind of Israel you want the Arabs to live with and the American
                        people to support. In June, there were discussions with the Congressional
                        leadership, and there was an almost unanimous view that the U.S. should
                        involve itself in the Middle East only in a multilateral framework. While we
                        recognize that Israel is impatient with the United Nations, this
                        organization still might offer the best hope. We are at an impasse in the
                        present situation in our talks with the Russians. Without movement, the
                        Russian position is strengthened in the Arab world and U.S. strength
                        diminishes. The danger cannot be resolved by hardware. Is it possible that
                        Israel could give signals more important than it has given so far? For
                        example, is there some possibility of a solution on the refugee problem?
                        Tiran Island is of no importance to Israel. Despite what Faisal says about
                        Israel, there is a common interest between the Israelis and the Saudis in
                        keeping the Soviet thrust in the area under control. Another possibility
                        concerns the Straits of Tiran. We understand there is no problem in the
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> with respect to the use of the
                        Straits. If the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> had said so on June 1,
                        there would have been no war. Could the Israelis, through the <persName
                            corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> mission, permit a U.N. force in
                        Sharm-el-Sheikh with a clear understanding that the Strait is an
                        international one? This costs nothing and removes the charge that the
                        Israelis intend to retain all territory presently held. It is difficult for
                        us to describe the Israelis the Arabs are expected to live with.</p>
                    <pb n="86" xml:id="pg_86" facs="0114"/>
                    <p>The Prime Minister said these were difficult remarks. Israel is not ready to
                        return to the Israel of June 4, the map of the former Israel. Israel did not
                        want war. It could have lived 50 to 100 years in the prior situation. Now
                        that the war has happened, however, it is impossible to return to the former
                        Israel. Israelis cannot accept a Suez Canal open to all the world except the
                        Israelis. The Prime Minister recalled the signs in Russia, “No Jews”. That
                        cannot be forgotten. When the issue had arisen in 1956, President Eisenhower
                        had said that there was no promise nor was there a treaty. Nevertheless,
                        President Eisenhower had said that the Government of Israel has a right to
                        the use of the Suez Canal. If <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
                        tries to interfere, President Eisenhower said he believed the international
                        family of nations will take a firm hand. The Israelis cannot live forever
                        with the feeling that they are untouchable. They have won the war. It is an
                        impossible situation not to find peace. With respect to Sharm-el-Sheikh,
                        perhaps this was negotiable. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1"
                            >Rusk</persName> had suggested that the guards be changed and the U.N.
                        permitted to take over. But what had the U.N. action of withdrawal caused
                        before? When <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> asked for
                        withdrawal of U.N. troops, the U.N. had said take Sharm-el-Sheikh as well.
                        Who can guarantee against a “welch” in two or three years.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said that the points
                        were valid. If the U.N. has a role, it must be very clear, and the Security
                        Council must be required to approve a change. This had been the missing
                        ingredient before. No one wants an end to the state of belligerency more
                        than President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> as has been
                        repeatedly evidenced. We had insisted in our discussions with the Russians
                        that free passage in waterways must be described in the plural, and the
                        Russians had understood that this included the Suez Canal and that the
                        matter cannot be dealt with by whim.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister said that the Israelis want to see a treaty of peace. It
                        is not enough that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> say there
                        is an end to belligerency, and perhaps he can admit that Israel exists.
                        After three wars, Israel deserves peace. Syria is ungovernable. It ignited
                        the war and probably is now willing to continue the terrorism of the past
                        with the hope that the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and other “big
                        brothers” will take care of the situation. The Israelis cannot live with
                        bazooka shots into villages and houses demolished. This is a last ditch
                        stand for the spirit of a nation—the Jewish spirit. This we believe in. It
                        is our history. We will try to be cooperative with <persName
                            corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>. However, Syria won't talk with him,
                        and <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> has not been forthcoming.
                        The Prime Minister said that he could not recommend after all that has
                        happened that there be another U.N. force. Given this history, the Israelis
                        put a low value on U.N. troops. While the Cabinet has not considered the
                        matter, he would now say that <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>
                        should try to bring us together with the Arabs and then leave us alone to
                        negotiate. We will try to be as forthcoming as possible, <pb n="87"
                            xml:id="pg_87" facs="0115"/>but we cannot go back. Israel could be
                        exterminated in one day. It will fight tooth and nail with tools, but it
                        must have those tools. There was some hope. Bourguiba had made helpful
                        statements. The attitude of the King of Morocco was known and acceptable.
                        Turkey and Ethiopia were all right. The Prime Minister said that he had
                        mentioned the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> but had not said that they
                        would or would not try to keep Sinai. There was no one with whom they could
                        discuss the matter. Israel wants security and simple human rights in Suez
                        and in the Straits of Tiran. It is difficult to know what is happening with
                        Jordan and with a King some people say is not stupid. Why would he get in
                        with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> whose cause was already
                        lost? The King had not lived up to the agreement that was made with respect
                        to the tanks which prohibited the tanks from crossing the river.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister said he was aware of our difficulties in the balance of
                        payments field, and Israel wished to help. The Government of Israel has $200
                        million in U.S. banks; and to lessen the burden on the U.S., he could see a
                        way which would double that amount on deposit in our banks, making it
                        roughly equal to gifts Israel receives. In this connection, he must point
                        out that the U.S. had encouraged Israel to spend dollars in France for
                        French Mirages. The Mirage is now as famous as beer from Milwaukee.</p>
                    <p>With respect to refugees, it has been apparent for some years that the
                        problem would not be difficult to solve if those concerned could talk like
                        friends. Agreements could be reached. Water in the Gaza strip could make a
                        great difference. For example, water would open new areas for settlement.
                        Iraq has land and could be told the world would help and the Israelis would
                        participate. All these problems need careful study.</p>
                    <p>At this point the meeting adjourned.</p>

                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> opened the meeting by
                        saying that while the President and the Prime Minister were talking
                            privately,<note n="2" xml:id="d40fn2">According to the President's Daily
                            Diary, <persName>Johnson</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_EL1"
                                >Eshkol</persName> met privately from 11:35 to 11:55 a.m.
                            (Ibid.)</note> it had been suggested that there be an assessment by
                        those present of the Russian input of arms into the Middle East and of the
                        ability of the Israelis to defend themselves.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> said that there was
                        no basic difference between U.S. and Israeli assessments of Soviet input or
                        of projections for the future in terms of hardware. Contrary to Israel's
                        opinions, however, the training, maintenance, command and control structure
                        of the Arab forces will not be as markedly successful as the Government of
                        Israel appears to think. The Arabs have a long way to go. Their maintenance
                        is bad; their morale is shaken. While they do have Soviet technicians, time
                        will be required for them to be effective. The Arabs have taken a tremendous
                        blow. Air and ground destruction has been great, but even more important is
                        the damage done to morale and organization.</p>
                    <pb n="89" xml:id="pg_89" facs="0117"/>
                    <p>In the opinion of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Israeli Air Force will
                        for the next 18 months continue to be in a superior position in the event of
                        confrontation between any likely combination of Arab forces.</p>
                    <p>In reaching this conclusion, it is important to understand the basis for it.
                        The effectiveness of Lebanon, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia is completely
                        discounted. Algeria is pretty substantially discounted due to geography.
                        That leaves the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, Syria, and Iraq as main
                        factors to be considered.</p>
                    <p>Several problems exist and several contingencies have a bearing on the
                        matter. The French could continue to renege on their contract for Mirages
                        for Israel. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> could enlarge on the
                        extent of military assistance provided to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                            >UAR</gloss>. The French could enter into a supply arrangement for
                        high-performance aircraft for radical Arabs, offsetting, perhaps, those that
                        they might provide to the Israelis. The United States and the Government of
                        Israel must keep a close eye, particularly on high-performance aircraft
                        supplied by the French or Russians to the Arab states.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Harman</persName> said that the Israeli
                        case was based on obtaining the supply of planes from the United States. He
                        seemed confident that if the French supplied the Israelis with the planes to
                        which they are committed, the French would then neutralize this supply by
                        providing planes for the Arab states.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HBGM1">Hod</persName> said that right after the
                        war the U.S. Defense Attache in Tel Aviv had asked how long it had taken to
                        plan the operation that the Israelis had just successfully completed. The
                        reply had been that it had taken 19 years. In this context 18 months was a
                        long [<hi rend="italic">short</hi>?] time by comparison. Steps were needed
                        now to be sure that the situation could be dealt with in 18 months if
                        necessary. The Israelis do not want to be victorious again with the price
                        paid in the six-day war. They doubt that they have the strength necessary to
                        deter an attack. Therefore, the Israelis considered they must buy planes now
                        to anticipate needs even within the estimates put forward by the U.S. Joint
                        Chiefs of Staff.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Harman</persName> said that Syria, the
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, and Iraq have over 500 planes.
                        Syria and Iraq are better off than they were pre-war. The <gloss
                            target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> is close to being as well off as it was
                        before June. What must be remembered is the quality of the mix of planes.
                        The Arabs had a better mix than before and had learned many things regarding
                        the use of an air force; for example, the wisdom of putting planes beyond
                        the range of the Israeli planes. Moreover, naval strength has been increased
                        in the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. All this adds up to a real need
                        on the part of the Israelis. The obsolescence factor is getting serious. Old
                        planes already heavily used are not reliable. With the 48 Skyhawks, there
                        will be a total of 200 planes, but the obsolescence factor must be
                        considered. The Israelis need a minimum of 250 for the 1968-69 period. Even
                        assuming the delivery <pb n="90" xml:id="pg_90" facs="0118"/>of the 50
                        Mirages, the Israelis need approximately 70 planes from the United States.
                        Moreover, the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> has reduced its reaction
                        time, formerly eight minutes, to four minutes. Algeria could not be written
                        off as lightly as the Joint Chiefs wish to do, as the first source of
                        resupply to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> had been Algeria. Planes
                        could be supplied with or without crews to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                            >UAR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Moreover, there was no second-strike capability on the part of the Israelis.
                        It is impossible for them to take chances. Therefore, the slightest threat
                        required a reaction when a more stable situation might deter an aggressor
                        and avoid a war. General <persName corresp="#p_HBGM1">Hod</persName>
                        reviewed the Israeli losses during the recent war in terms of their current
                        needs. In response to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s
                        question, General <persName corresp="#p_HBGM1">Hod</persName> said that the
                        TU-16's which were out of range of Israeli planes would not need to refuel
                        to reach Israel but could go from Iraq and return. Both Port Said and
                        Alexandria are blocked by modern SAM-3's.</p>
                    <p>(At this juncture, the President and the Prime Minister joined the
                        meeting.)</p>
                    <p>The President said that he and the Prime Minister had touched on several
                        problems in their meeting, including apparent differences of views between
                        the U.S. and the Israeli military authorities with regard to relative
                        strength and the needs confronting us. They had also discussed the
                        President's meeting with Prime Minister Kosygin at Glassboro and the
                        likelihood of there being discussions between the U.S. and Russia including
                        the question of Middle Eastern arms. No date has yet been set, but we still
                        hoped to find a means of reaching some sort of understanding on the arms
                        race. If none is possible, a different policy from the present situation is
                        required; but that remains to be seen.</p>
                    <p>The President wished to emphasize what he had said in the meeting the
                        preceding night which was that the United States wished to explore every
                        possibility of peace, including the opportunity afforded by Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>'s mission. We must also
                        know what kind of Israel we would be expected to assist. He must know what
                        headway could be made in order to deal with the Russians, the U.S. Congress,
                        and others. The President pointed out that Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> had mentioned several “low cards” that
                        could be played by the Israelis that could be helpful in a move toward
                        peace. The President hoped for much more detailed conversations on these
                        matters during the course of the day. He said that peace was not to be saved
                        by 27 or 50 new planes. Much more was required, including positive moves
                        toward a peaceful settlement.</p>
                    <p>The President said he wished to hear the military authorities speak and then
                        to determine whether the views could be reconciled. But very importantly, he
                        wanted answers to the question raised by Secretary <pb n="91" xml:id="pg_91"
                            facs="0119"/>
                        <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> in order to gain an over-all look
                        at what was before us on which his important decisions must rest.</p>
                    <p>The President said he was deeply concerned about peace in the Middle East,
                        including the security of Israel. There was no lack of interest on his part
                        in either element. That must be understood. There might be differences of
                        judgment as to how to bring about these aims, but his commitment to peace in
                        the area and to assist the Israelis in finding peace was basic. Prime
                        Minister Kosygin had tried to move him from his basic position in July. He
                        had not succeeded. Whether it was decided in these meetings for X, Y, or Z
                        numbers of planes, this would not solve the basic security problems. The
                        most useful thing that can be done is to reach agreement with the Soviets on
                        the arms race. The chance might be slight, but it must be tried before the
                        U.S. could embark along an irrevocable road.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister said that he hoped that there was someone in the world who
                        could tell him when and how there could be peace between Israel and its
                        neighbors. Israel feels weaker than before the war. It is a small country of
                        2-1/2 million Jews with now thousands of Arabs as well. The Arab countries
                        surround Israel. They far outnumber the Israelis in planes which are
                        increasingly of sophisticated types. Israel cannot wait until Russia gives
                        the Arabs a great many more planes and then have them say in a condition of
                        great strength that they might be ready to come to terms. Many people
                        considered in the past that a one to three ratio between Israel and Arab
                        planes was adequate. There is a limit. The Israeli fighters are better, but
                        they can't face unlimited planes. The Prime Minister said he had hoped to
                        avoid the war, particularly knowing of the stand of the U.S. and of
                        President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>. The decision kept
                        being delayed. But who knows? A minute or an hour might have changed the
                        situation. This is Israel's last chance. The Jews were there to have a
                        sovereign state which they hoped would increase in population. If France is
                        out as a supplier, “the Israelis would welcome another address where they
                        could buy.” By 1970, the Arabs will have 900 to 1,000 planes. The Israelis
                        must have 350 to 400. Only the Skyhawks agreed to before the war were being
                        supplied to them, and even this group required one year to effect
                        delivery.</p>
                    <p>Moreover, the Prime Minister had a problem if he returned from the United
                        States without a commitment for planes. The citizens of Israel would be
                        deeply troubled, and the Arabs would know and say that Israel was abandoned.
                        This could mean war, but what the Prime Minister wants is a deterrent
                        army.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HBGM1">Hod</persName> at this point repeated
                        his analysis of relative strengths as set forth above, adding only that
                        Russian pilots were flying over Cairo as recently as two weeks ago. He
                        pointed out also that Russians are in the <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                            >UAR</gloss> in great numbers. He expressed the opinion there were <pb
                            n="92" xml:id="pg_92" facs="0120"/>2,500 experts. He repeated again that
                        the Israelis don't want to win a war again. They want a deterrent to war. To
                        do so, there must be a second-strike capability or they could never take
                        chances on any Arab act of first strike. There is no substitute for
                        Phantoms.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> said that the Joint
                        Chiefs of Staff had given an estimate before the June war of what would
                        happen and had been within 1/2 day of accurately predicting the outcome.
                        While the fact that they had been right once did not mean they would be
                        right next time; nevertheless, it gave a certain support to their views.
                        There is no basic difference on numerical factors either now or projected.
                        Both the U.S. and the Government of Israel agree that 1970 will be the
                        critical year and that the Air Force is the critical service. However, in
                        looking at the Air Force and discounting Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan
                        and to a degree Algeria, we are forced to concentrate on the <gloss
                            target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, Syria, and Iraq. Assessing what had
                        happened, the inventory on hand, and all other factors, the <gloss
                            target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> believe that the Israeli Air Force can cope
                        for the next 18 months with any potential threat they face. The <gloss
                            target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> does not question the figures on losses
                        although it wishes to emphasize that what the Israelis really destroyed was
                        morale, motivation, and confidence. These cannot be recovered quickly. He
                        repeated the same factors considered earlier; i.e., whether the Soviets will
                        continue to increase the number of high-performance aircraft, whether the
                        French will honor their commitment for 50 Mirages, and whether the French
                        would counterbalance a sale of 50 Mirages with a sale to the Arabs.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> agreed that the
                        situation must be watched carefully and recognized that events could lead to
                        change to the detriment of Israel in, say, about a year.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said that he had
                        carefully considered the evidence which Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_HA1">Harman</persName> had submitted, and it seemed clear to
                        him that Israel can prevail over any potential Arab enemy. The action taken
                        with respect to the planes could bring a reaction which the Prime Minister
                        should consider. Two and a half million Jews could not stand against the
                        whole Arab world particularly if they were assisted by the Russians. Actions
                        on the plane request could have a bearing on this situation by bringing
                        further Russian support. There is no reason for the Israelis to say that
                        Israel is abandoned. This will not occur while President <persName
                            corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> is President. What must be
                        considered is how the sale of 50 F-4's would affect deGaulle. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> believed that such a
                        sale would greatly reduce any chance for a French deal. It might also
                        increase the flow of planes from Russia. What effect would such a sale have
                        on Jordan? Probably not helpful in the total context of things. With these
                        unknowns, we should move cautiously.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HBGM1">Hod</persName> said that the arms race
                        had never been affected by what the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> had
                        available. <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>-15's and <gloss
                            target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>-17's arrived without <pb n="93"
                            xml:id="pg_93" facs="0121"/>relation to the planes the Israelis had. It
                        appeared to the Israelis that the Russians had sent planes as fast as the
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> could absorb them. The Egyptians
                        would probably get <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>-23's now if the
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> could in fact absorb them.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> stressed the view
                        that both the Americans and the Israelis agreed that it would be better for
                        the U.S. not to be the only supplier of planes. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> challenged the statement on
                        abandonment by referring to the 48 A-4's supplied to the Israelis as well as
                        numerous statements in the United Nations and elsewhere of help.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName> said that the
                        question had been raised as to what the Israelis were doing to bring peace
                        in the area. He repeated the statements made the preceding night with
                        respect to support for the <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>
                        mission, the release of Egyptian prisoners, and the cooperative attitude
                        with respect to ships in the Bitter Lake. He added that the Israelis had not
                        fought the sale of arms to Jordan.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName>Herzog</persName> said that in past assessment of the
                        possibility of war, Israel had accepted the U.S. view. No war was expected
                        before 1970. He mentioned the <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>
                        mission, Soviet global policy, and the search for direct dialogue between
                        the Arabs and the Israelis as elements that will unfold in coming months. We
                        could not be sure what these three processes will do, but to help the
                        process of peace and help bring about a direct dialogue, it is essential
                        that the Israelis be in a position of strength. He also pointed out that any
                        arms arrangement could be kept secret.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HBGM1">Hod</persName> said that the only chance
                        of assuring that there would be no reason for sending U.S. troops is a
                        strong Israeli Air Force.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> said that he
                        regretted that we talked only of planes. We talked of political requirements
                        in Israel. What was he able to say to the American people with respect to
                        steps toward peace?</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Harman</persName> pointed to the limit
                        of the absorptive power of the Arabs for hardware. He felt that estimates on
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> build-up had to do with how fast
                        they could absorb. What is required as a precondition to peace is to block
                        the road to war. Syria does not want peace. It was playing the same role now
                        that it had played in April and May. The Syrians had refused to meet
                            <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> in Damascus. In the <gloss
                            target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> there is a growing sense that they are
                        “feeling their strength.” The Elath incident had helped morale greatly.
                        Other forces in the Arab world perhaps were hesitant and wanted to look
                        before they leaped. Perhaps there were such forces in the <gloss
                            target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. But the important thing was to block the
                        road to war which could be done by Israeli strength. He mentioned <persName
                            corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s speech of November 23 in which
                        President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> had said that the
                        Egyptians cannot tolerate another defeat.</p>
                    <pb n="94" xml:id="pg_94" facs="0122"/>
                    <p>The Prime Minister then picked up the discussion of the preceding night and
                        asked whether we really considered it conceivable that the Israelis abandon
                        Sharm-el-Sheikh. How could they do so without peace treaties? Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said that he confesses to a
                        bias. He wanted a political settlement and not a military settlement. Peace
                        cannot be assured by hardware. The U.S. is less secure now than it was
                        before it spent billions of dollars on defense. He had difficulty seeing his
                        way out of two points. The Government of Israel faced the danger of
                        isolation in the U.N. It had been prevented so far only by extraordinary
                        effort. A comfortable position in the U.N. might even be greater security
                        than 50 Phantoms. He hoped the Israelis would keep the situation under
                        reasonable control. In terms of the modalities, he wanted to point out that
                        there were many situations in which there was peace but no peace treaty. For
                        example, between Japan and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Next,
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> wished to mention the
                        effect of time on the situation. The U.S. believes time hurts the moderates
                        and helps the radicals. Our problem is not just the problem of Israel. The
                        responsibility of the United States Government goes much beyond that. We
                        needed help on those aspects of U.S. interest that we needed to manage.
                        Israel has a stake in this. He was not sure how we can keep the U.N.
                        situation under control and not sure how we can break Soviet influence. Some
                        indication towards the moderate Arabs would be helpful. He referred to his
                        suggestion of the preceding night that the Israelis evacuate the Straits of
                        Tiran. He also had mentioned possibly turning over of the responsibility for
                        patrolling Sharm-el-Sheikh to the United Nations which could lead to
                        withdrawal from the southern tip of the Sinai Peninsula under arrangements
                        assuring free passage through the Straits and requiring Security Council
                        approval before the troops could be withdrawn. He hoped the Israelis would
                        help us find other examples which would improve the chances of a solution.
                        The interests of the U.S. were world wide and involved.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister said he must ask who would assure free passage through the
                        Suez Canal. The Secretary said he was not suggesting that the Israelis
                        withdraw until the issue of the Canal is settled. Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_HA1">Harman</persName> said that there was no equivalence of
                        position in the Security Council. Whatever the Arabs wanted the Soviets
                        supported, and the Arabs had a Soviet veto for anything they opposed.</p>
                    <p>At this point the meeting adjourned for lunch.</p>

                        convened a meeting of those listed above. The President opened the meeting
                        by saying that the group had touched at various times on the problem of
                        desalinization in the area. He said that he felt it desirable from our point
                        of view to find the best person possible to work on this important study and
                        that he would soon designate the best qualified individual he could find to
                        deal with the matter.</p>
                    <p>The President then mentioned the communique agreed upon by his staff and that
                        of Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName>.<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d41fn2">The joint communique was issued from the <gloss

                    <p>The Prime Minister then said that he had been considering how he could help
                        with the matters raised concerning possible steps toward peace. He said that
                        the U.S. had raised the question of Tiran. He wished to point out that from
                        that island it was possible to hinder navigation in the Straits of Tiran.
                        Could the U.S. work out an agreement with <persName corresp="#p_FAAAS1"
                            >Faisal</persName>
                        <pb n="96" xml:id="pg_96" facs="0124"/>that would prevent the island from
                        being armed so that this interference could not occur? The basis for any
                        agreement must be that the island “not become a tyrant”. It is a small
                        island, and it is doubtful whether anyone would want or could live there. If
                        the U.S. can go to <persName corresp="#p_FAAAS1">Faisal</persName> and take
                        up the matter with him, and if the U.S. will then tell the Government of
                        Israel in writing that this island will not be used to hamper or hinder
                        navigation, the Prime Minister would have something new to take to his
                        military people and to his Cabinet which might permit an understanding. The
                        Prime Minister said he wished to point out that he was looking for things to
                        limit President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s burdens and
                        would continue to do so.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> then said that we would
                        examine what could be done with respect to the island of Tiran.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> said that he hoped
                        the Prime Minister would join with him in instructing Foreign Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> and Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> to explore together every possible
                        factor that could be fitted into the search for peace. The world will expect
                        a great deal from us, and we must do what we can to find ways toward
                        solution of the problems.</p>
                    <p>The President continued by saying that Israel's security is important to us.
                        That is basic to much that had been said, and he wished to emphasize it. We
                        also had other problems in the area. We had considered what could be done
                        with respect to Jordan. Is it better if we do nothing and leave the vacuum
                        for Russia to fill? We consider it better that we enter into a small program
                        rather than to run the risk that the Russians will arm Jordan without
                        limitation.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister said that he preferred that any country in the area be
                        tied up with the U.S. rather than the Soviets. If the U.S. finds it must
                        provide equipment to avoid Jordan's obtaining it from the Soviets or
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, he hoped it would be as
                        little as possible. The Israelis will not criticize the decision. However,
                        he hoped the U.S. will not say that Israel agrees or approves. When
                        questioned as to whether he would prefer arms shipments to Jordan from the
                        U.S. or the Soviets, he must obviously say the U.S. While he would prefer no
                        arms at all, if the U.S. considered something necessary, go ahead.</p>
                    <p>The President then reaffirmed his concern for the security of Israel. He said
                        we must have very straight talk between the two countries on a continuing
                        basis. He thought both sides could agree on three objectives. First, there
                        is the need to do what can be done to bring about a stable peace in the
                        Middle East. We are particularly anxious not to be charged with impeding
                            <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>'s peace mission. Again,
                        the President stated his hope that the Foreign Minister and Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> would explore every avenue to
                        bring success in the search for peace. Second, both of us are anxious to
                        deter if possible an arms race in the Middle East and to avoid escalation of
                        that race. The United States <pb n="97" xml:id="pg_97" facs="0125"/>wants to
                        give no excuse to the Soviets for an increase of arms in the area. The U.S.
                        is uncertain what the Russians will do in this area, but in any event it is
                        our joint purpose to deter an arms race. Third, the U.S. has as a hope and
                        purpose the goal of assuring, if necessary, adequate equipment to the
                        Israeli Air Force to defend itself. What the U.S. does will reflect the
                        judgment of the President; but the judgment of the Israelis will affect his
                        final decision. Again, Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_EA1"
                            >Eban</persName> and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1"
                            >Rusk</persName> in the search for contributions toward peace should
                        carefully check other aspects such as all ship movements, Soviet military
                        shipments into the area, etc. In connection with this third goal, the
                        President wished to suggest the addition of the following sentence to the
                        communique: “The President agreed to keep Israel's military defense
                        capability under active and sympathetic review in the light of all relevant
                        factors, including the shipment of military equipment by others into the
                        area.” This statement would show that the third goal was possible. The U.S.
                        will be helpful. This statement is a deterrent to the Arabs and might push
                        them toward restraint. The statement also says, “Stop, look, and listen” to
                        the Soviets. It is not as contentious as arms shipments would be, but it
                        will help give the people of Israel something to stand on. Meanwhile, both
                        sides must stay in touch through intelligence authorities and hope for an
                        agreed assessment of the threat.</p>
                    <p>The President said that the generals on both sides are agreed on what to
                        expect in the future. They agree that the Israeli Air Force might not be
                        adequate to meet its needs in January of 1970 depending on what happens. In
                        order to have the tools needed, the Israelis urge that a decision be made
                        now. The President said he wished to ask Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> in the event the President
                        decided to deliver a certain number of planes to take steps to minimize the
                        time required so as to have these planes in Israeli hands by January, 1970.
                        The Israelis must decide how much time they need in order to get pilots
                        trained and ready to operate on that date. The U.S. will take steps to be
                        ready to respond, and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1"
                            >McNamara</persName> would establish when we have to decide in order to
                        deliver Phantoms in January, 1970. The President stated emphatically that he
                        was not prepared to make that decision today. He would add, however, 27
                        A-4's or 30 A-4's. Perhaps another 10 if actually needed. And he would
                        assist on a crash basis in training crews for the Phantoms in order that
                        there be no gap between delivery and ability to operate, providing a
                        decision was, in fact, later made to deliver.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HBGM1">Hod</persName> said that he could train
                        pilots in 12 to 18 months.</p>
                    <p>The question of delivery schedule on the F-4's was discussed. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said that lead time on
                        F-4's was 24 months. The U.S. has, however, a large production, and by
                        December 31, 1968 it may be possible to deliver in 12 months.</p>
                    <pb n="98" xml:id="pg_98" facs="0126"/>
                    <p>The delivery schedule for the Skyhawks (A-4's) was discussed. The Prime
                        Minister asked whether the delivery of the Skyhawks could be accelerated.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> replied that we
                        could not move up delivery. We would try to deliver the 27 at approximately
                        the rate of four per month beginning in January 1969 so that there would be
                        a steady flow coming after the 48 A-4's already contracted for. It will take
                        about six months to get the unique Israeli equipment necessary for these
                        planes, and it will be cheaper for the Israelis to have an even flow of
                        delivery. He was not sure the earlier delivery of the 27 was possible; but
                        he would try.</p>
                    <p>The President said he wanted Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1"
                            >Rusk</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> to
                        start to work immediately—which was a basic requirement—on the steps toward
                        peace. At the same time he wanted Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1"
                            >McNamara</persName> to give him a statement of the latest possible date
                        for a decision that would put him in a position to deliver Phantoms by
                        January 1970—provided he later made that decision. He wanted to make clear
                        there was no commitment to deliver Phantoms. However, he wanted Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> to work out the
                        schedule to permit implementation of the President's decision if he decided
                        to deliver Phantoms by January 1970. The agreement must be secret and any
                        leak would present major problems; and all arrangements were null and void
                        if secrecy is not maintained. The President continued by saying that he
                        wished to talk with the Soviets, the Arabs, and with the U.S. Congress. He
                        also hoped that the Israeli military authorities would discuss with General
                            <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> the problem of training
                        pilots and ground crews. If any pilots were trained prior to any decision to
                        send F-4's, it was essential that this arrangement be kept secret.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister then asked whether instead of January 1970, it would be
                        possible to step up delivery of the Phantoms to the middle of 1969 if
                        necessary. Moreover, he would consider it a favor if the President could
                        find some way to tell him that in 1968 he would send one dozen F-4's and the
                        rest later. The response to this question from the U.S. side was
                        negative.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> mentioned that
                        there had been no arrangements on financing and that this would have to be
                        worked out. Thirty A-4's would cost some $39 million or more, and 50 F-4's
                        would cost something like $200 million depending on what electronic
                        equipment, etc. was included.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister returned again to the thought that some F-4's could be
                        delivered during 1968. The President repeated that he wanted the generals on
                        both sides to tell him when the decision must be made in order that planes
                        and pilots be ready for delivery by January 1, 1970 provided he decided to
                        do so. The President rejected the idea of starting in 1968. The Prime
                        Minister again asked for delivery soon; for example, <pb n="99"
                            xml:id="pg_99" facs="0127"/>for one per month in 1968. The President
                        said what is at issue here is not the number but the decision. The Soviets
                        and Arabs must prove the Israelis are right before the President would make
                        this decision.</p>
                    <p>In response to a comment by Dr. <persName>Herzog</persName>, the President
                        said that he had outlined the basis for doing exactly what the Israelis had
                        asked and on the time-table they have requested provided he decided it was
                        necessary. Meanwhile, we must try to get the Russians to reach an
                        understanding and to urge the Arabs to exercise restraint. The President
                        remarked that President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> seemed
                        to be feeling somewhat more subdued, and there were some indications that he
                        wished to find a road to peace and an avenue to a resumption of relations
                        with the United States.</p>

                        <item>Today's situation came about primarily because we were late in
                            responding to the King's oral message of December 30 to the
                                President.<note n="4" xml:id="d42fn4">See <ref target="#d29fn3"
                                    >footnote 3, Document 29</ref>.</note> Beyond that, however, the
                            King apparently had decided we were only stringing him along, that we
                            had no intention of discussing or supplying more than token arms to
                            Jordan, and that in effect we had called his hand. Reliable Jordanian
                            sources and an Embassy officer who knows him well said the King has been
                            under considerable psychological tension on this matter. My own limited
                            experience with <persName>Hussein</persName> confirms that he has become
                            quite desperate and somewhat overwrought. Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName>'s visit and the recent series of
                            difficulties on the border have contributed to his sense of being
                            cornered. We are also informed he has developed a deep sense of guilt
                            about the events of June.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>I would emphasize that in agreeing (1) to postpone the visit of the
                            Soviet military delegation, (2) to withdraw the letter and (3) to send
                            Genl <persName corresp="#p_KGA1">Khammash</persName> to Washington, the
                            King understands we seriously intend to come to a meeting of the minds
                            with Genl <persName corresp="#p_KGA1">Khammash</persName> on what arms
                            we are willing to supply to Jordan. <persName corresp="#p_KGA1"
                                >Khammash</persName> will have full powers to discuss this matter. I
                            think he and the King recognize they may not get all they want, but they
                            do expect more than token satisfaction and playing for time. If we are
                            not able to agree on “legitimate requirements,” then the King will
                            consider he has no alternative to rescheduling the visit of the Soviet
                            delegation and, presumably, accepting Soviet offers.</item>

                    <p>CAP 0247. Subject: PL 480 Agreement for Jordan.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FO1">Freeman</persName>, Bill Gaud and
                        Charlie Schultze recommend you approve a $2.1 million wheat agreement for
                        Jordan. Treasury concurs. This would cover 30,000 tons for dollars over
                        twenty years.</p>
                    <p>This agreement will partly substitute for aid dollars. Since Jordan for the
                        moment is receiving all the foreign exchange aid it needs, we suspended our
                        budget support as of the final quarter of 1967. Our strategy is to combine
                        this PL 480 deal and $3 million in aid technical assistance funds as a
                        substitute for that last quarter of budget support to cushion the transition
                        to no support in 1968. We plan to use the aid money for feasibility studies
                        that will help the Jordanians use the Arab money they have to good permanent
                        advantage.</p>
                    <p>This would be useful politically, too. It is one of the few positive things
                        we've been able to do. The Jordanians are upset that we are ending budget
                        support, and we are just barely scraping through on the military side. We
                        got our response on arms out the day after <persName>Hussein</persName> had
                        agreed to receive Soviet mission. Harry Symmes had to persuade
                            <persName>Hussein</persName> to withdraw a letter stating that our
                        response had come too late and to put off the Soviet visit. He succeeded,
                        but we may still have a hard enough time responding adequately to his arms
                        requests. A move on the economic side would help a little. Now that we have
                        Israeli acquiescence to our blocking the Soviets in Jordan, I think we need
                        to get back into business in every way we reasonably can. Fortunately, PL
                        480 is one of the few resources we can use relatively freely.</p>
                    <p>You should know that this is the first substantial agreement to be processed
                        under the new “Symington amendment”<note n="2" xml:id="d43fn2">The Symington

                        the aid bill which requires the President to “take into consideration”
                        whether such aid will be diverted to military ends or enable the recipient
                        to support unnecessary military expenditures. As you know, we have kept the
                        Jordanian military budget within agreed limits. The percentage of total
                        expenditures has been quite high but declining. The Jordanians are the only
                        Arab combatants in the June war that have not purchased substantial
                        replacements for their loses.</p>

                                >USG</gloss> position on Jerusalem. We have repeatedly made clear
                            that we do not recognize unilateral action affecting the status of
                            Jerusalem and that its status must necessarily be considered in the
                            context of all problems arising out of the recent conflict. Of
                            particular pertinence, the President and Prime Minister privately in
                            their Texas talks instructed the Secretary and <persName
                                corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> to consult on ways of advancing the
                            cause of peace, and the Secretary plans to write <persName
                                corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> shortly in this connection. Israeli
                            actions appear to undercut that assignment before it has begun. Further,
                            Israeli actions affecting status of Jerusalem have direct bearing on
                            chances for success of <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>
                            negotiations and are thus inconsistent with language of joint statement
                            of the President and Prime Minister endorsing <gloss target="#t_UNSC1"
                                >UNSC</gloss> Resolution and mission of Ambassador <persName

                            Jerusalem will be a critical issue in any peace settlement. Consequently
                            Israeli measures described in <hi rend="italic">NYTimes</hi> article
                            will further strengthen Arab suspicions that Israelis are not serious
                            about an equitable peace settlement and will discourage Arabs from a
                            serious posture towards negotiation.<note n="3" xml:id="d44fn3">

                                    >Katzenbach</persName> stated that Israeli measures in East
                                Jerusalem were creating a situation in which a decision to annex
                                East Jerusalem was becoming increasingly irreversible. He felt that
                                some modification of Israeli policy was essential if there was to be
                                an agreed Arab-Israeli settlement. He was concerned that the Israeli
                                Government might be underestimating the strength of the U.S. views
                                on this issue, and he instructed <persName corresp="#p_BW1"

                        Indian Embassy, called at Department for marathon discussion January 12.
                        Burden his remarks was that Arabs had come a long way to meet our
                        requirements since last summer but US continued unalterably pro-Israel and
                        upped the ante every time Arabs showed any sign of reasonableness. Said he
                        had seen both Zakariyah Muhieddin and <persName corresp="#p_RM1">Mahmoud
                            Riad</persName> on eve his departure and was authorized by both of them
                        to say <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> sincerely interested in peaceful
                        settlement and would like to remove Palestine problem from agenda. Toward
                        this goal they thought they following Secretary's advice to be wise and
                        reasonable, but they genuinely perplexed to know what <gloss
                            target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> wanted.</p>
                    <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_GA1">Ghorbal</persName> maintained that since last
                        June there had not been one public statement of US appreciation for
                        moderation being shown by Arabs. Furthermore we had announced we were giving
                        offensive aircraft to Israel immediately following its inhuman attack on
                        Suez, and now President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> had
                        told <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName> he understood latter's
                        problems in trying to obtain peace in Middle East, because he was having
                        same sort of problem in Viet-Nam. This was unfortunate comparison. Fact was
                        Israelis were ones who did not want peace and it had been Israelis who
                        invaded Egypt, not vice versa. Egypt had been looking for peaceful way out
                        of dilemma and had been ready to send Muhieddin to Washington, when Israelis
                        had attacked. Egyptians had listened to our warnings not to attack, but
                        Israelis had not heeded them. Now Egypt wanted peaceful settlement but
                        Israelis were consolidating their gains and US not doing anything to stop
                        them. For Egyptians, sine qua non of peaceful settlement was Israeli
                        withdrawal, and only US could effect that. If we not prepared exert our
                        influence to that end, entire area would be irretrievably lost to West.</p>
                    <p>3. <gloss target="#t_Deptoff1">Deptoff</gloss> replied we still prepared put
                        our full weight behind settlement within terms November 22 <gloss
                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolution, but we could not impose solution
                        on any of parties. Package must be something everyone could live with. It
                        quite true we had put no pressure on Israelis to withdraw, and would not do
                        so in absence reasonable proposals for <pb n="105" xml:id="pg_105"
                            facs="0133"/>settlement. Israelis maintained with reason that they could
                        not be expected to fight war of national survival every ten years and could
                        not return to unstable status quo ante. They had also indicated however that
                        their stated positions not inflexible and there was room for bargaining. We
                        saw <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>'s task as that of
                        exploring positions of both sides and establishing outlines of settlement.
                        We hoped he would come up with something workable, but had taken decision
                        not to get involved ourselves at this stage because we did not wish to
                        affect chances of settlement by having proposals identified as ours.
                        Although questions of Jerusalem, Suez and Gaza posed difficulties, we
                        thought honorable global settlement was possible. Settlement would include
                        non-belligerency and withdrawal to agreed boundaries. We had reached no firm
                        position on what those boundaries should be, but assumed armistice lines
                        would be basis. There would have to be some rectifications however and there
                        would have to be some demilitarization. Essential element in getting such
                        settlement was that <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> have some faith in
                        our intentions.</p>
                    <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_GA1">Ghorbal</persName> said <gloss
                            target="#t_Deptoff1">Deptoff</gloss> remarks confirmed Egyptian
                        suspicions we were in fact supporting Israelis in their efforts to dictate
                        terms. We were saying in effect that Israelis would not withdraw until they
                        had what they wanted, and that we supported them in this. We could not
                        expect Egyptians to put any faith or trust in us under these circumstances.

                                <p>We noted to the Prime Minister the desirability that Israel
                                    provide public indications of its willingness to reach
                                    understandings with the Arabs and suggested that withdrawal of
                                    your troops from Tiran would be one example of what we had in
                                    mind. The Prime Minister expressed understanding of this view
                                    but indicated that it would be difficult for your government to
                                    contemplate withdrawal from Tiran in the absence of assurances
                                    regarding the consequences of this act for Israel.</p>
                                <p>Encouraged by these exchanges, I subsequently instructed the US
                                    Ambassador to Saudi Arabia to explore this question further with
                                    King <persName corresp="#p_FAAAS1">Faisal</persName>. Our
                                    Ambassador had a frank and detailed discussion of this subject
                                    with His Majesty on January 13. The King's comments made clear:
                                    (a) that he regards Tiran Island as part of Saudi territory, and
                                        <pb n="107" xml:id="pg_107" facs="0135"/>that, for example,
                                    his government has granted a concession covering the island; and
                                    (b) that he has no plan to militarize Tiran or to use it to
                                    impede freedom of navigation into Tiran Strait.</p>
                                <p>I am greatly encouraged by His Majesty's position. On the basis
                                    of his assurances to our Ambassador, I believe that the problems
                                    the Israeli side foresaw if your government withdrew will not
                                    arise. Specifically, I would expect neither alienation of this
                                    portion of Saudi territory, its militarization nor its use in
                                    any way to interfere with freedom of navigation through the
                                    Straits of Tiran. I would therefore hope that your government
                                    would now consider that its troops can be withdrawn from the
                                    island without incurring adverse consequences for Israel.</p>
                                <p>As we have earlier indicated to your government, such action will
                                    remove a serious embarrassment in our own relations with the
                                    Saudi authorities. I therefore look forward to receiving a
                                    favorable response from your government. It will, of course, be
                                    immediately communicated to King <persName corresp="#p_FAAAS1"
                                        >Faisal</persName> and will, I am sure, have a useful and
                                    helpful impact.<note n="4" xml:id="d47fn4">In a conversation

                                        Israeli Cabinet but first needed a U.S. response to a number
                                        of “clarifications.” <persName corresp="#p_HA1"
                                            >Harman</persName> asked if the United States could
                                        obtain Saudi Arabian acknowledgment that the Straits of
                                        Tiran was an international waterway. Israel also asked
                                        whether the United States could obtain from Saudi Arabia a
                                        “binding written undertaking” that Tiran Island would remain
                                        permanently uninhabited. Israel also asked whether the
                                        United States would underwrite any such Saudi undertakings
                                        by making them a matter of U.S. “responsibility and
                                        commitment” as regards Israel. <persName corresp="#p_HA1"

                        back at us when it comes out formally, saying we've already voided our plea

                    <p>I agree in general with the State paper. I think, however, it overstates the
                        probability of <persName>Hussein</persName> going to the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> for military equipment: he continues to
                        depend upon us to help him in negotiations with Israel for his lost
                        territory, he surely wants our continuing economic assistance, and his
                        physical security depends on his association with the West, particularly the
                        United States, and with the moderate Arabs, particularly <persName
                            corresp="#p_FAAAS1">Faisal</persName> of Saudi Arabia. While there
                        certainly is a risk that he will go to the Soviets for military equipment. I
                        believe we have more leverage with <persName>Hussein</persName> than the
                        State paper implies.</p>
                    <p>I think also that it ignores the implications of the Conte-Long

                        <item>At the end of our conversation today, King
                                <persName>Hussein</persName> said there was a very sensitive matter
                            that he felt he should mention to me. He then explained that when he was
                            in Saudi Arabia last week he had heard from a “high level” that “some of
                            the Arab terrorist organizations” are planning the assassination of
                            certain Israeli officials, with <persName corresp="#p_DM1">Moshe
                                Dayan</persName> being a principal target. (The King said he had
                            voiced his strong disapproval of such a course of action, and implied
                            that his source also disapproved of these alleged terrorist plans.) With
                            some embarrassment he said he left it to me as to how or whether these
                            reports should be brought to the attention of the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>. He said he wanted to make it
                            absolutely clear that he is opposed to terrorism in general and to
                            assassination of individuals in particular.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>In connection with terrorism, King <persName>Hussein</persName> said
                            his intelligence information is that the situation is becoming much
                            worse. More terrorists are coming from Syria and others are coming in
                            from Gaza and Iraq. He has issued orders to insure that the situation in
                            South Jordan is cleaned up completely. He believes that terrorist
                            threats can be handled more easily in that region but the situation
                            opposite the West Bank remains difficult. He volunteered that one
                            purpose of his forthcoming trip to Baghdad (which will now be delayed
                            until early February) will be to speak to the Iraqis about getting
                                <gloss target="#t_PLO1">PLO</gloss> and terrorist elements out of
                            Jordan. He noted parenthetically that he expects he and others may also
                            become terrorist targets.</item>

                        <item>The main Soviet objective in the Middle East remains essentially the
                            same as before the June war—to win for the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss> a position as dominant foreign power in the area. The

                            />and new opportunities. Nonetheless the radical Arabs are now more
                            dependent on the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, and the Soviets
                            probably judge that the new opportunities will compensate for such
                            losses as they suffered as a result of the Arab defeat.</item>
                        <label>B.</label>
                        <item>The Soviets are not likely to make binding military commitments to any
                            Arab states, and they will almost certainly remain wary of direct
                            involvement even in limited conflicts in the Middle East. They probably
                            do not intend to establish actual Soviet military bases in the area, but
                            will seek instead to help the Arabs develop ports and air bases which
                            might be used by Soviet forces on a limited basis. The Soviets will
                            improve the capabilities of their naval forces in the Mediterranean and
                            of their sea and airlift capabilities in general. They will probably
                            continue to use their forces in the Middle East for essentially
                            political purposes-to influence events and to improve their position in
                            the region. Nonetheless, resumption of Arab-Israeli hostilities would
                            produce a dangerous and essentially unpredictable situation, in which
                            the risks of Soviet involvement, by accident or miscalculation, might be
                            greater than before.</item>
                        <label>C.</label>
                        <item>The Soviets will probably continue to give strong, though not
                            unlimited, backing to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>,
                            whom they continue to regard as their chief Arab ally. Despite some

                                >Nasser</persName>'s desire to maintain independence, Soviet and
                                <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> policies on important issues are
                            congruent-notably, opposition to US influence in the area, a cautious
                            policy toward Israel, and at least short-term accommodation between Arab
                            radicals and moderates.</item>
                        <label>D.</label>
                        <item>In Jordan, the Soviets are attempting to extend their influence by
                            generous offers of military aid. We believe that
                                <persName>Hussein</persName> will accept Soviet arms if the Western
                            Powers fail to offer an acceptable alternative. He would still try to
                            maintain countervailing ties with conservative Arabs and the West, but
                            over time revolutionary forces in Jordan would be strengthened.</item>
                        <label>E.</label>
                        <item>In Yemen, Soviet military aid and activity is probably aimed at
                            preventing the collapse of the Republican regime. But the Soviets have
                            now moved to limit their involvement, possibly because they have revised
                            their estimate of Republican prospects, and they are encouraging a
                            negotiated settlement. They will, however, probably continue some aid as
                            long as the Republican regime can make use of it, hoping in this way to
                            preserve some influence in Yemen and eventually to promote Soviet
                            interests in South Yemen. In doing so, they will probably try to avoid
                            the kind of overt bid for dominance which would kindle adverse reactions
                            in the area, particularly among their Arab clients.</item>

                            <item>On the question of when the Israeli air force might face a serious
                                threat, the President felt that was an issue for Generals <persName
                                    corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> and <persName
                                    corresp="#p_HBGM1">Hod</persName> to settle. He did not commit
                                himself to any particular intelligence assessment. The President had
                                said he was concerned with Israel's security, and we should leave it
                                at that.</item>

                            <item>What concerned the President was to make sure he would be in a
                                position, if he delayed a decision on supplying Phantom aircraft to
                                Israel, to deliver those aircraft, if he decided later to do so, as
                                if he had made a decision the day he talked to Prime Minister
                                    <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName>. He recognized that
                                normal lead times would require him to decide right now; he wanted
                                to delay decision and yet still preserve the option to deliver as if
                                he had decided today.</item>

                            <item>The question he did not address is how we might deal with some
                                emergency-for instance, a sudden influx of Soviet arms. That is a
                                separate problem. That wasn't the problem he was confronted with at
                                the Ranch. That was outside the scope of decisions made
                                there.</item>

                            <item>
                                <p>We do not have a formal record of the President's views on
                                    delivery schedules. He knows the normal production schedule of
                                    aircraft, but this point was not addressed by the President, and
                                    it is not wise to try to force him to decide now.</p>
                                <p>At this point, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EE1">Evron</persName>
                                    asked whether he might tell Prime Minister <persName
                                        corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName> that the President had
                                    instructed Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1"
                                        >McNamara</persName> to keep open the option of delivering
                                    an unspecified number-20, 30, 40-of aircraft in January 1970.
                                    Mr. <persName>Rostow</persName> replied, “I can't say that. We
                                    didn't address the question. We were thinking of normal
                                    build-up. The only question the President addressed was allowing
                                    himself some turnaround time before having to decide and still
                                    be able to meet a normal schedule.”</p>

                            <item>In conclusion, what we need to do is (a) get the intelligence
                                people working hard and steadily and (b) get the latest date for
                                decision <pb n="116" xml:id="pg_116" facs="0144"/>from Generals
                                    <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> and <persName
                                    corresp="#p_HBGM1">Hod</persName> (on training) and from
                                Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> (on
                                production). But on the issue of emergency diversion from existing
                                production, don't raise this contingency matter until you have
                                reason to raise it. The President has not now addressed rates of
                                delivery.</item>

                        <item>In conversation with Emboff Jan 9 MajGen Muhammad Rasoul Kilani, Chief
                            of <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> General Intelligence Directorate
                            (GID), requested assistance from the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                            in the field of terrorist interdiction and suppression. Gen. Kilani
                            stated that the <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> wishes to accomplish
                            two things: (A) completely stop the flow of terrorists through Jordan
                            and break up their organizations; and (B) do this in such a way that it
                            will not incite the people of Jordan (who are generally pro-terrorist)
                            to insurrection against the regime.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>Gen. Kilani said that one of his main concerns is that if the
                            terrorists build an effective organizational structure, sooner or later
                            this could be used against the <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss>
                            instead of the Israelis. King and <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                            already believe this intent. He added that he had been exposed to some
                            of the philosophy and tactics of counterinsurgency when he had been a
                            student at the counterinsurgency school at Fort Bragg, he felt that
                            between the US Army and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> there could
                            be developed a set of tactics which would help Jordan in this
                            problem.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>Rasoul said that he was not asking for “experts” to be sent <gloss
                                target="#t_TDY1">TDY</gloss> from the US, but rather asking for a
                            thorough review of the Jordan/Israel cease-fire line situation which
                            would make some concrete recommendations. He expected that the
                            recommendations might very well entail use of some new and sophisticated
                            technical devices, which he would then request and employ operationally.
                            While he would not shrink from using armed force when necessary, he
                            would like as much <pb n="117" xml:id="pg_117" facs="0145"/>as possible
                            to be able to keep the anti-terrorist campaign “under cover” and avoid
                            alerting the people to the <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss>'s real
                            intent.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>Emboff agreed to report Kilani's request. Emboff later asked Rasoul's
                            deputy whether GID was having serious problems with villagers and
                            refugees when it worked against various terrorist groups, and he
                            answered that the problem was quite serious and promised to become more
                            so if this political settlement issue remained stagnated.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>Emboff understanding was that Rasoul thinking along lines of
                            installing anti-infiltration devices on Jordanian side of the cease-fire
                            line under some pretext which would convince people that these were
                            protective devices. He also seemed to be searching for new ideas to use
                            in convincing the population that anti-terrorist activity was either not
                            going on or was in fact aimed at another target. Rasoul gave no hint to
                            suggest he would consider cooperating with Israel in this
                            activity.</item>

                            <hi rend="italic">Comment and Recommendations:</hi> (A) Jordanian
                            leadership has consistently maintained anti-terrorist posture. Best
                            recent evidence that this posture is genuine has been provided by
                            obvious dismay over Eilat incidents which they fear can trigger reprisal
                            against Aqaba, with both political and logistical damage to Jordan. (B)
                            At the same time, popular support for spirit of resistance personified
                            by infiltrators is growing along with continued frustration of hopes for
                            peaceful solution. Capacity of leadership to enforce anti-terrorist
                            infiltration campaign is correspondingly being eroded. (C) On top of
                            this complication, physical problems of policing cease-fire line which
                            provides good infiltration access at many points impose practical limits
                            on what can be done even with the best of will. (D) Also it is only
                            realistic to recognize that will to enforce measures will vary down
                            through the rank and file and that there will be loopholes. (E) Given
                            prospects for continued slow progress toward a solution (assuming
                            continued progress), the problem of infiltration and terrorism promises
                            to increase. (F) We are not in a position to judge the practical merit
                            of sophisticated infiltration measures which might be employed pursuant
                            to Rasoul's thinking. We believe this should be evaluated and that we
                            should respond as constructively as possible to this overture. Over and
                            above the possible practical effects on reducing terrorist infiltration,
                            we have major concern for reducing tensions on both sides over issue and
                            moves such as this may help. Incidentally, <gloss target="#t_GOJ1"

                        <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> was pleased with your

                    <p>The main question now is our next step. Bob Anderson has volunteered to see a
                        representative of <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> in either
                        Geneva or Malta next week, and Gene <persName corresp="#p_BER1"
                            >Black</persName> will be in Cairo on a regular visit January 31 to
                        February 6. Do we want to use either?</p>
                    <p>There are two issues: <list>
                            <item>—Do we ask to discuss details of resumption? You have already told
                                    <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> that you share his
                                desire to resume relations and that <persName corresp="#p_BDC1">Don
                                    Bergus</persName> is prepared to discuss details. From <persName
                                    corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s failure to have the
                                Foreign Office get down to cases with him, we begin to assume that
                                he wants us to initiate discussions so they can say we came begging.
                                Commissioning <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> or
                                    <persName corresp="#p_BER1">Black</persName> to offer to begin
                                talking specifics would lay you open to the kind of news stories the
                                Cairo press launched during <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                                    >Anderson</persName>'s last mission picturing you as running
                                after <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>.</item>
                            <item>—How do we handle retraction of the false charges that we took
                                part in the June war? <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
                                told <persName corresp="#p_BDC1">Bergus</persName> he didn't make
                                any, but those charges were the reason <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                                    >Nasser</persName> gave for breaking with us. We probably can't
                                expect <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> himself to
                                retract, and a casual retraction in one of their newspapers wouldn't
                                help us too much. But it might be possible for us to say
                                unilaterally we assume that, by resuming relations, Cairo had
                                acknowledged that the basis for breaking was unfounded.<note n="4"

                                        corresp="#p_BDC1">Bergus</persName> made the point that
                                    since the United Arab Republic had broken relations the
                                    initiative for the resumption of relations should come from
                                    Cairo and that relations, if restored, should be substantive
                                    rather than formal. Riad noted that his government feared that
                                    an initiative from Cairo might meet with an embarrassing public
                                    rebuff from Washington. <persName corresp="#p_BDC1"

                                    discussed the issue of compensation for U.S. property damaged

                    <p>I would vote against using Bob. He could take this line: We're ready; talk to
                            <persName corresp="#p_BDC1">Bergus</persName>. But that seems hardly
                        worth a trip from Cairo to Geneva and back. Besides, a special meeting of
                        this kind might attract more publicity than we want.</p>
                    <p>I think Gene <persName corresp="#p_BER1">Black</persName> could serve a
                        useful purpose in Cairo. I would recommend authorizing him to say two
                        things: <list>
                            <item>—Urge Nasser to have his Foreign Office get down to specifics with

                            <item>—You have a political problem that requires setting the record

                    </p>
                    <p>I think it's worth using Gene. I don't have any illusions about changing our
                        relations with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> much, though I
                        do think we're better off with a U.S. presence in Cairo to show we're not
                        abandoning the field to Moscow. But resumption with Cairo would pave the way
                        for resuming business in other Arab capitals-a first step toward repairing
                        the damage to our position throughout the Arab world. No one will move till
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> does.</p>
                    <p>We don't honestly know whether <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
                        really wants to resume. He believes we're 100% behind Israel, and he frankly
                        admitted to <persName corresp="#p_BDC1">Bergus</persName> that suspicion of
                        us is so great that it is not yet possible to move into a new period of
                        friendship based on trust. But another probe by Gene <persName

                        of a worthwhile gain.</p>

                            January 19, reported on a conversation on recent terrorist incidents
                            between an Embassy official and the head of Jordanian intelligence. The
                            terrorist incidents which prompted U.S. concern included a mortar attack
                            by Palestinian infiltrators on the Israeli airfield at Eilat on January
                            13 and a Palestinian attack the following day on the Israeli border

                    <p>1. Department increasingly concerned that recent outbreaks of terrorism in
                        areas of Israel near Jordan and on West Bank may lead to further escalation
                        of hostilities. We are particularly concerned that incidents such as that of
                        Eilat will strengthen in Israel the hands of the advocates of retaliation as
                        an answer to terroristic activity. We have been persistently urging
                        restraint on the Israelis but we are not sanguine about consequences if
                        tempo of incidents continues. We cannot overemphasize the crucial importance

                    <p>102228. For the Ambassador. Request you seek early appointment with Kosygin
                        to make following statement: (If Kosygin not available within next day or
                        so, you should see Gromyko and ask him to transmit to Kosygin soonest.)</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Begin Text</hi>. [Here follows the portion of President
                            <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s message to Chairman
                        Kosygin dealing with the proposed non-proliferation treaty.]</p>
                    <p>On the question of arms to the Middle East, the Chairman will have received
                        by now Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>'s report
                        of his conversation with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1"
                            >Rusk</persName> on January 9. This matter, too, is urgent and the
                        President has asked me to stress his deep concern at the impact that
                        continued arms traffic may have on the Middle East situation. We know from
                        past experience that resort to arms is an ever-present danger in the Middle
                        East. Not only does such action not resolve the problem, but it poses the
                        danger of the spread of war beyond the confines of the area. The President
                        has watched with growing concern the extensive delivery of arms to the area
                        from the Soviet Union. The United States is under considerable pressure, as
                        a consequence, to take matching action. Despite this pressure, my Government
                        has exercised great <pb n="122" xml:id="pg_122" facs="0150"/>restraint, most
                        recently in its agreement to provide Israel with only limited numbers of
                        aircraft, without new models, and only in continuation of our agreement with
                        Israel of 1966. By agreeing only to this limited extension of the 1966
                        agreement and by deferring decision on the introduction of new advanced
                        aircraft into the area, we have exercised restraint and it is the
                        President's earnest hope that this will be reciprocated by the Soviet
                        Government. In this way our two governments could assist Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> in carrying out his vital
                        mission and thus make a substantial contribution to prospects for a just and
                        peaceful settlement in the Middle East. <hi rend="italic">End Text</hi>.</p>

                                studying the problem. They would also study points made in the

                            <item>Turning to the Middle East, Kosygin asserted everything depended
                                on US and the President. There was, of course, a <gloss
                                    target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolution in existence. When he
                                talked with the President, such questions as opening of canal,
                                recognition of Israel, and Israeli withdrawal from occupied
                                territories had been discussed. As regards Soviet aid, he wished to
                                point out that the Soviets never rendered assistance to aggressor,
                                always to victim of aggression. One could not equate Arabs and
                                Israelis, since the Israelis had launched aggression. The Middle
                                East problem could be solved easily if the occupied territories were
                                vacated by the aggressors. Kosygin said he felt that time had come
                                for the US and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to join their
                                efforts to achieve Israeli withdrawal. This could be done through
                                various contacts and through joint pressure on Israel. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> mission was, of course,
                                proceeding, but he was concerned it was becoming a routine
                                operation. If US and Soviets did what he was suggesting, the canal
                                could be opened and other elements of the problem resolved. His
                                impression was that some people in the US wanted the Middle East
                                tension to continue. While he did not want to mention any names, the
                                Soviets did have some information about attitudes in the US. Thus,
                                Israeli withdrawal from occupied territories was required. The US
                                and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> should join their efforts
                                to this end, and he wanted me to convey this to the President.
                                Kosygin continued that the Soviets are very concerned about the
                                Middle East situation. On the other hand, while saying it did not
                                want continued tension in the area, the US is doing nothing about
                                removing it. For example, the US did not seem to be concerned about
                                the plight of Arab refugees. If roots of <pb n="124" xml:id="pg_124"
                                    facs="0152"/>conflict were removed, i.e., if the problem of
                                occupied territories were resolved, other things, including the
                                question of armaments, would fall in place. What the US was raising
                                were subordinate questions, although Soviets knew that US is helping
                                Israel.</item>

                            <item>I said I would inform President of Kosygin's remarks. Noting that
                                origins of present situation are well known, I said I saw no need to
                                discuss them again at this time. Stressing our concern about the
                                situation, however, I pointed out the President's restraint in his
                                discussions with the Israeli Prime Minister was an effort to help
                                the <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> mission and

                                that a successful solution of the problem could be achieved. I also
                                pointed out that the problem involved not only question of occupied
                                territories, but also status of Israel, refugees, etc.</item>

                                question of occupied territories were resolved, i.e., if troops

                        attitudes and hope for something significant to happen, perhaps January
                        25th. <persName corresp="#p_EE1">Evron</persName>'s telegram said the
                        specifics were not available. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName>
                        said he very interested this possibility. Referring to his conversation with
                            <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> on the 22nd, he said was
                        somewhat discouraged since Arabs seemingly maintaining hard and fast
                        position that first step towards settlement <pb n="125" xml:id="pg_125"
                            facs="0153"/>must be Israel's withdrawal to June 4th lines. <persName
                            corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> had emphasized to <persName
                            corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> that the November resolution
                        contained seven or eight provisions, that no priorities had been established
                        by that resolution, and that it disappointing that Arabs refused discuss
                        anything except withdrawal. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName>
                        stated British interpretation that resolution to be taken as a whole and
                        that unilateral action not required of anybody. <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                            >Jarring</persName> felt he could only succeed in his mission by
                        personal contact, that he does not regard himself as an itinerant salesman
                        and there no hope unless procedural problems can be sorted out so that
                        negotiations will in fact take place. <persName corresp="#p_EA1"
                            >Eban</persName> said he suggested possibility secret emissaries proceed
                        to <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>'s Cyprus headquarters but
                            <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> thought that procedure
                        premature. <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> said there three
                        possibilities, (1) he could conclude the parties too far apart for any
                        progress and report failure to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, (2)
                        one side might change its position, or (3) some kind of negotiations could
                        continue to be sought. So far <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>
                        still prepared to keep at it in hope latter alternative materializes.</p>

                        on the harder ones. The other notes his refusal to describe himself as a
                        mediator or to propose solutions himself. One feels he is beginning to bore
                        in; the other talks of “stalemate” and “impasse.”</p>

                    <p>The difficulty with <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>'s method is
                        that he is running out of gap-fillers. If he can win Israeli acceptance of
                        the resolution, he will have climbed his first range of mountains. That
                        would increase the flow of ideas, at least from the Arabs. However, he would
                        still have one more procedural obstacle to handle-the mechanics of
                        talks.</p>
                    <p>The main question for us is how to encourage the parties to move from the
                        general to the specific without pushing either them or <persName
                            corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> too hard. This depends in part on
                        whether we believe <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> will come
                        out of his shell or will remain essentially a telephone booth. How much
                        perseverance he has, we just don't know yet.</p>
                    <p>My own feeling is that he is digging in gradually and that we owe him a
                        little more time. That doesn't mean we can't weigh in on obvious issues like
                        Israeli acceptance of the resolution, and we must go ahead with our

                            in fact we had no part in them. In the perspective of Egypt's good

                            rebuild, it would be wise now officially to make it clear that the
                            charges of American and British involvement were based on mistakes and
                            misinformation. <gloss target="#t_UARG1">UARG</gloss> should realize
                            that American people saw and heard spokesmen for Egypt repeat these
                            accusations daily on TV and radio and that these accusations have done a
                            great deal of harm to our mutual interests.

                            recent discussions with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SHM1"
                                >Symmes</persName>. I want to confirm his assurances of our support
                            for Jordan in meeting the problems that confront Your Excellency's

                            manifests the support which my Government has consistently provided to
                            the Kingdom. While I know I need not dwell on the high regard which
                            President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> has for His
                            Majesty King <persName>Hussein</persName>, underlying those friendly
                            ties between the leaders of our two countries is a strong fabric of
                            friendship between Jordanian and American officials as well as the
                            private citizens of our two countries. The recent Arab-Israel
                            hostilities have created problems in our relations, but these are not
                            insurmountable and are, in fact, being overcome.</item>

                        <item>By now you are aware of our decision to resume arms shipments to
                            Jordan. We are now negotiating a PL-480 program for Jordan. We are
                            continuing our technical assistance programs and are anxious to assist
                            Jordan in aggressively pursuing its economic development program. These
                            actions constitute concrete evidence of our firm intention to continue
                            our traditional policy toward Jordan.</item>

                        <item>In this connection, I regret the interpretations that may have been
                            placed on the discontinuance of budgetary support at this particular
                            time. Let me assure you that our decision was based solely on fiscal
                            considerations, i.e., pledges of Arab financial assistance for Jordan
                            reached at the Khartoum Conference, other contributions received by
                            Jordan, and Jordan's very strong foreign exchange position. Congress has
                            cut back our foreign aid resources and we would jeopardize our other
                                <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> programs to Jordan if we were to
                            provide budget support that does not appear to be currently needed. As

                            <persName corresp="#p_SHM1">Symmes</persName> has confirmed to Your
                            Excellency, we continue our interest in Jordan's financial well being
                            and are prepared to review your Government's budgetary situation
                            whenever you consider that such a review is warranted.</item>

                        <item>The major problem in the area is the establishment of a peace which is
                            just and lasting. Its achievement is of critical importance to all of
                            us, and both of our countries are dedicated to this goal. Let there be
                            no doubt, Your Excellency, that our efforts in this regard have been and
                            will continue to be unremitting. We welcome as a first step the Security
                            Council's adoption on November 22 of the resolution under which <gloss

                                <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>'s mission provides an
                            opportunity to work toward settlement which is not likely to recur. It
                            is of great importance that the parties make the most of this
                            opportunity by cooperating energetically and with as much flexibility as
                            possible in the negotiating process.</item>

                        <item>The United States, for its part, is fully committed to supporting
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>'s efforts.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> said in the
                            Security Council on November 22 ‘the diplomatic and political influence
                            of the United States Government will be exerted in support of the United
                            Nations Special Representative to achieve a fair, equitable and
                            dignified settlement so that all in the area can live in peace, security
                            and tranquility.’ Jordan can count on the United States to do all it can
                            to further a just and reasonable settlement. We are deeply conscious of
                            the importance which the two issues of Jerusalem and the West Bank have
                            for Jordan. When King <persName>Hussein</persName> recently visited the
                            United States, we explained to him our position on these problems. Our
                            policy on this has not changed.</item>

                        <item>Your Excellency and your Cabinet colleagues have done much to help

                            of the Middle Eastern situation. I have noted in particular the actions
                            your Government has taken in seeking to prevent terrorism and in
                            encouraging the resumption of normal activities on the West Bank, such
                            as the operation of schools and commercial traffic.</item>
                        <label>9.</label>
                        <item>I am keenly aware of the many serious problems facing Your Excellency
                            and the Kingdom as a whole, including the major one of alleviating the
                            tragic plight of the refugees. My Government has, of course, continued
                            its very substantial contributions to meet the more recent emergency
                            situation. We have also supported the United Nations General Assembly
                            and Security Council actions on this problem that were taken during
                            recent months. These included resolutions calling upon the Government of
                            Israel to facilitate the return of those inhabitants who had fled
                            following the outbreak of hostilities, resolutions which we continue to
                            believe must be implemented to the fullest extent possible. We have
                            repeatedly made clear to all concerned, both <pb n="132" xml:id="pg_132"
                                facs="0160"/>publicly and privately, our position on the ‘new
                            refugees’, as well as on the need for an overall solution to the refugee
                            problem. I can assure you that my Government remains dedicated to the
                            principle that a just settlement of the refugee problem should and must
                            be found. The present efforts to establish conditions of peace afford an
                            opportunity to come to grips with this problem at last.</item>

                        <item>In closing, let me say that we recognize Your Excellency's appointment
                            as Prime Minister last October as a reaffirmation of the special
                            confidence that King <persName>Hussein</persName> has long placed in
                            your leadership. We continue to wish you success as Jordan grapples with

                    <p>The Israelis agreed via <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> to
                        allow the Egyptians to clear the southern half of the Canal enough to let 15
                        trapped ships out. The <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> is now pressing

                        provide information on the remaining obstacles in the Canal to permit Soviet
                        vessels in Port Said to transit the Canal and present Israel with a “fait

                    <p>He then said he believes Israel and the US have a common interest in keeping

                            the softest terms justifiable on economic grounds, since Israel is doing

                        just a bit more, we could more easily justify a move to 100% dollar sale
                        than being tight on quantities.</p>

                        <item>King feels he has gone “ninety percent of the way” with the US. After
                            June the US seemed to forget completely all that he and other moderate
                            Jordanians had done over past decade and more to help preserve stability
                            and moderation in Middle East. US had done nothing to help Jordan out
                            since June. To the contrary, we had in effect, voted against Jordan on
                            Jerusalem question; we had posed continuous difficulties about matters
                            of mere words in Security Council resolutions; we had finally lifted
                            arms embargo for Israel and certain other Arab states but pointedly
                            excluded Jordan; and then we had discontinued budgetary support which
                            had become symbol of our relationship. Although subsequently we had
                            affirmed our continued support of Jordan in general way, fact was that
                            totality of our actions toward Jordan had been negative rather than
                            positive. Finally, King's reception in US in November, particularly in
                            contrast to later reception of <persName corresp="#p_EL1"
                                >Eshkol</persName>, had been serious psychological blow.</item>

                            <persName corresp="#p_RZ1">Zaid</persName> explained that he separately

                                >Talhouni</persName> today had argued at some length with King to
                            effect he should accept US arms package, even if it provides only 50
                            percent of Jordan arms strength as of June 4. They had urged it would be
                            better go along with us in present situation because Soviet arms deal
                            would not contribute to solution Middle East problem and, in their view,
                            would further obstruct solution. King had pressed his own analysis in
                            paragraph 2 above in response to this advice.</item>

                        <item>In <persName corresp="#p_RZ1">Zaid</persName>'s view there is much to
                            what King says. He said he believes that if US arms package proves
                            inadequate in King's view, only way to keep King from going to Soviets
                            for arms is to be able to cite something tangible and dramatic to
                            indicate that US does have continuing positive interest in Jordan and
                            does in fact intend “use its muscle” to prevent Israelis from carrying
                            off a massive fait accompli. <persName corresp="#p_RZ1">Zaid</persName>
                            said that “statements without practical effect” simply are not enough.
                            Jordan must be able to point to something tangible to show that <gloss

                            exert pressure and point to results. In the past decade and more the
                            King felt that Jordan had given everything and gotten nothing in trying
                            to live with Israel. <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> had spoken a
                            great deal about human and legal rights in Viet Nam. What about Arab
                            rights? What about villages that had been levelled on West Bank by
                            Israel? What about people who had been evicted from their homes in Gaza,
                            Jerusalem, and West Bank? What about <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            decisions that had been consistently flouted? What about recent US
                            statements about not accepting unilateral Israeli actions? Fact is that
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> is accepting Israeli actions and
                            doing nothing about them.</item>

                                >Zaid</persName> emphasized that these are things King is thinking.
                            This is his reading of situation. Actually his advisers are trying
                            without much hope of success to convince him to make no drastic moves.
                            Yet, many Jordanians now believe the Soviets can call the tune in the
                            Middle East and the Mediterranean. They are beginning to believe the
                            Soviets [garble—are able?] to challenge the US Sixth Fleet in the Middle
                            East and that the Soviets also have Marines and helicopters to land in
                            Middle East if necessary. Thus, many Jordanians and other Arabs now see
                            a possibility of Security Council or other <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> action to face Israel with sanctions similar to those
                            that had been put on Israel in 1956 by the US. But in this case it would
                            be the Soviets that would take the credit for forcing the Israelis to
                            respect world opinion, not the US.</item>

                            actions. <persName corresp="#p_RZ1">Zaid</persName> counselled me
                            against seeing King but said he would let <persName>Hussein</persName>
                            know I was available whenever he wanted to see me. (I will in any case

                            late on sixth.) He thought it would be better for me not to see King
                            until <persName corresp="#p_KGA1">Khammash</persName> has returned with

                            Mission that could be cited as real evidence of US intentions to use its

                            than a gimmick. We need an earnest of our intentions with regard to
                            Jerusalem and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> resolution. Jordan
                            accepted the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> resolution and has
                            categorically stated this to <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                                >Jarring</persName>. Jordan is willing to make a public statement to

                            In my opinion even more important than giving

                            be a clearcut public statement with practical effect of our intentions

                            must emphasize that Jordanians immediately picked up and began to
                            suspect phrase “in spirit of” in reference to Israeli attitude toward

                        supply arms to Jordan thus making it more difficult for King to more towards
                        Soviet arms relationship. This statement would have to be to effect we have
                        decided satisfy legitimate requirements of Jordan because of our long and

                    <p>We have been giving careful study for some months past to the question of
                        Jerusalem, a “crunch” issue in any prospective settlement of the
                        Arab-Israeli dispute. Various Israeli statements and actions indicate a
                        closed mind on Jerusalem, although we cannot be sure how much Israel's
                        position may be tactical and how far it might be willing to recede as part
                        of a settlement package. But in any event we cannot passively accept
                        Israel's unilateral dominion over Old Jerusalem (actually the Old City plus
                        adjacent areas). To do so would ignore the interests <pb n="139"
                            xml:id="pg_139" facs="0167"/>of Jordan and of the traditional Arab
                        residents of Old Jerusalem, as well as the interests of the major
                        religions.</p>
                    <p>Our <gloss target="#t_IRG1">IRG</gloss> has considered a plan for the partial
                        internationalization of Old Jerusalem, and has agreed that if offers a

                    <p>What strikes me is not the familiar point about buying Soviet arms if we
                        can't meet Jordan's needs but the increasing Jordanian conviction that we
                        are bowing out of the Middle East and only the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                            >USSR</gloss> can bring justice to the Arabs.</p>
                    <p>We told our Arab friends last fall that, if they went along with a balanced

                        addition, they keep making their own changes in Jerusalem, either feeling
                        they have us in their pockets or discounting our view entirely. The Arabs
                        are beginning to believe that we aren't even trying to press Israel.</p>

                    <p>In addition, you should know that Generals <persName corresp="#p_HBGM1"
                            >Hod</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> had
                        a good series of talks. <persName corresp="#p_HBGM1">Hod</persName> went
                        back to Israel to do some homework and sent four of his officers back for
                        technical discussions. If any cover was needed, the negotiations for the
                        added Skyhawks provided it. Now General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1"
                            >Wheeler</persName> is waiting for the final answers he needs from
                            <persName corresp="#p_HBGM1">Hod</persName> to prepare the memo you
                        asked for following the <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName>

                    <p>One other point you should be aware of is that Secretary <persName

                        production line to the new one so as to slow the present one slightly but
                        complete delivery of all Skyhawks by January 1970. This means that 4 were
                        delivered in December; 28 will be delivered in 1968; 56 will be delivered in
                        1969 and January <pb n="143" xml:id="pg_143" facs="0171"/>1970. This pushes
                        16 originally scheduled for 1968 delivery into 1969, but the Israelis have
                        agreed.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_KGA1">Khammash</persName>, Chief of Staff of
                        the Jordan Arab Army, arrived in Washington on January 17 as a result of our
                        decision to resume arms deliveries in Jordan.</p>
                    <p>Since the June Arab-Israeli hostilities the Jordanians have pressed us to
                        resume arms shipments to make up at least part of the losses they suffered
                        in June. We were not responsive until January 7. You will recall that in
                        December in an oral message to you King <persName>Hussein</persName> agreed
                        that he would not purchase arms from the Soviet Union if the United States
                        would meet his legitimate defensive arms requirements.<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d71fn2">See <ref target="#d29fn3">footnote 3, Document
                            29</ref>.</note> Not having heard from us, the King decided that the
                        pressure for arms from his army was such that he could no longer resist
                        persistent Soviet offers of military equipment. As a result of our
                        Ambassador's intervention, <persName>Hussein</persName> postponed his
                        decision until General <persName corresp="#p_KGA1">Khammash</persName> could
                        determine in Washington what we are willing to do. Unless we can convince
                        the King that we are willing to resume our previous role of arms supplier to
                        Jordan, there is little doubt that, in his present critical situation, he
                        will turn to the Soviets for arms.</p>
                    <p>Upon his arrival, General <persName corresp="#p_KGA1">Khammash</persName>
                        presented us with a list of military requirements totalling approximately
                        $200 million. (The details are outlined in Tab A.)<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d71fn3">None of the tabs is printed.</note> We have met with him
                        periodically during the last two weeks to discuss his requirements and we
                        have explained to him our very serious problems in meeting them. He <pb
                            n="144" xml:id="pg_144" facs="0172"/>admitted that his requests were the
                        maximum. Because of the critical situation in which Jordan now finds itself
                        he maintains this list, which in fact exceeds Jordan's losses by a
                        substantial amount, is necessary to restore the morale of the armed forces.
                        It is apparent that he will stand on his original request until we make a
                        counter proposal.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KGA1">Khammash</persName> argues strongly that he must
                        go back with explicit assurances of resumed US support for the Jordan armed
                        forces; that he, <persName corresp="#p_KGA1">Khammash</persName>, has
                        continually assured his officers and men (based on discussions with us last
                        summer) that American help was coming, but that his assurances are wearing
                        dangerously thin; and that pressures on the King to meet arms needs, even
                        from the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> if necessary, are mounting.
                        Our Ambassador confirms this assessment. We have also had disturbing reports
                        of a deterioration in the internal security situation in Jordan.</p>
                    <p>It is clear that the very modest arms package we recommended to you in
                        December will not meet the political objectives we have set ourselves,
                        namely, (1) to shut off any further temptation on the part of the King to
                        accept Russian arms; (2) to increase the morale of the armed forces and
                        their loyalty to the King; (3) to increase his prestige and stature with
                        respect to his Arab neighbors; and (4) to strengthen
                            <persName>Hussein</persName> so that he can better carry out his role as
                        principal proponent of a settlement with Israel.</p>
                    <p>The principal problems presented by the <persName corresp="#p_KGA1"
                            >Khammash</persName> list, in addition to its size, are his requests for
                        tanks and aircraft. <persName corresp="#p_KGA1">Khammash</persName> wishes
                        to pursue his pre-war plan of standardizing on American tanks and phasing
                        out his British Centurions. He has asked for 200 M-48 A-4s with diesel
                        engines and 105mm guns. He has also asked for 36 “multi-purpose, versatile
                        jet aircraft.”</p>
                    <p>Both the tanks and the aircraft are troublesome because of their high cost
                        and relatively large numbers, and because we would then be almost the sole
                        supplier of major equipment items for Jordan. The problems with Israel would
                        be increased if we agreed to supply Jordan with tanks with 105mm guns as
                        opposed to the 90mm guns with which their present tanks are equipped.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Recommendations</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>We have put together a counter proposal which we recommend that our
                        negotiator offer to <persName corresp="#p_KGA1">Khammash</persName>. The
                        details of this proposal are at Tab B. In essence, we would: (a) Agree to
                        deliver ground force items suspended after the war. These are a combination
                        of cash sales and prior year grant <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> items
                        totalling about $10 million. There are no major items of consequence
                        included. (b) Make up Jordan's war losses not included in (a) with the
                        exception of heavy artillery and some of the tanks. (c) Offer 88 M-48s
                        instead of 200-and without the larger <pb n="145" xml:id="pg_145"
                            facs="0173"/>105mm gun, and (d) Agree to go ahead with our F-104
                        contract by selling 18 F-104s now and, subject to certain conditions,
                        consider a second 18 aircraft at some point in the future. We would plan
                        deliveries and financing over two and a half fiscal years; actual deliveries
                        after 1968 would be subject to an annual review of Jordan's military
                        requirements, taking into consideration the political and economic situation
                        then prevailing and particularly progress towards an Arab-Israeli settlement
                        and progress of efforts towards arms limitations in the area. The
                        considerations which would be the subject of the annual reviews are at Tab
                        D.</p>
                    <p>The installation for the first fiscal year would cost approximately $32
                        million in cash sales for both ground and air force items. Of this amount,
                        $10 million has already been paid under the previously concluded F-104
                        contract. The installment for the second fiscal year would cost
                        approximately $36.3 million while the third would be $10.3 million. The
                        estimated cost of the total program would be approximately $49 million for
                        ground force items and $33 million for air force items, a total of $82
                        million inclusive of shipping and related charges—a substantial reduction
                        from the cost of his request. About $3.8 million of this would be in prior
                        year grant <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> and the balance in cash
                        sales. Jordan can pay cash for the 1968 tranche; neither we nor they can
                        promise anything definite about availability of funds thereafter. We believe
                        cash sales will cause less opposition in Congress than credit sales. (See
                        financial summary at Tab C.)</p>
                    <p>We propose the F-104 aircraft for the following reasons: (a) By resuming arms
                        shipments to Jordan we are in effect placing it in the category of countries
                        for whom we selectively lifted our arms suspension on 23 October. The
                        suspension for Jordan specifically included the F-104's, and we would thus
                        be doing for Jordan now what we did for the other “moderates” last October.
                        (b) Jordan has on deposit $10 million against the F-104 contract. Spares,
                        ground support and other equipment were shipped to Jordan prior to June.
                        Twelve aircraft are currently in storage awaiting delivery. Some Jordanian
                        pilots and technicians have been trained and others are now in training, and
                        (c) the delivery time for the F-104 is almost immediate. If the morale of
                        the armed forces is the key political factor in our aid to Jordan, they
                        should have on their airfields some US planes as soon as possible.</p>
                    <p>We could put to <persName corresp="#p_KGA1">Khammash</persName> a counter
                        proposal which included 18 F-104's but excludes any tanks, making him meet
                        his tank requirements in Great Britain. We consulted the British last week
                        and they could make available their Centurion tank at a price comparable to
                        our M48A1, in quantities of up to 200, with deliveries beginning in six
                        months. They could, in about two years, upgun these Centurions to 105mm.</p>
                    <pb n="146" xml:id="pg_146" facs="0174"/>
                    <p>This proposal is not, however, likely to meet Jordan's minimum requirements;
                        Jordan would want at least a partial fulfillment of its tank needs from
                        American sources. Part of their reasoning is military: they now have a
                        mixture of American and British tanks, but very few of the latter are in
                        operable condition. It would be less expensive and more efficient to
                        standardize, at least for their two armored brigades, on American tanks. An
                        offer of about 88 US M48A1 tanks would permit them to equip their two
                        brigades with American tanks. (Their total inventory of American tanks would
                        then be 181, 64 less than pre-war.) The more important reason is political.
                        Tanks are the most important element of their ground forces and consequently
                        they want them to be American, as evidence of our continued support.</p>
                    <p>The King's mood is one of increasing frustration. In spite of his efforts,
                        there has been no significant progress towards a settlement. His army is the
                        only one in the area which has not been substantially re-equipped since the
                        June war. The King wants the assurance of continued American support which
                        our supply of major military items would imply. Given our traditional close
                        relationship with Jordan, <persName>Hussein</persName>'s demise or his
                        acceptance of Soviet arms would be a serious blow to US prestige and
                        interests in the area and would be interpreted as a significant Soviet
                        victory.</p>
                    <p>In the circumstances, we recommend that you approve the recommendation below.
                        If you approve, the Secretary of Defense will present this proposal to

                        (1) whether you are now ready to go ahead with a substantial program; and
                        (2) if so, how to handle the difficult Conte-Long amendments.<note n="4"

                                <hi rend="italic">The package</hi> contains 18 F-104 aircraft, 88
                                M-48 A-1 tanks, medium artillery and a range of support equipment.
                                This $82 million (<gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1968-<gloss
                                    target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1970) package contrasts to
                                    <persName>Hussein</persName>'s $200 million request, which
                                included 36 aircraft and 200 M-48 A-4 tanks. Our rationale for
                                paring his request is to help replace war losses except for some
                                planes and tanks and heavy artillery. We would have to be willing to
                                consider something beyond this package later but would suggest
                                starting with this.</p>
                            <p>Our paring may leave this too little to meet what
                                    <persName>Hussein</persName> considers his needs. He lost 179
                                tanks in June, and we are offering half that. He wants tanks with a
                                diesel engine (greater range) and a 105 mm. gun (which we sold the
                                Israelis). We couldn't supply what he wants for two years. Our plane
                                offer has a better chance, since we would just pick up our 1966
                                contract where it was suspended but offer half the number of planes
                                now.</p>
                            <p>Our two hopes for flexibility are (a) that he can get British tanks
                                to his specifications much sooner (they're available) and (b) that
                                he might take some British aircraft if the Saudis would give them
                                and we would supply a few more tanks instead. But the Secretaries
                                feel we have to offer to supply both if neither of these deals works
                                out.</p>
                            <p>Jordan could pay cash for the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1968
                                installment (about $32 million, of which $10 million already paid
                                under the 1966 contract). The <pb n="148" xml:id="pg_148"
                                    facs="0176"/>cost in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1969
                                would be $36.3 million and in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1970
                                $10.3 million. Neither <persName corresp="#p_KGA1"
                                    >Khammash</persName> nor the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                                yet knows definitely how the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1968
                                and <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1969 tranches might be
                                financed, so we would have to feel our way.</p>
                            <p>This package will be painful to approve, but the alternative is
                                accepting the probable consequences of not going ahead now.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName> acknowledged to you
                                that he wished no one had to give arms to Jordan but he'd rather see
                                us there than the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_DM1">Dayan</persName> in a published interview on
                                January 19 said: “We shall not profit by it in any way if the
                                Americans lose their influence in Jordan.”</p>
                            <p>I should hate to see this presented to you simply as selling arms to
                                block Soviet military aid, because the issue is now much broader. We
                                have reached the point in Jordan where the question is whether they
                                think they have a better chance of achieving their objectives with
                                US or Soviet help. If we are ending our aid relationship and are
                                unable to press Israel toward a settlement, then
                                    <persName>Hussein</persName> is wondering whether a Soviet ring
                                around Israel wouldn't better bring Israel to terms. This is, of
                                course, the thinking of an increasingly desperate man who sees his
                                choices diminishing. It would just about end chances for the kind of
                                settlement we'd like.</p>
                            <p>There are other things we must do on the diplomatic front such as
                                presenting a clearer position on Jerusalem and helping get the
                                    <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> exercise moving.
                                But unfortunately, this military aid decision has become a symbol to
                                Hussein. We have strung him along since last June, and <persName
                                    corresp="#p_KGA1">Khammash</persName> has been here since
                                January 17. Now <persName>Hussein</persName> has told you he would
                                continue to avoid Soviet arms if he could be sure of meeting his
                                legitimate needs in the US. That is the purpose of this
                                exercise.</p>

                            <p>The <hi rend="italic">Conte-Long amendments</hi> require you to
                                withhold aid from Jordan in an amount equal to its expenditure for

                                Jordanian purchases are “vital to the national security of the
                                United States.” The airplanes, the tanks, and the howitzers in this
                                package are pretty clearly sophisticated <pb n="149" xml:id="pg_149"

                                eliminate all economic aid to Jordan for at least the next two
                                years.</p>
                            <p>It would be possible to weave a complicated legal argument which
                                might allow you to maintain aid without a waiver. But it would be
                                very dubious and would certainly cause serious trouble on the Hill.
                                Therefore, <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and <persName

                            <p>This will be the first use of the waiver provision. I think the

                                checking done on the Hill. I don't think we should seek agreement
                                from Conte, Fulbright, Morse, Church and the others most interested
                                in this topic, but you may want to be able to say that you notified
                                them beforehand. (The law requires you to make formal notification
                                of waiver to the Congress within 30 days.)</p>

                            rend="italic">farewell call on the President</hi> yesterday by
                        expressing his appreciation for the honor of having worked with the
                        President and of having represented his country in the United <pb n="150"
                            xml:id="pg_150" facs="0178"/>States for this past eight years. He thanks
                        the President for his understanding.</p>
                    <p>The President responded by saying he had Israel's deepest interests at heart.
                        The President said he felt this deeply and personally. If at any time we
                        reached different conclusions it was because of our different viewpoints
                        rather than because of any lack of interest in Israel's future.</p>
                    <p>The President went on to express his deep concern over the odds working
                        against Israel. He knew the Israeli people were superior in ability to their
                        neighbors, but he feared they might not be superior to the Soviets. The
                        President recalled how the Soviets had poured arms into the Arab countries
                        after the war. He said he was not sure what Soviet intentions were. He had
                        thought after talking to Premier Kosygin that they wanted to live at peace
                        with us, and now after the summer of arms shipments into the Mid-East and
                        events in North Korea, he was not so sure.</p>
                    <p>The President said, however, that he could not afford to give up hope. He had
                        agreed with Premier Kosygin to talk about the Middle East and nothing has
                        happened. Kosygin has moved on the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>, and
                        the President hopes something can be done to achieve arms limitation in the
                        Mid-East. He is not confident, but he can not afford to give up hope. He
                        intends to make every effort to reach some sort of understanding before he
                        makes any more decisions on aircraft. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA1"
                            >Harman</persName> nodded his understanding.</p>
                    <p>In the context of discussing Soviet penetration of the Middle East, the
                        President said, “I am going to do something for Jordan. I told your Prime
                        Minister that and I am just going to have to go ahead.” Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_HA1">Harman</persName> again nodded his understanding.</p>
                    <p>Of <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, the President said he had
                        come into office with the hope of getting along with the Egyptian
                        leadership. He had found, however, that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                            >Nasser</persName> was unreliable, untrustworthy, and undependable. He
                        hoped we could achieve some sort of working relationship but did not know
                        exactly what we could work out.</p>
                    <p>The President described the problem created for him by the depth of
                        opposition in the United States to our extensive international commitments.
                        The President suggested that what the Israeli Ambassador and his Minister
                        ought to be doing is to tell their American friends at every turn that the
                        United States cannot play a responsible role in the world if they pull out
                        on obligations like Vietnam. The President said he didn't see how Americans
                        could live with their consciences unless they met these obligations around
                        the world, but he was having a very difficult time persuading many Americans
                        on that point. He said many Americans believe that our problems would end if
                        we got out of Vietnam, but he knew it “wouldn't be 24 hours before we faced
                        new ones.”</p>

                    <p>The Ambassador said a few kind words about his successor. The President said
                        that he did not know how the Israelis could improve on Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_HA1">Harman</persName>'s work but that he looked forward to
                        working with General <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> and said
                        he would find the President just as receptive as Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_HA1">Harman</persName> had.</p>
                    <p>He told Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Harman</persName> that he liked
                        all the Israelis he knew. He was fond of <persName corresp="#p_EL1"
                            >Eshkol</persName> and liked to do business with him. He would not like
                        to do anything to hurt his feelings. Then he said he would like to see
                            <persName corresp="#p_DM1">Moshe Dayan</persName> when he visited the
                        United States, but did not know how to do it without hurting Prime Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName>'s feelings. Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Harman</persName> said that, with the
                        President's permission, he would see whether he could do something to ease
                        the President's problem. The President reiterated that he fully understood
                            <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName>'s sensitivities on this
                        subject and would have the same ones if their positions were reversed. But
                        he, the President, would like to know as many Israeli leaders past, present
                        or future as possible.</p>
                    <p>In parting, the President asked the Ambassador to take his warm wishes to
                        Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Harman</persName>. He also asked the
                        Ambassador to tell Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_EL1"
                            >Eshkol</persName>, “I may not worry as much as Prime Minister <persName
                            corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName> does about Israel, but I worry as
                        deeply.”</p>

                        understood that discussions on mechanics were going on and simply expressed
                        his view that resumption of relations would be a good thing for both of us.
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> agreed but said he would
                        need a little time to inform the other Arab states of his intentions. He
                        said it would be a little harder to resume relations with the US than it had
                        been with the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> because we have not made the

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> expressed his admiration
                        for the King which General <persName corresp="#p_KGA1">Khammash</persName>
                        said was reciprocated; Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                        also apologized for the length of time that the General had been kept
                        waiting in the United States and General <persName corresp="#p_KGA1"
                            >Khammash</persName> indicated that he understood why. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> invited the General to expose his
                        views on the situation in Jordan.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_KGA1">Khammash</persName> made reference to the
                        enormous pressure under which the King is now living, including the division
                        of the country and almost daily clashes on the border, and he alluded to the
                        restlessness of the Jordanian army. He hoped that what would be offered him
                        would be something the King could approve. But he was worried <pb n="154"
                            xml:id="pg_154" facs="0182"/>about the results if the King did not
                        because he considers that this mission is the last chance the King will give
                        him in the United States. He asked for help and made the point that the
                        maximum good political effect will flow from the rapid arrival in his
                        country of arms from the U.S. He asked in this connection concerning air
                        shipment of some items and the possible negotiability of the package.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary of Defense made clear that General <persName corresp="#p_KGA1"
                            >Khammash</persName>'s original list of items was for us a very tough
                        one and would cause us most serious problems with the Congress. He pointed
                        out also that Jordan and the U.S. have the same basic objective of stable
                        relations between countries of the area and that this was an objective which
                        would not primarily be met by arms. We are limited in what we can do with
                        respect to arms particularly because of the need to justify supplying arms
                        to both Jordan and Israel just after they have had a war. Also there is the
                        problem of diversion of resources from economic development which the
                        purchase of arms causes.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> then briefly outlined
                        what we could do: <list>
                            <label>1.</label>

                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>We propose an annual review of the problem. In the course of such
                                an annual review we could consider the possibility some time in the
                                future of 18 more such aircraft.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>We would ship the suspended <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>

                            <item>The remaining ground equipment from past sales (both of these
                                could be shipped at an early date by sea).</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>

                                <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> then pointed
                                    out that we had gotten some very recent information from the
                                    British on the availability of Centurions, specifically, that if
                                    200 were really what Jordan needed, they could be bought in
                                    Britain, that the spares and ammunition were available-and would
                                    be available well into the 70's—that they could be converted to
                                    105mm guns in Jordan. General <persName corresp="#p_KGA1"
                                        >Khammash</persName>'s lack of interest in tanks from the
                                    British, however described, was clear. Mr. <persName
                                        corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> then responded that
                                    we could only make available 88 M48A1s (and this number was
                                    inserted in the draft Memorandum of Understanding<note n="2"

                                        corresp="#p_KGA1">Khammash</persName> took with him).</p>
                                <p>General <persName corresp="#p_KGA1">Khammash</persName> expressed
                                    a strong need for 7 to 10 155mm guns which he had lost during
                                    the war and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                                    promised to see what we could do for him in this respect.<note

                                here. He said that we would need $22 million, in addition to the $10

                    </p>
                    <p>When General <persName corresp="#p_KGA1">Khammash</persName> asked what
                        negotiating latitude there was on the planes, Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> replied that in our opinion the
                        F-104 is a good plane for Jordan and that others are either not available,
                        or not as applicable to Jordan's requirements as the F-104.</p>
                    <p>He said, in response to the General's question, that a Presidential
                        Determination under the Conte-Long Amendment would not change the type of
                        plane which we are considering. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1"
                            >McNamara</persName> did say, however, that, once the 18 F-104s are
                        delivered, we could consider some time in the future another 18. As to the
                        negotiating flexibility of other items Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1"
                            >McNamara</persName> said that, as to tanks, this depended on the
                        acceptability of British tanks. On other items, there was some but not much
                        because of financial considerations.</p>
                    <p>Finally, the Secretary of Defense suggested that General <persName
                            corresp="#p_KGA1">Khammash</persName> take the draft Memorandum of
                        Understanding with him, ask us any questions he had, and then present it to
                        the King. He pointed out that it could be signed in Jordan by our Ambassador
                        if General <persName corresp="#p_KGA1">Khammash</persName> wished to avoid
                        making another trip to the United States.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_KGA1">Khammash</persName> thanked the Secretary
                        for all the work that had been done in his behalf and said he would now see
                        what he could do with the King.</p>

                    <p>You are authorized to deliver the following letter from the President to King
                        Hussein. <hi rend="italic">Begin text</hi>, “His Majesty, King
                            <persName>Hussein</persName>, Amman, <pb n="156" xml:id="pg_156"
                            facs="0184"/>Jordan. Your Majesty: I send you this personal word in
                        advance of the report General <persName corresp="#p_KGA1"
                            >Khammash</persName> will give you. The General has argued your case
                        well.</p>
                    <p>Our two countries have enjoyed a warm, close, mutually beneficial
                        relationship for a long period. There are few other countries in the world
                        with which we have worked as closely as with Jordan. I assure Your Majesty
                        that it is our policy and our interest to continue that relationship and our
                        support of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. While the June war has created
                        strains and problems for both of us, it has never altered our fundamental
                        policy towards Jordan.</p>
                    <p>Despite the current heavy demands on our resources, General <persName
                            corresp="#p_KGA1">Khammash</persName> is returning with an arms package
                        which we consider to be a substantial response to your request for us to
                        meet your legitimate arms requirements. We intend this package to be a
                        strong reaffirmation of our support.</p>
                    <p>I also assure you that we have not altered our firm resolve to extend our
                        full diplomatic and political support of Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> to reach a just and durable
                        settlement in the Middle East. During your visit here in November, we
                        explained to you our position on the West Bank and Jerusalem. We have not
                        changed that position. As Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                            >Jarring</persName> makes progress, we hope and expect that there will
                        be opportunities for us to support his efforts in more specific ways.</p>
                    <p>Your Majesty, we are both passing through a critical period in the history of
                        our two countries. With patience, wisdom and mutual trust, I am sure that we
                        can solve our problems and obtain the objective we both so fervently
                        desire-a peaceful Middle East in which a united Jordan can play its historic
                        role.</p>

                    <p>114277. 1. Please deliver following message from Secretary to Foreign
                        Minister <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName>:</p>
                    <p>“Dear Mr. Foreign Minister:</p>
                    <p>During Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName>'s recent
                        visit to the United States, he and President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1"
                            >Johnson</persName> agreed that it would be useful if you and I
                        consulted on specific steps which our governments might take to advance the
                        cause of peace. In the spirit of this agreement, I would like to review with
                        you at this time the status of the talks being conducted by Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>.</p>
                    <p>I believe that the essential thing in this current stage is to begin actual
                        negotiations on substantive issues, in a form acceptable to both sides, as
                        promptly as possible. Our strenuous efforts throughout the summer and fall
                        in the General Assembly and the Security Council had as a principal
                        objective the creation of conditions that would make such negotiations
                        possible.</p>
                    <p>I therefore noted with much interest the position which you gave to
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> on February 1.<note
                            n="2" xml:id="d79fn2">See <ref target="#d68fn4">footnote 4, Document
                                68</ref>.</note> Although it seemed to me this represented some
                        progress, I think it is only a partial step. I urge you to maintain the
                        momentum of this move by going one step further. Israel, in my view, would
                        risk nothing and would gain advantage by stating to <persName
                            corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> unequivocally that it accepts the
                        resolution as a whole in accordance with the interpretations put on it by
                        its sponsor, and on the understanding that the resolution will be
                        implemented through discussions under <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                            >Jarring</persName>'s auspices. I agree with your assessment that there
                        are varying views among the Arabs themselves, and I think it is important
                        through steps such as this to strengthen the position of those who advocate
                        peaceful negotiations.</p>
                    <p>As you know, there has in recent days been increasing talk among the Arabs to
                        the effect that the dispute should be returned to the Security Council or at
                        least that the question of Jerusalem should be raised in the Council. I fear
                        that for the Council to take up any aspect of the problem at this stage
                        would likely bring <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>'s mission
                        to a close. <pb n="159" xml:id="pg_159" facs="0187"/>This would have the
                        most serious implications for peace in the Middle East. In addition, as I am
                        sure you will agree, a Security Council session in such circumstances would
                        hold great difficulty for both our governments. It would be particularly
                        unfortunate if the question went to the Security Council in a situation in
                        which the Arabs were depicted as accepting the resolution and being prepared
                        to implement it, while Israel's position appeared to be ambiguous. The
                        positive results achieved in the November Security Council resolution would
                        be jeopardized as would the broad support and sympathy for Israel's
                        position. The possibility that the Arabs might take this course of action
                        makes it even more important that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                            >Jarring</persName> be able to show progress in his efforts.</p>
                    <p>Similarly, the possibility that the Arabs might return the issue to the
                        Security Council strengthens our conviction that great restraint is needed
                        in Israel's policies respecting Jerusalem. We have succeeded in persuading
                        the Jordanians, at least for now, not to raise Jerusalem in the Council. I
                        fear, however, that this possibility will continue to plague us so long as
                        your Government pursues policies and actions which increasingly foreclose
                        hopes that some meaningful accommodation on Jerusalem is possible in the
                        context of a peaceful settlement-an accommodation not only to the interests
                        of the international religious community, on which your Government has given
                        clear assurances, but to the interests of the Government of Jordan as
                        well.</p>
                    <p>I must in all frankness say that without such accommodation we seriously
                        doubt there can be a settlement. It was to underline our deep concern in
                        this matter that I recently asked Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BW1"
                            >Barbour</persName> to reiterate to you our views on the Jerusalem
                        question. I would not want to leave the impression that our position is
                        merely a formal one. I am firmly convinced that it goes to the heart of the
                        problem of achieving a settlement and would appreciate an indication from
                        you that your Government understands the depth of our concern.</p>
                    <p>I raise these matters with you in the interest of our common goal of a just
                        and lasting peace in the Middle East and in the spirit of frank
                        understanding which characterized Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_EL1"
                            >Eshkol</persName>'s recent talks with President <persName
                            corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>. Those talks dealt with the closely
                        related themes of peace and security. To assist Israel in its efforts to
                        achieve a satisfactory degree of military security we have, as you know,
                        recently agreed to increase the number of Skyhawk aircraft we are supplying
                        Israel above the number agreed to during the Prime Minister's visit. Now I
                        believe we must focus our attention on the search for peace, since it seems
                        clear to me that it is in this direction that the only true security for
                        Israel lies. This is my purpose in writing you today. I look forward to
                        having your thoughts on these and other ways in which our two countries can
                        contribute to the cause of peace.”</p>

                        connection you should make point that, if Jerusalem despite our best efforts
                        is again raised in the Security Council, it is by no means clear that <gloss

                                    prepared to negotiate on all matters included in the Security
                                    Council resolution which either side wished to raise. Our views
                                    on the problems of peace and our interpretation of the
                                    resolution were stated by me in the Security Council on November
                                    22, 1967.</item>
                                <item>(D) The Prime Minister of Israel, in a statement on January 8,
                                    indicated Israel's respect for the Security Council's resolution
                                    as an expression of the international interest in an agreed and
                                    final peace settlement. We now understand that the U.A.R. too is
                                    prepared to respect the Security Council's resolution and to
                                    establish a just and lasting peace, and for this purpose to
                                    discuss the resolution taken as a whole.</item>
                                <item>(E) The next step should be to bring the parties together. I
                                    refer to the agreement which I expressed to you on 14 February
                                    for the special representative of the Secretary-General to
                                    convene the two governments.</item>
                                <item>(F) We do not consider that accepted settlements of intricate
                                    problems can be reached by a procedure which avoids the
                                    establishment of contact. Apart from our views on the principle
                                    of negotiation, we cannot commit our most vital interests to an
                                    inefficient procedure.”</item>

                        <item>This, <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> said, was a statement
                            Israel was ready to defend before world opinion. Israel had used words
                            in this formulation it understood were necessary to get things moving:
                            “accept,” “respect,” “implement.” The essential element was agreement.
                            Israel could not return to 1957 type formulations. For Arabs the key
                            seemed to be “implementation;” very well, this was mentioned in the
                            Israeli statement. But we must always come back to idea of agreement.

                                aware that the US and Israel had departed from their common views.
                                The tone was not a tone of partnership; it seemed to suggest that
                                “we should all fall down and accept what the <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                                    >UAR</gloss> wants.” As a matter of fact, <persName
                                    corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> had said that Egypt was
                                doubtful about going back to the Security Council. “Our estimate is
                                that if this were to happen the Council would not draft a new
                                decalogue.” The point was that the US seemed to be trying to get
                                Israel to accept Egyptian formulas. At the same time, <persName
                                    corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> continued, the Israelis had
                                reports that Egypt was telling third parties that Egypt had been
                                given the understanding that the US was exercising pressure on
                                Israel. This was very disturbing and might explain why the Egyptians
                                had held out on the Israelis' February 1 formula.</p>

                            suggestions. Israel, he said, could not accept the November 22 <gloss

                            it by its principal sponsors.” One of the sponsors, the <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, was notably “wobbly” of late, though it
                            seemed to be trying to get back on firmer ground. Israel had to
                            interpret the resolution as it understood it and Egypt could accept or
                            reject this interpretation as it wanted. Israel had had enough bad
                            historical experience along this line. Besides, <persName

                            idea; with each side quoting its own interpretative authority, he could
                            get caught in the middle of a dispute between the powers, which he
                            clearly wanted to avoid.</item>

                        <item>I told the Foreign Minister that I thought there had been a

                                >Sisco</persName>'s views and I reviewed with him State 114278 (we
                            have not yet received a report of the Davies-Evron conversation). We
                            were concerned that the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and even
                            Jordan was making hay in the world's capitals out of the continuing
                            Israeli refusal to accept the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> res. The
                            Arabs have told us that the Israelis were playing with words: right or
                            wrong, their arguments were cogent to a degree. Our apprehensions re
                            Jordan were heightened by the fact that the factual situation regarding
                            Jerusalem, of such concern to them, was being eroded. We were concerned
                            about a return of Middle East problems to the Security Council where, as
                                <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> put it, the Arabs would
                            try to re-write history, where the pressure of shifting world opinion
                            would make it difficult to achieve a resolution as favorable as that of
                            November 22. Eban expressed the doubt, as he was to do again later in
                            the conversation, that the Arabs would take affairs to the Security
                            Council again. I assured the Minister that we were not buying the Arab
                            line but I reiterated our concern about world opinion and our desire to
                            avoid Israel's being in an indefensible posture if there is another

                        <item>Later, with <persName corresp="#p_RG1">Rafael</persName>, I asked
                            where Jordan stood in all of this. He said that <persName

                            attend a <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> convened meeting,
                            then Jordan would follow immediately. Jordan did not feel it could move
                            first but it certainly did not want to be left behind. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RG1">Rafael</persName> said that the <gloss

                            formula. The Israelis had asked him also suggest that the Jordanians
                            look a little more closely at the Israeli agenda for talks originally
                            presented and rejected by Jordan. There [were listed items?], for the
                            Jordanian interests in Jerusalem in addition to interests of religious
                            authorities. <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>, he said, was
                            glad to have this. <persName corresp="#p_RG1">Rafael</persName> went on
                            to ruminate that if the Jordanians thought this was a good time to take
                            the Israelis to the Security Council under conditions favorable to
                            Jordan, they were mistaken. There was great pressure in Israel,
                                <persName corresp="#p_RG1">Rafael</persName> said, to take care of
                            Israel's current security problems along the Jordan border on strictly
                            military terms. He hoped Jordan would not try to seek a political
                            advantage through Security Council action.</item>

                            package is that as it stands it is insufficient in terms of quantities

                            corresponding changes he wishes incorporated into our draft memorandum

                            King also indicated he will reluctantly have to consider other sources
                            if we cannot go further to meet his politico-military needs.</item>

                        <item>King <persName>Hussein</persName> asked I call late on the thirteenth.
                            As I expected, he wanted to discuss the arms package which he had spent
                            most of day discussing with General <persName corresp="#p_KGA1"
                                >Khammash</persName> and various other <gloss target="#t_GOJ1"

                                >Hassan</persName> and General <persName corresp="#p_KGA1"
                                >Khammash</persName> were present throughout our

                        <item>King began by expressing warm thanks for President's letter (State
                                113645)<note n="3" xml:id="d82fn3">
                                <ref target="#d77">Document 77</ref>.</note> and said he would be
                            responding in similar spirit. He also expressed thanks for time and
                            attention given to General <persName corresp="#p_KGA1"
                                >Khammash</persName> during his talks in Washington and for
                            opportunities for <persName corresp="#p_KGA1">Khammash</persName> to
                            discuss Jordan's problems with key US officials. He then said he was
                            quite disappointed that length of time and nature of discussions had not
                            produced a more acceptable package in terms of his political and
                            military needs. If package brought by General <persName
                                corresp="#p_KGA1">Khammash</persName> represented best we could do,
                            he was still faced with question whether it was not in Jordan's best
                            interest to seek arms from another source. He hoped that he would not
                            have to go to that other source because he still did not consider it to
                            be in Jordan's long-term interest, nor for that matter in the interest
                            of the US. Nevertheless, fact remained that arms package that had been
                            brought back by <persName corresp="#p_KGA1">Khammash</persName> did not
                            satisfactorily meet Jordan's political and military requirements.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>The King then specified deficiencies in terms of quantities and
                            delivery dates. He first laid great stress on insufficient number of
                            tanks included in package. He referred to fact we had said we were in
                            general replacing losses suffered by <gloss target="#t_JAA1">JAA</gloss>
                            in June hostilities. Jordan has lost 152 American tanks of which 124
                            were M48s and the remainder M47s. Yet we were offering Jordan only 88
                            M48 tanks to make up this loss. These 152 tanks were apart from the
                            Centurion tanks that had been lost. The King noted bitterly that 142 of
                            the American tanks lost by Jordan are now in service in Israeli Army. He
                            then pointed out various other increased quantities of ground equipment
                            needed by Jordan. He emphasized need for more anti-aircraft capability
                            in terms of morale factors and deterrent effects, but it was clear tanks
                            were his chief concern.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>
                            <persName>Hussein</persName> said that apart from failure of package to
                            meet Jordan's “legitimate requirements” in terms of quantities, proposed
                            delivery dates also greatly disturbed him because they failed to meet
                            Jordan's <pb n="169" xml:id="pg_169" facs="0197"/>political and military
                            needs. He noted that other Arab countries have already made up their
                            losses, whereas our proposed delivery dates, offered eight months after
                            the June war, extend into US fiscal year 1970. He said memo of
                            understanding provided no assurance that significant amounts of ground
                            equipment would arrive in Jordan in 1968. He had no idea of when tanks,
                            which were so important for morale, would begin to arrive.</item>
                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>Moving to aircraft, the King at first said that he did not want F104s
                            under any conditions, and he asked to have 18 A4 Skyhawks substituted
                            for 18 F104s. After some discussion, however, he said that he wanted to
                            reconsider that part of the package for at least a further 24 hours to
                            make up his mind as to what he should do about aircraft. His main
                            complaint about the F104s was that they are no longer suitable for
                            Jordan's needs. I pointed out the local and area political impact as
                            well as the morale significance that deliveries of some F104s by June
                            1968 might have and the fact that his pilots are already well down the
                            road in their training. I suggested that introduction of any other type
                            of aircraft at this stage, whether US or non-US, would pose unknown
                            delivery and training delays. It was after he had reflected on this that
                            he said he wanted to reserve his position with regard to aircraft for
                            another 24 hours.<note n="4" xml:id="d82fn4">

                                3420 from Amman, February 14, that the King reaffirmed his interest
                                in obtaining Skyhawk aircraft rather than F-104s. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_SHM1">Symmes</persName> noted that one of the
                                reasons the Jordanians were interested in the Skyhawks was because
                                it was the same aircraft recently supplied to Israel. <persName

                                endeavored to find out how anxious the Jordanians were to receive
                                aircraft in the near term. He asked for an estimate of how long it
                                would take to meet Jordan's request for Skyhawks. (National Archives

                        <item>Finally, the King had a number of editorial revisions that he wished
                            made in the memorandum of understanding. Most of these, he emphasized,
                            related to his concern in event of publicity, to appearing to have tied
                            his hands. He said he particularly wanted to avoid being put in a
                            position of potential embarrassment vis-a-vis other Arab states and with
                            his own people if the memo of understanding should ever become public.
                            In any case, he said, he probably would be forced to show the memo of
                            understanding to some of the other Arab countries providing funds to
                            Jordan-with obvious results. He then handed me his copy of the memo of
                            understanding and requested I transfer his interlineations to my

                            me that it represented a very substantial meeting of his stated military

                            to sign the agreement and that I thought it would be important to move
                            ahead now on the arms package in order to obtain the political benefits
                            I saw coming from his acceptance of the package. For example, the morale
                            of his army could be improved immediately. Moving ahead quickly with the
                            package would enable him to ask now for the evacuation of Saudi and
                            Iraqi troops and thereby to exert greater control over the terrorists
                            who have been the primary cause of the recent incidents in the Valley.
                            It would also improve the general psychological atmosphere necessary for
                            him to proceed towards a Middle Eastern settlement.</item>

                            <persName>Hussein</persName> interrupted to say that unfortunately the
                            quantities and the delivery dates in the package would not be sufficient
                            to enable him to hold up his head with the officers of his own army. He
                            therefore needed to know as soon as possible whether we would meet his
                            requirements as he had outlined them. When he had our final answer, he
                            intended to send General <persName corresp="#p_KGA1">Khammash</persName>
                            to King <persName corresp="#p_FAAAS1">Faisal</persName> to see what, if
                            anything, <persName corresp="#p_FAAAS1">Faisal</persName> is prepared to
                            do in terms of further financial assistance before he considers other
                            sources.</item>
                        <label>10.</label>
                        <item>I told the King I believed that in constituting our package we had
                            tried to go as far as possible to meet all of his requirements. I was
                            not yet informed, of course, on details of Washington's views on various
                            elements of the package, particularly with regard to detailed provisions
                            of the memo of understanding. I said I would surmise that quantities
                            therein represented the best mix possible, given presumed availability
                            of the items involved and the funds that Jordan had available. I
                            stressed that our capability to extend credit had been drastically
                            modified by Congress. I noted also that we have always tried to exercise
                            restraint with regard to arms deliveries to all states in the area and
                            that no states had obtained everything they wanted when they had come to
                            us for arms. <persName corresp="#p_KGA1">Khammash</persName> had said
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> told him he
                            would take another look at helping Jordan to find some 155mm guns. With
                            regard to delivery dates, I pointed out that the memo of <pb n="171"
                                xml:id="pg_171" facs="0199"/>understanding in para IV-C referred to
                            US fiscal years and not calendar years, which would take six months off
                            the 1970 date. On the other hand, I thought that it would be unrealistic
                            to expect everything to be delivered in calendar year 1968 in view of
                            funds available to Jordan, our own credit limitations, as well as
                            perhaps the limited availability of some of the equipment. I referred to
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s mentioning
                            to <persName corresp="#p_KGA1">Khammash</persName> that he would look
                            again at the possibility of shipping some items out by air. The
                            important thing was that Jordan had a quite substantial military
                            package. I would have hoped this in itself would be enough to take care
                            of morale in his army and public opinion in Jordan and elsewhere,
                            particularly once it became known publicly that items were coming in and
                            that Jordan's “legitimate requirements” were being met by the US.</item>
                        <label>11.</label>
                        <item>Specifically on tanks, I mentioned our understanding British might
                            have up to 200 Centurions available which could easily be upgunned in
                            Jordan with spares available well into 1970. Both King and <persName
                                corresp="#p_KGA1">Khammash</persName> said most emphatically they do
                            not want any more Centurions. <persName corresp="#p_KGA1"
                                >Khammash</persName> added that if he could get additional M48s they
                            need to make up their US tank losses he would happily dump existing
                            Centurions in Gulf of Aqaba—if that were a US condition. Principal
                            argument against Centurions, he said, is Jordan's need to standardize.
                            Now it had very complicated supply and maintenance as well a training
                            problems. Given obsolescence of Centurions and Britain's position today,
                            he thought it would be folly to standardize on British tanks and mixing
                            simply is not feasible.</item>
                        <label>12.</label>
                        <item>As I responded the King kept returning to his original statements with
                            regard to the acceptability of the quantities and delivery dates of the
                            package and his need to know as soon as possible what we are prepared to
                            do to make up for the deficiencies that he sees in it. He wants to send
                                <persName corresp="#p_KGA1">Khammash</persName> to see <persName
                                corresp="#p_FAAAS1">Faisal</persName> as soon as possible.</item>
                        <label>13.</label>
                        <item>With regard to credit and funds, I asked the King if he thought King
                                <persName corresp="#p_FAAAS1">Faisal</persName> would be willing to
                            advance Jordan additional funds if necessary to speed up deliveries or,
                            assuming the additional items might be available, to obtain our
                            agreement to increase some quantities in the package. The King turned to
                                <persName corresp="#p_KGA1">Khammash</persName>, who said <persName
                                corresp="#p_FAAAS1">Faisal</persName> had told them to come back
                            before they went to any other source and they had no clear idea of what
                            he was prepared to do for them. <persName corresp="#p_KGA1"
                                >Khammash</persName> said he would hope that at the very least,
                            however, there might be some way to arrange for Saudi Arabia to put up
                            an acceptable loan to Jordan or loan guarantee to us that would then
                            enable the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> to provide financing or
                            credit arrangements that would take care of the delivery and quantity
                            problems they had just discussed with me.</item>

                            <persName>Hussein</persName> was more relaxed and friendly today than he
                            has ever been with me. It was clear he had been cheered up by our <pb
                                n="172" xml:id="pg_172" facs="0200"/>willingness to go as far as we
                            had. He saw this as a real political plus, but there was no lack of
                            determination in his statements with regard to the present deficiencies
                            he sees in our package and his intention to go elsewhere if necessary.
                            At this stage I feel unable to say whether he will be willing to
                            compromise on less than his total asking price. My present estimate is
                            that there must be some sweetening of the package to gain his
                            acceptance. I believe that the critical sweetener would be some more
                            tanks. Anti-aircraft is also a major concern. Beyond that I think we
                            need to develop a set of options on the other items that he can present
                            to his army as a global indication of what we are prepared to do-subject
                            actually, of course, to his finding additional funds or credit either
                            from us or from the Saudis. We will present our detailed ideas in a

                                the U.S. offer. <persName>Hussein</persName>'s reaction grew out of
                                a concern over losing influence with and control over the army.

                        agreement with Jordan. There are three main parts to the package: (1) about
                        $10 million worth of equipment we had agreed to send <pb n="173"
                            xml:id="pg_173" facs="0201"/>to Jordan before the war broke out last
                        June; (2) about $38 million in new ground equipment including 88 Patton
                        tanks; and (3) 18 F-104 jet fighters ($33 million). Just in case you want
                        more details, I've attached a more complete list.<note n="2" xml:id="d83fn2"

                        the package and the draft memo of understanding we proposed. Our first
                        response will be to help out with his problems in the wording of the memo
                        and to urge him to accept the package as is and get on with delivery.
                        However, we may have a little more bargaining to do yet. He is obviously
                        relieved that we have come this far, and we should be able to bring him
                        around.</p>

                            be available or that it may be too technical to lend itself to
                            expeditious installation in the Jordan Valley terrain. If we have no
                            suitable equipment available, or if for some reason we do not wish to
                            make it available, I would like to be informed expeditiously. It is time
                            we responded in some way to the Jordanians on this matter. Our
                            continuing silence may be interpreted as indifference to Jordanian
                            request or even an unwillingness to help. I am sure that Washington is
                            well aware of nature of terrain we are talking about. It might be well
                            to keep in mind, however, that we are talking about a limited number of
                            fords across river and transit areas in Jordan. We would hope we could
                            find some kind of equipment to monitor these major transit areas even
                            though we could not expect completely to curtail terrorist

                                have to depend on more specific information concerning the type of

                                and he planned to discuss the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>

                                >USG</gloss> had two questions to put to <gloss target="#t_GUAR1"

                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>As to first question, I pointed out to <persName corresp="#p_RM2"
                                >Mohamed</persName> that resolution must be taken as a whole. He was
                            more aware than was I of discussion and travail which had gone into
                            drafting of resolution and its ultimate unanimous adoption by <gloss
                                target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>. Third para of resolution had two very

                        <item>It followed there was direct and unbreakable link between two
                            questions I had put to him. If <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> in
                            fact accepted resolution, it should also be prepared to take practical
                            steps required to reach agreement and an accepted solution.</item>

                        <item>In all frankness, nothing which had so far appeared in <gloss

                                >FonMin</gloss> had not been explicit as to next steps. Moreover,

                            today (Feb 19) receive answers to questions I had posed Feb 17. Riad
                            opened conversation by repeating two questions I had put, viz.: (A) Did
                                <gloss target="#t_GUAR1">GUAR</gloss> accept Nov 22 resolution and
                            (B) assuming that both <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and Israel
                            accepted resolution, how did <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                            envisage next steps? Riad then proceeded to read verbatim from lengthy
                            statement which he had drafted and which he said he had that morning
                            read to his <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> who had approved

                        <item>In response to my first question, <persName corresp="#p_RM2"
                                >Mohamed</persName> gave lengthy historical excursus beginning from
                            fact that since my return to Egypt <gloss target="#t_GUAR1">GUAR</gloss>
                            had made it a point keep me fully informed of all its activities re
                            Middle East crisis and to indicate that it was seeking peaceful
                            solution. <persName corresp="#p_RM2">Mohamed</persName> then quoted
                            excerpts from various conversations with <persName corresp="#p_JG1"

                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>Riad then specifically referred to third para of <gloss
                                target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> resolution and said <gloss
                                target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> should have no doubt as to <gloss
                                target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> position. When <gloss target="#t_GUAR1"
                                >GUAR</gloss> said it accepted resolution as a whole and that it
                            should be treated as an entity, <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> has
                            made its position very clear. Riad cited US-<gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                                >UAR</gloss> discussions in New York prior to passage resolution
                            where <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> accepted concept of treating
                            resolution as a whole. He said in light of all this Egyptians asked
                            themselves why there was any doubt in mind <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                >USG</gloss> re <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> position.</item>

                            step in case Israel accepts <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>
                            resolution. <persName corresp="#p_RM2">Mohamed</persName> said <gloss
                                target="#t_GUAR1">GUAR</gloss> believed this was hypothetical
                            question. He said <gloss target="#t_GUAR1">GUAR</gloss> believed it
                            within its right to know what was Israel's position vis-a-vis <pb

                            implementing resolution, this was something <gloss target="#t_GUAR1"
                                >GUAR</gloss> would state after it knew Israel's reply.</item>

                                >Mohamed</persName>, Egyptians had told <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                                >Jarring</persName> several times and specifically in their last
                            meeting that re method of implementing resolution, <gloss

                                corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>. Egyptians assumed Israel would

                            <persName corresp="#p_RM2">Mohamed</persName> then said “Now we ask you,
                            what do you want? We still remember that on the record you made a
                            statement in <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> in which Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> declared that US
                            would put all its weight behind resolution and that it would in due
                            course request parties to implement it. When I speak about the
                            resolution we mean the resolution as adopted by the Council taking into
                            consideration all consultations that took place prior to the adoption.
                            We also take into consideration that US accepted from the beginning that
                            there would be no negotiations and no peace treaty. The question is what
                            your position will be if Israel continues in its present position of
                            refusing to accept the resolution. This will mean the stringing out of
                                <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>'s mission. We believe
                            that the big powers should, at some moment if Israel persists, convene

                            “direct negotiations,” seemed equally valid that resolution envisaged
                            some kind of discussion among parties as only feasible means of

                        purpose of this meeting is to review the situation and to discuss what more
                        we can do to reverse the trend.</p>
                    <p>We can take some steps like sending arms to Jordan or renewing relations with
                        Cairo. But the Arabs will mainly measure us by our success in promoting an
                        Arab-Israeli arrangement which would lead to Israeli withdrawal. In this

                                Israelis are evasive because they fear Cairo will interpret their

                                like permanent boundaries. Israel wants to be sure talks will follow
                                their acceptance. The Egyptians say they “accept” the whole
                                resolution but won't commit themselves to talks until Israel
                                “accepts” the resolution. Ambassadors <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1"

                                the question is how much harder we press Israel to break this

                            of some of the tanks (and 155 mm guns which may not be available) we are
                            offering to make up his June losses. The Russians have done no more for

                            and <persName corresp="#p_KGA1">Khammash</persName> should be fully
                            conversant. Our offer should be viewed in this context.</item>

                        <item>As <persName corresp="#p_KGA1">Khammash</persName> left Washington
                            before we had a chance to explain our package, we believe the Jordanians
                            perhaps do not fully appreciate all of the considerations which went
                            into the determination of the size of the package. The arms offered to
                            Jordan include almost every item in the spectrum of military hardware
                            used by the Jordan Arab Army. Such a sweeping offer should be very
                            useful to the King in explaining his policy to the army officers. It
                            should also be noted that the <pb n="182" xml:id="pg_182" facs="0210"

                                >Khammash</persName> should be familiar, it would be difficult for
                            us to enlarge our arms package at this time. There are very real
                            restraints in terms of quantities on what we can offer at any one time.
                            We cannot ignore strong congressional and public feeling against (a) the
                            supply of arms to countries where economic resources are so limited and
                            (b) where we appear to be arming both sides of a conflict. These same
                            restraints have influenced our response to Israeli requests as well.
                            There is also genuine concern within the <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                >USG</gloss> that Jordan's military establishment not be drastically
                            disproportionate to its economic capacity to finance such an
                            establishment. However irrelevant such considerations may seem to be to
                            the King's immediate problem, these are facts of life with which we have
                            to deal. Notwithstanding, we have offered him as an earnest of our
                            support such politically sensitive items as tanks, planes, artillery and

                            items as tanks or artillery they do contain important communications
                            equipment, some vehicles, ammunition and vitally needed spares for
                            tanks, vehicles and weapons. The memorandum of understanding listed only

                        <item>You may also wish to point out that the Jordanians have apparently
                            given no consideration to the rate at which the equipment requested by
                                <persName corresp="#p_KGA1">Khammash</persName> can be effectively

                        <item>On the subject of aircraft, we find the Jordanian reaction difficult
                            to understand. General <persName corresp="#p_KGA1">Khammash</persName>
                            told the negotiating team that he wanted a supersonic multi-purpose
                            plane but also made clear that <pb n="184" xml:id="pg_184" facs="0212"
                            />he wanted a type which could intercept high level MACH 2 intruders.
                                <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>. He told General <persName
                                corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> he wanted F-104's. End <gloss
                                target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>. With the negotiating teams he refused
                            to specify the American aircraft he had in mind. When pressed he
                            replied, “It is for you to choose which of your aircraft is most
                            suitable for our needs.” The F-104, in addition to being an excellent
                            high level interceptor, can be converted to carry out a tactical ground
                            support mission. Conversion kits to add a bomb carrying capability were
                            included in the original sales contract. The A-4 on the other hand has
                            practically no air defense capability. It is a subsonic attack bomber.
                            The F-5 is a possible substitute but Jordan would then lose a
                            substantial part of the $10 million they have already paid on the
                            F-104's. In addition, the delivery time would be much longer, perhaps 18
                            to 24 months. We were given clearly to understand by General <persName
                                corresp="#p_KGA1">Khammash</persName> that delivery time on aircraft
                            was extremely important to him. We therefore designed a package that
                            together with the 18 Hawker Hunters he anticipates receiving from the
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, would give him 36 good planes to
                            fly, off Jordan's own airfields, before the end of this calendar year.
                            If some other Arab state, such as Saudi Arabia, were willing to foot the
                            bill, we would have no objection to Jordan purchasing Lightnings or
                            Mirages, but they would cost two or three times as much as the F-104's
                            with uncertain delivery times.</item>
                        <label>11.</label>
                        <item>Given Jordan's present comfortable reserve position and relatively
                            large balances of unused donations we do not believe that any credit
                            should now be offered for arms purchases. We understand that Jordan's
                            longer range economic future is a matter of concern to the <gloss

                            peace in the area, and indicated that Israel was willing to have such

                        chairmanship of the Vice President. Then word came that the President would
                        soon be available, and the Council adjourned to the Cabinet Room where
                        further informal discussion took place before the President's arrival. Then
                        the President came in and the discussion continued in a more formal way.</p>

                            <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> summarized the
                                US position in the Middle East by saying that there is no blinking
                                the fact that US influence in the area has been deteriorating.
                                Conversely, Soviet influence has been increasing. He suggested
                                discussing this problem under two headings-our relations with the
                                countries of the Near East and Soviet intentions toward the
                                area.</p>
                            <p>Speaking of our relations with the Arab world, he noted that we would
                                have suffered some loss of influence had there been no Arab-Israeli
                                war. He cited as the reason for this the natural growth of Arab <pb
                                    n="188" xml:id="pg_188" facs="0216"/>nationalism and “the
                                general changing face of the world.” This was complicated by the
                                US-Israeli relationship and by the extent to which Congress had
                                restricted the resources available for use in the area. In the face
                                of these restrictions, we have “very little elbow room.”</p>
                            <p>Turning to Soviet intentions, he noted that there is not total
                                agreement on just what Moscow is up to. The Russians themselves may
                                not have a clear picture of their strategy. Obviously, they want to
                                see the US position deteriorate and theirs improve, yet without a
                                    US-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> confrontation. Over the
                                past year, they have played their hand in the Middle East in a more
                                traditional diplomatic way. They have done certain things to
                                capitalize on the upheaval last June, but they have also shown some
                                hesitancy in involving themselves in inter-Arab quarrels. They have
                                also sought to improve the military facilities available to them in
                                the area. In short, they are not taking any losses, but they are not
                                jumping in with both feet either.</p>
                            <p>What can we do? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>
                                felt there would not be a great problem if the <persName
                                    corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> mission succeeds. If that
                                happened, some of the Congressional restraints would be relaxed, and
                                we would be able to keep some influence in the Arab world. He would
                                not put chances of <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>'s
                                success particularly high, but because of the serious consequences
                                for us if <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> fails, we
                                should put everything we have into making it succeed. He recognized
                                the risk of backing a failing effort but he felt that if <persName
                                    corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> fails we will be left with a
                                situation that is “absolutely intolerable.” He pointed out that this
                                raises serious questions about what we should do if <persName
                                    corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> fails. These are not
                                questions that need to be settled now, but they are serious.</p>
                            <p>He concluded by pointing out that there are natural limitations on
                                Soviet ability to increase influence in the area. He felt the normal
                                situation in the Middle East would be for us both to be operating
                                there.</p>
                            <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BLD1">Battle</persName> added that we are,
                                in addition to these problems, also faced with the British
                                withdrawal from the area and the consequent decline of general
                                Western influence in the Middle East.</p>
                            <p>Mr. <persName>Rostow</persName> reported that he had just had a talk
                                with Ralph Bunche. Bunche, as a veteran of Rhodes, thinks that
                                    <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> is now in a
                                position to declare that all parties accept the <gloss
                                    target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolution and to invite them to a
                                meeting on Cyprus. Bunche recognized from his own experience that
                                tactically and in substance Jerusalem is the most explosive issue.
                                If it came to the Security Council now, it could destroy <persName
                                    corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>'s effort. Operationally,
                                aside from nudging the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and
                                Israel toward talks, the big question for us is when and at what
                                level we lean on Israel on Jerusalem.</p>
                            <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> opined that
                                Jerusalem in the Security Council would be less likely to sabotage
                                the <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> mission if
                                    <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> is conducting <pb
                                    n="189" xml:id="pg_189" facs="0217"/>talks. Mr. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_BLD1">Battle</persName> pointed out that the danger
                                is that Jerusalem will come to the Security Council just at a point
                                when the <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> mission
                                appears to be near a breakdown. He would like to see Israel stop all
                                activities in Jerusalem which make it appear that Israel is steadily
                                incorporating former Jordanian Jerusalem into the Israeli sector.
                                Mr. <persName>Marks</persName> asked how hard we had leaned on
                                Israel. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BLD1">Battle</persName> indicated
                                that we had leaned quite hard for accepting the <gloss
                                    target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolution. At that point word came
                                that the group should move to the Cabinet Room, and Mr. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_BLD1">Battle</persName> did not have a chance to
                                answer the question as it related to Jerusalem.</p>

                            <p>In the informal discussion which continued around the Cabinet table
                                while the Council waited for the President, Mr. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_BLD1">Battle</persName> and the Vice President
                                discussed our relations with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                                    >Nasser</persName>. The Vice President said that we had tried to
                                get along with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> but he
                                had finally concluded that “<persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                                    >Nasser</persName> just did not like us.” Mr. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_BLD1">Battle</persName> felt that the reason for the
                                failure of our policy 1962-1965 was that we had mounted a policy
                                that we could not sustain without <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                                    >Nasser</persName>'s cooperation. As long as <persName
                                    corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> made speeches lambasting the
                                US, we could not hope to win Congressional support for a policy of
                                supporting him. The Vice President questioned whether we should
                                resume relations and thereby tend to support <persName
                                    corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s continuation in office. He
                                felt there were people in the area who would know how to “bring
                                    <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> down.” Mr.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_BLD1">Battle</persName> suggested that we
                                were not sure that leaders who followed would not be worse, although
                                there were still pro-Western people around <persName
                                    corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> to whom we would still like
                                to hold out a hand.</p>
                            <p>The Vice President then noted the difficulty of explaining to the
                                American Jewish community how much we had done over the past year in
                                support of Israel. He felt that stories of our plane sales had not
                                reached the average member of the Jewish community and that many
                                members felt that we were pursuing a half-hearted policy toward
                                Israel.</p>

                            <p>At this point the President entered and Mr.
                                    <persName>Rostow</persName> summarized the discussion to this
                                point.</p>
                            <p>The President noted that <persName corresp="#p_BER1">Eugene
                                    Black</persName> had reported to him that our position in the
                                Near East was deteriorating. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BER1"
                                    >Black</persName> had recommended more contact with <persName
                                    corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>. He had recommended, in
                                reference to the false charges levied against us last June, that we
                                accept the idea that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
                                had been misinformed. Unless we do, resumption of relations is
                                hopeless.</p>
                        </item>
                    </list>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> said that we were
                        prepared to resume relations if we had an opportunity. We did not expect too
                        much to follow from resumption of relations. He felt that perhaps the
                        problem of the “big lie” would be taken care of by Mr.
                            <persName>Attwood</persName>'s interview with <persName

                            xml:id="d91fn2">On March 19 <hi rend="italic">Look</hi> published the
                            text of an interview with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
                            in which William Attwood posed a question concerning the <gloss
                                target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> accusation that U.S. planes had
                            participated in the Israeli attack on the <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                                >UAR</gloss> during the June war. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                                >Nasser</persName> said that the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                            had merely repeated information he had received in a telephone call from
                            King <persName>Hussein</persName>. In response to another question,
                                <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> agreed that the
                            accusation resulted from suspicion and faulty information.</note> Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BLD1">Battle</persName> pointed out that we still
                        want <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> to take the initiative in
                        resuming relations, and the President did not disagree.</p>
                    <p>The President asked whether we were any nearer to working out some
                        arrangements with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> on arms
                        limitation, or is that in limbo?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> said it was pretty much
                        in limbo. Ambassador Thompson had talked with Kosygin, and Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> had raised the matter with
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> the previous
                        Thursday.</p>
                    <p>The President said that he had “played for time” with the Israelis. He had
                        hoped before Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> left
                        to have discussions on the ABM with the Soviet Union. He felt that Kosygin
                        had agreed at Glassboro to have such discussions.</p>
                    <p>A brief exchange followed on exactly what Kosygin had agreed to at Glassboro.
                        The President felt that he had pressed over and over for a date to begin
                        these discussions. He said that he had just talked to U Thant about
                        achieving some sort of arms limitation and about registering with the <gloss
                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> arms shipments to the Middle East. He said
                        all he had done at the Ranch with Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_EL1"
                            >Eshkol</persName> was to postpone our decision in hopes that some of
                        this could take place. Did anybody have any suggestions?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> felt that a good deal
                        depends on Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>. If he
                        succeeds, then arms limitation can be discussed.</p>
                    <p>The President asked whether there was any chance that <persName
                            corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> would succeed. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> felt that the chances were “less
                        than even.” Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said
                        he was “very pessimistic” and rated chances for his success as perhaps “one
                        in four.”</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> further noted the
                        shortage of US resources for this area. He felt that the Middle East should
                        be given very high priority for our resources. When the President asked
                        whether this would be from existing funds or from a supplemental
                        appropriation, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said
                        both, but felt that, as far as Defense was concerned, needs could be met
                        largely from existing appropriations.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and Mr.

                                blackmail. Their tactic was to separate elements of Security Council
                                resolution and deal with it in phases. Israel believed, however,
                                that if it withdrew without settlement nothing would be

                                    <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> mission. Israel
                                continued to hope that view would be accepted that all elements of

                    <p>2. <persName>Rostow</persName> commented that <gloss target="#t_GOI1"
                            >GOI</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> remained united on
                        fundamental question of peace. Issues on which we had problems would come up
                        and have to be dealt with in negotiations. <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                            >UAR</gloss> had torpedoed possibility of phased solution by linking
                        Canal passage with refugee problem. <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                            >Jarring</persName> mission had been delayed by unnecessary
                        preoccupation with question of “acceptance” of resolution. We had thought a
                        simple formula could be found which could protect Israeli position. This
                        problem may now in any case have been overcome since according our latest
                        information from Cairo, <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> seemed to be
                        accepting idea of talks on Cyprus. If this true, <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                            >Jarring</persName> would be reporting it to <gloss target="#t_GOI1"
                            >GOI</gloss> and we did not want to get in middle.</p>
                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> asked whether this meant
                        “direct negotiations.” <persName>Rostow</persName> said it did not mean
                        meeting in the same room but thought that would come in time. What <persName
                            corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> wanted now was to get parties to
                        Cyprus. To Rostow's comment that we had done our best to make clear the
                        importance of “accepting” resolution, <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1"
                            >Rabin</persName> replied that this problem now solved.
                            <persName>Rostow</persName> said it was our understanding that <persName
                            corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> would now try to produce piece of
                        paper himself for parties to accept.</p>
                    <p>4. <persName>Rostow</persName> noted question had arisen whether Russians
                        controlled situation in <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. <persName
                            corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> said he did not think so; <persName
                            corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> had freedom of action to decide if
                        he had will to do so.</p>
                    <p>5. <persName>Rostow</persName> noted we were concerned about situation in
                        Jordan. <persName>Hussein</persName> was in trouble because of his statement
                        on terrorism and, while he wanted to move toward settlement, did not dare do
                        so alone. <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> replied that
                        hopefully <persName>Hussein</persName> had learned at last that, if he
                        wanted to survive, he must control terrorism. Admitting that
                            <persName>Hussein</persName> faced risk either way, <persName
                            corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> thought on balance control of
                        terrorism would increase <persName>Hussein</persName> chances of surviving
                        since, if terrorists got upper hand, <persName>Hussein</persName> would
                        eventually lose control of country. <persName>Hussein</persName> must make
                        clear to Jordanian people that in the end they are the victims of terrorism.
                        If <persName>Hussein</persName> exerted sufficient force, he could
                        survive.</p>
                    <p>6. On Syria, <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> said no one could
                        be sure what was happening there. He speculated, however, that removal of

                    <p>In the oral message, conveyed through Ambassador Thompson on January 22, you
                        touched upon the question, which has been already within our sight and on
                        which the position of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> was laid
                        down in the Soviet draft resolution of the Security Council of November 20,
                        1967, concerning the questions of political settlement in the Middle East.
                        Had the Government of the United States wished to put the discussion of this
                        matter on the practical plane then a proper opportunity would have been
                        presented by the provisions of the Soviet draft, which stated, in
                        particular, about taking measures for limitation of useless and wasteful
                        arms race on the condition of withdrawal of the Israeli troops from all
                        occupied Arab territories.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Government, as before, agrees under certain conditions to an
                        exchange of views on the question of limiting the delivery of arms to the
                        Middle East and would be ready to discuss this matter with the leaders of
                        the friendly Arab states. However, we are deeply convinced that the main
                        link of the whole complicated knot of the Middle East problems does not lie
                        now in this. The clue to a settlement of the present crisis in the Middle
                        East is in the speediest withdrawal of Israeli forces from the occupied Arab
                        territories, in the elimination of the consequences of the Israeli
                        aggression. You will agree, Mr. President, that it would be pointless to
                        speak of ending arms race in the Middle East while Israel, using armed
                        force, is retaining and even trying to secure the occupation of Arab
                        territories seized by her.</p>

                    <p>Certainly, if the United States also adopted the position answering the
                        interests of peace in the Middle East and supported the legitimate demands
                        for the withdrawal of the Israeli troops to the lines existed before June 5,
                        1967, Israel would—and there is no doubt about it—release the seized
                        territories, the Suez canal would be opened and the unsolved problems would
                        be settled. There can be neither peace nor political settlement in the
                        Middle East without the withdrawal of the Israeli troops from the occupied
                        Arab territories. This is the first and basic point regarding which there
                        must be full clarity. Without it the wishes for the limitation of arms race
                        in the Middle East have no real ground. So long as the Israeli leaders,
                        enjoying the support from the outside, adhere to the position of annexation
                        of the Arab territories the friends of the Arab countries and the partisans
                        of lasting peace in the Middle East will help the victims of aggression,
                        since in doing so they are fulfilling their duty in accordance with the U.N.
                        Charter and the interests of maintaining peace.</p>
                    <p>At the same time we would like to stress at this instance again that, as
                        before, we are firmly standing for lessening tension in the Middle East, for
                        turning this area into a zone of lasting peace, and no one should have any
                        doubts about that.</p>

                    <p>You should know that the Israelis are claiming that a major change is taking
                        place in Soviet-Egyptian military relations. They believe that 50 or more
                        Soviet pilots are now flying with the Egyptians, that the Russians are in
                        the process of taking over the air defense system, and that arrangements
                        have been made for sending five more squadrons of <gloss target="#t_MIG1"
                            >MIG</gloss>-21's to Egypt. From this information they conclude that
                        Israel is losing its air superiority, and the Air Force commander is talking
                        in <pb n="195" xml:id="pg_195" facs="0223"/>terms of needing a hundred more
                        planes. So far, they haven't made any formal request.</p>
                    <p>The Israelis are making the strongest possible case out of the information,
                        but if their facts are right, it isn't a bad case. Our intelligence people
                        are unable to confirm what the Israelis are telling us, but they admit that
                        Israeli sources could be better than ours. They are trying to get a clearer
                        picture, but at this point they just don't know whether the Israelis are
                        telling the truth.<note n="2" xml:id="d94fn2">A handwritten note by
                                <persName>Rostow</persName> reads: “Tell Israel they better work out
                            peace plan.” This comment apparently was the President's response to
                            this memorandum.</note>

                            felt it would also be necessary to help Jordan get additional financial

                            the ground package will be granted. It appears that the arguments
                            supplied by the Department and which we have been using in favor of
                            F-104s have borne fruit. These have been reinforced by the apparent
                            unwillingness of Faisal to help on aircraft and by favorable reports on
                            the F-104 obtained from the Pakistanis. <persName corresp="#p_KGA1"

                                >Khammash</persName> explained that basic problem of Jordan's
                            acceptance of F-104 aircraft has been negative feeling among Jordanian
                            pilots towards this model. Crash of two 104s during College Run project
                            last year, against background of German air force losses, confirmed
                            their suspicions F-104 was unsafe aircraft.</item>

                            <persName corresp="#p_KGA1">Khammash</persName> said he had been doing
                            some quiet propaganda on his own in favor of F-104 over past several
                            weeks. He sent Jordanian Air Force Chief Colonel Kurdi to Pakistan last
                            weekend to discuss F-104s with Paks. Kurdi, who had been dubious both
                            about safety of this plane and whether it would serve Jordanian
                            purposes, returned with considerably less negative outlook. He also
                            brought news that Paks had said they would try to be helpful should
                            Jordanians need any extra indoctrination and on the job training or
                            maintenance.</item>

                            <persName corresp="#p_KGA1">Khammash</persName> said his trip earlier
                            this week to Saudi Arabia (Amman 3570) had made him very dubious that
                                <persName corresp="#p_FAAAS1">Faisal</persName> would be willing to
                            underwrite purchases of Mirage aircraft or turn Saudi Lightnings over to
                            Jordan. Further argument <persName corresp="#p_KGA1">Khammash</persName>
                            had adduced for the F-104s, therefore, in session Feb 29 with King and
                            Kurdi was economy. Lacking assurance from <persName corresp="#p_FAAAS1"
                                >Faisal</persName> that Saudi Arabia would assist and in view
                            probability Jordan stood to lose several million dollars already paid
                            down on F-104 training and rehabilitation, he argued Kingdom could not
                            afford to choose any other model.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>In course of several hours meeting Feb 29 with King and Kurdi,
                            foregoing points had been discussed as well as aircraft availabilities
                            and costs. It was decided that it was essential Jordan should be able to
                            state it was getting aircraft in relatively near future. Fact that
                            delivery time for Mirages and Lightnings could be as much as three years
                            away would seriously diminish credibility of King's posture that he
                            doing utmost to re-equip Jordanian armed forces. (<persName
                                corresp="#p_KGA1">Khammash</persName>, however, made clear to Emboff
                            that he continued to have some doubts as to advisability having F-104s
                            stationed in Jordan as early as this summer both because he might be
                            expected to use them and because the airfields and ground control
                            equipment would not be ready and personnel fully qualified.)</item>
                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>Kurdi conceded that given all these arguments and his trip to Pakistan
                            he felt with careful indoctrination of Jordanian pilots, which should
                            include orientation visits to USA and Pakistan, the pilots could be
                            brought around to accept this aircraft. He therefore would withdraw his
                            objection to acquisition of F-104s. King said that this change in
                            Kurdi's position removed his, <persName>Hussein</persName>'s, only
                            serious objection to the F-104. <persName>Hussein</persName> said he
                            would not have forced an unacceptable aircraft on Jordan's air force: to
                            do so would only create further problems. <persName corresp="#p_KGA1"

                            thereupon agreed to accept F-104s and carry out further pilot
                            indoctrination to increase the pilots' confidence <pb n="197"

                            out in this indoctrination because there could be a lingering problem if
                            not resolved.</item>

                            outstanding question in connection with aircraft sale. In regard to $2.8
                            million ground control radar system for F-104 and Hawker Hunter aircraft
                            which we had undertaken to supply, he said he would like insurance that
                            this system would be adequate to do the job and not just a shoestring
                            operation tailored to fit Jordan's budget. He said it was in neither
                            Jordan's nor US interest to attempt to operate F-104s with deficient
                            ground control system.</item>

                            conviction I expressed in my recent letter (State reftel) that great
                            restraint is required in Israel's policies respecting Jerusalem. This
                            conviction has been reinforced both by the somewhat improved prospects
                            for meaningful negotiations under <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                                >Jarring</persName>'s aegis and by the increasing sense of
                            frustration over Jerusalem on the part of the Arabs which continues to
                            jeopardize this hopeful trend. According to our information, Israel has
                            continued with expropriations of land and with the related new
                            construction projects in the eastern part of Jerusalem. It is precisely
                            these activities, however, which understandingly give rise to concerns
                            that the character of this part of Jerusalem is being irrevocably
                            changed and that the possibilities of negotiating about its future are
                            being foreclosed. I believe, therefore, that a suspension of the
                            expropriation proceedings and of the related construction is essential
                            to preserve a situation in which negotiation about the Middle East
                            problem as a whole can take place. I strongly urge that the Government
                            of Israel take this important step, in addition to refraining from any
                            new measures which prejudice the future of Jerusalem.</item>

                            negotiations on Nicosia. While they did not quite exclude possibility,
                            they would not answer question in absence of Israeli acceptance of

                            assurance Soviet Union did not want matter returned to Security Council
                            and General Assembly, but wanted to work with us and parties to
                            facilitate <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>'s effort. He
                            agreed frank discussions between us on these subjects could clear away
                            suspicions and misunderstandings, and therefore be helpful. Answering
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>'s question,
                                <persName>Rostow</persName> said in our view whole exercise about
                            “accepting” the resolution was metaphysical irrelevance, which had
                            delayed process of peace dangerously. We assumed all parties had
                            “accepted” resolution when it was passed, in sense of agreeing to work
                            under it. But Arab insistence on words “respect and implement” had given
                            rise to suspicions they were seeking settlement like that of 1957,
                            without negotiations among parties and without engagement. After what
                            had happened in 1967, this procedure was out of question. Resolution in
                            our view was not self-implementing. It required agreement on part of
                            parties—as to frontiers, security arrangements, and other matters. We
                            did not see how it could be implemented unless there were
                            negotiations-or, if that word was cabalistic to Arabs, discussions among
                            parties looking to agreements called for by resolution. From our talks
                            in Cairo, we had impression Egyptians have been stressing word
                            “implement” rather than “accept” precisely in order to avoid
                            negotiations. We did not insist on direct negotiations. We had relied on
                                <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s public statement he
                            would engage in negotiations like those in Rhodes, i.e., discussions
                            with Israelis in presence of <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                                >Jarring</persName>. <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> Ambassadors
                            had made same point to us and to British. On basis of those statements,
                            we had urged Israelis to agree to procedure, and they had done so,
                            publicly and to <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>. We and
                            British thought some such <pb n="202" xml:id="pg_202" facs="0230"
                            />procedure was indispensable. Present confusion illustrated its value.
                            We were working in dark, on basis of ex parte reports of talks with
                                <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>, which might or might
                            not be accurate. We all had great stake in <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                                >Jarring</persName>'s success. We were evidently agreed that nothing
                            but trouble could come from return to Security Council. Why should we
                            allow others to drag us into troubles we did not want? It was our
                            appraisal of the situation that if it were clear <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                                >UAR</gloss> would engage in substantive negotiations, in Rhodes
                            pattern, on real problems under resolution-borders, security
                            arrangements, refugees-semantic difficulties about words used in
                            “accepting” resolution could be overcome.</item>

                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he didn't see why
                            so much stress was put on meetings in Nicosia, and he couldn't
                            understand why Israelis, who were such clever people, made so much
                            difficulty about accepting resolution. Egyptians had assured Soviets
                            they would deal with every issue mentioned in resolution. That should be
                            sufficient assurance to Israelis and to us that all issues would be
                            taken up. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> clearly was
                            not fighting hard on the Nicosia issue, but he did not undertake to
                            press Egyptians on it, either. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> then asked for our views on how resolution
                            could be implemented, as a practical matter. Could it be done in stages?
                            For example, would we favor an Israeli withdrawal from “territories
                            occupied in recent conflict,” as called for under Article I of
                            resolution, accompanied by recognition on part of Arabs of Israel's
                            right to live, to be followed by negotiations on use of waterways,
                            refugees, security arrangements.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>Rostow said he could not speak for Israel, but we had favored any
                            approach on which parties could agree for moving towards peace, and
                            certainly would not exclude implementing agreement in stages. But he did
                            not think scenario <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> laid
                            out was feasible, or complied with resolution as whole. We had favored
                            approach which would have linked withdrawals to end of belligerency, but
                                <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> had said it would not open canal
                            to Israeli shipping until refugee problem was solved. We were willing to
                            go along with that approach, which was that of Security Council
                            Resolution. If <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> preferred package
                            deal, we had no objections. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> said the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                            did prefer package deal, but maybe practicable way could be found to get
                            some change in situation soon. <persName>Rostow</persName> said we would
                            favor progressive steps towards peace. But resolution required agreement
                            on “secure and recognized” boundaries, which, as practical matter, and
                            as matter of interpreting resolution, had to precede withdrawals. Two
                            principles were basic to Article I of resolution. Paragraph from which
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> quoted was linked to
                            others, and he did not see how anyone could seriously argue, in light of
                            history of resolution in Security Council, withdrawal to borders of June
                            4th was contemplated. These words had been pressed on Council by Indians

                            said we thought it should not be too difficult, in context of peace. As
                            he knew, Secretary thought refugees ought to be given some real choices,

                                >Jarring</persName> to reach a just and durable settlement in the
                            Middle East, I can assure you, Mr. President, that we have extremely
                            high hopes that this valuable support may enable Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> to make progress in the pursuit
                            of his mission. However, I regret to inform you, Mr. President, that I
                            have become extremely disheartened by what appears to be lack of genuine
                            interest in a just and durable peace by the Israelis. It is unfortunate
                            that their victory should direct them to follow a very narrow and
                            short-sighted approach. For though the Israelis have won a battle they
                            seem unable to appreciate the fact that they have not won a war. This is
                            manifested in their lack of clarity over the acceptance of the Security
                            Council's resolution under the mandate of which Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> is pursuing his mission; in
                            their arbitrary actions in defiance of a semi-unanimous United Nations
                            resolution on Jerusalem; in their continuing actions aiming at major
                            alterations in the city which, as you well know, Mr. President, does not
                            belong to us alone but to all Arabs and Muslims who have enjoyed the
                            privilege of being the proud custodians of the holy places within it
                            since the time of the Khalifa Omar, over thirteen centuries ago; in
                            compelling thousands upon thousands of people to continue to leave the
                            areas acquired by Israel through aggression and to flee in the face of
                            terror and persecution, thus adding an unimaginable strain to the
                            already heavy burdens which we shoulder; and finally in their most
                            recent decision to alter the status and even the name of the occupied
                            West Bank, thus dealing a severe blow to the <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                                >Jarring</persName> Mission and any chance of its success. Such
                            actions do not create an atmosphere conducive to the laying of
                            foundations for a just and durable peace and are in defiance of the
                            United Nations through which Israel was created, and which has
                            repeatedly called upon Israel to respect the rights of the people she
                            persecuted and to permit them to return to their homes and land.</item>
                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>Furthermore, Israel has persisted in the use of brutal force and has
                            constantly attacked our people on the East Bank of Jordan, inflicting
                            heavy losses of life and property. Her ridiculous and totally
                            incomprehensible excuse for doing all this is that I am not fulfilling
                            my so-called duty of ensuring the safety and security of her forces
                            which occupy a good portion of my country. Israel seems unwilling to
                            understand that so long as she remains in such occupation she will be
                                <pb n="205" xml:id="pg_205" facs="0233"/>met by mounting resistance
                            by the people under occupation and who are victims of her aggression.
                            The sum total of all this is a great tragedy for peace and for those who
                            believe that a just, honourable and durable peace can and must exist in
                            this area, and a growing realisation that the chance of achieving such a
                            peace which, in my opinion, is the first and last such chance, may be
                            lost to all forever.</item>

                        <item>I hope my readings are wrong, although what I live and see makes me
                            tend to believe that I am right. I am confident that you, Mr. President,
                            will spare no effort to ensure that such a chance is not lost.</item>

                    </list>
                    <p>Negotiations on Israel's PL 480 agreement begin Tuesday. The Israelis have
                        made one final low-key pitch for concessions. I report it because it was
                        made on instruction but I would be inclined to stick to our present
                        position, because I think we can do so without creating a problem and
                        because we're already making a major concession in having any PL 480 program
                        at all for Israel.</p>
                    <pb n="206" xml:id="pg_206" facs="0234"/>
                    <p>You will recall that, in approving the $27 million Israeli food sale, you
                        decided that Israel should move this year to 100% dollar sale. The
                        alternative was 75% dollar and 25% local currency. All of your advisers
                        recommended a 100% dollar sale, and I recall your agreeing strongly that
                        Israel “shouldn't be begging.”</p>
                    <p>A less significant element in the normal terms for this kind of agreement is
                        a 5% downpayment (in this case $1.35 million). We do waive this in some
                        cases (India, Pakistan, Indonesia, Congo, Ceylon, Ghana, Guinea) and reduce
                        it in others (Morocco, Tunisia, Sudan). No one sees any economic reason not
                        to require the full 5% from Israel.</p>
                    <p>Saturday, Eppie Evron “on instructions” from his Finance Minister asked us to
                        reconsider reducing the dollar requirements to 75% and waiving the
                        downpayment. He admitted, in making this pitch to Hal Saunders, that they
                        weren't going to make a federal case of this. He acted like someone
                        dutifully carrying out orders, knowing that the decision had been made.</p>
                    <p>The one reason for making any concession would be to give them the sense that
                        we're not being completely uncompromising. Eppie points out that they're
                        already making the $200 million shift in reserves <persName corresp="#p_EL1"
                            >Eshkol</persName> promised and buying $50 million in commodities here
                        for cash.</p>
                    <p>All of your advisers are inclined to resist this final effort. But if you

                    <p>We are well down this track and everybody in-house instinctively feels it's
                        the right one. However, in my talks of the past few days, I have seen the
                        issue it raises posed more sharply than ever, and I'd like to review for a
                        moment the <hi rend="italic">two schools of argument</hi> and give you my
                        thoughts on what this move will and won't net us.</p>
                    <list>
                        <label>1.</label>
                        <item>We are most familiar with the feeling that we ought to <hi
                                rend="italic">restore</hi> relations with Cairo because that's the
                            key to resuming normal relations with the rest of the Arab world. Along
                            with this argument goes the feeling that we're just generally better off
                            present than absent. Part of our concern is the belief that a US
                            presence will give <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> some
                            Westward anchor against mounting Soviet influence. Some followers of
                            this school may even feel that a US presence would give <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> enough added confidence to get
                            on with peace negotiations. Underlying all this is the estimate that
                                <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> has improved his
                            position, and will be around for some time as no replacement is in
                            sight.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>The other school starts with a different estimate—that <hi
                                rend="italic">Nasser's days are clearly numbered</hi>. Some (like
                            Morroe Berger) even go so far as to say that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                                >Nasser</persName> had run out of steam before the war, and the
                            defeat was only the latest in a series of blunders. Adherents of this
                            school feel that the sub-political levels of the <gloss
                                target="#t_GUAR1">GUAR</gloss> want <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                                >Nasser</persName> to fall and would regret any US action which
                            would give him a temporary reprieve. They believe that he's too weak to
                            make peace and that Egypt's economy won't progress any further until he
                            goes. Some (like <persName corresp="#p_EE1">Evron</persName>) believe
                            that <pb n="208" xml:id="pg_208" facs="0236"/>only <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s passing will permit the change
                            of Arab heart that is the prime requisite for a lasting peace. This adds
                            up to belief that <hi rend="italic">we won't gain enough to compensate
                                for putting off the day when <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"

                    </list>
                    <p>I must admit that, personally, I'm torn. I guess my position boils down to

                                    access or our reporting, then it's worth resuming</hi>. I can't
                                get rid of the instinctive feeling that we should at least be
                                present. Then I stop and think that we're already as “present” as
                                we're likely to be. Don Bergus' official contacts can get him to see
                                Nasser if need be, and his contact with the Foreign Office is as
                                good as it's likely to be. He could get around more freely, and
                                reporting might improve somewhat. Resumption of relations won't make
                                non-official contacts and a sense of what Egyptians really feel any
                                freer in that totalitarian society than they were before June. In
                                short, resumption would bring a <hi rend="italic">limited but not
                                    dramatic gain.</hi>

                            <label>2.</label>

                                <hi rend="italic">If resuming relations will help improve our
                                    position in the Arab world generally, then it's worth
                                    resuming</hi>. One can easily argue that resumption in Cairo
                                will lead to resumption at least in Baghdad, Khartoum and maybe in
                                Algiers and make it a little easier for the Kuwaitis to go on doing
                                business with us. But, of course, the main obstacle to improved
                                US-Arab relations is our failure so far (in Arab eyes) to get
                                Israeli troops off Arab soil, and that will remain so. We have to
                                remember that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, the
                                instinctive revolutionary, will not change his stripes: we'll still
                                be the imperialist enemy for <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                                    >Nasser</persName> and all his followers. In short, we should
                                probably recognize that resumption of relations is of <hi
                                    rend="italic">limited symbolic value</hi>.</item>

                                    for a peace settlement, then it's worth resuming</hi>. I must
                                confess, I don't see much argument for this at all. I'm not so
                                confident as some others that Nasser is too weak to negotiate a
                                settlement. But I'm pretty sure we won't have much influence on that
                                anyway. I do believe that, since <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                                    >Nasser</persName> will always be <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                                    >Nasser</persName>, he's nothing reliable to pin our peace
                                arrangements on. The point here is that we don't have much choice;
                                we have to work with whoever is in power. The only question is
                                whether resumption of relations strengthens him appreciably. I think
                                its effect would be marginal.</item>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">What this adds up to</hi> is that we feel instinctively
                        that resuming relations would marginally improve our position, practically
                        and symbolically. It's hardly likely to net us much more. On the other hand,
                        since we can't be confident that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                            >Nasser</persName> will fall soon, it might cost us too much to wait out

                                corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> our talks with <persName
                                corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> confirmed our impression he was
                            not entirely happy with Israeli position re “acceptance” of <gloss
                                target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> resolution. We had impression that if
                            things should blow up he would report critically on manner in which
                            Israelis had expressed acceptance. <persName>Rostow</persName> said
                                <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> was trying to work out
                            formula which hopefully would bring parties together. In dealing with
                            acceptance question, Israel should be most careful to avoid being put in
                            trap of having blame put on it if <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                                >Jarring</persName> does not succeed. We agree Israel cannot accept

                            said; we regard resolution as whole and as requiring negotiations. He
                            emphasized however that present moment is critical in peace efforts. He
                            said we could see no advantage in not being simple and definitive in
                            accepting resolution and undertaking to implement it through
                            agreement.</item>

                        <item>Rostow said Spanish had informed us March 4 that Riad during Madrid
                            visit had said <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> did not insist on
                            prior withdrawal and would accept resolution as package. At same time,
                            Spanish reported <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> very reserved as to
                            next step if Israel “accepts” resolution. We gave Spaniards message to
                            convey back to <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> to effect that next
                            step should be Rhodes-type meeting on Cyprus. We did not attach much
                            importance to Spanish message.</item>

                        <item>Rostow then turned to recent Israeli orders re West Bank. Said they
                            had caused commotion and turbulence affecting atmosphere of <pb n="212"
                                xml:id="pg_212" facs="0240"/>negotiations.
                                <persName>Rostow</persName> said that, against background of talks
                            between President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> and
                            Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName>, US felt it

                            this kind arise. He pointed out that, though we and Israel were agreed
                            on the issue of peace, we had been caught by surprise in this way on
                            number of occasions. He mentioned as earlier example regulations re
                            Jerusalem. We headed off consequences of such acts with great effort. In
                            present case, we could not be persuaded that measures affecting West
                            Bank were needed to fill legal void; any such void had existed so far
                            and could do so a while longer.</item>

                        <item>Rostow informed <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> that US

                            He said expropriation and building in Jerusalem create doubt concerning
                            negotiability of Jerusalem question. When <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1"
                                >Rabin</persName> raised question whether Israel in fact considered

                            seeking define Jerusalem policy at this juncture. We recognized it was
                            the most difficult item and would have to be last on the agenda. We had

                            which seemed hold open possibility of negotiations concerning it.
                            Meanwhile, it was important avoid precluding such negotiations. He
                            recalled that Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KNB1"
                                >Katzenbach</persName> had told <persName corresp="#p_EA1"
                                >Eban</persName> that we would support position that City should not
                            be redivided but that we took very serious view of interests of others
                            including Jordan. Current Israeli actions on the ground cause doubt re
                            negotiability he continued. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BW1"
                                >Barbour</persName> had been instructed to request that
                            expropriation and construction be suspended. <persName>Rostow</persName>
                            requested <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> convey to <gloss

                            this question. He said <persName corresp="#p_BW1">Barbour</persName>
                            would also be bringing up subject of refugees from West Bank. Security
                            Council session could result from Israeli actions in any of these
                            respects, <persName>Rostow</persName> said, and it could happen that US

                        <item>Turning to question of Rhodes formula, <persName>Rostow</persName>
                            urged Israelis not to stick to particular modality. He said we saw no
                            advantage for Israel in insisting on face to face meetings with Arabs on
                            Cyprus instantly or exclusively. <persName>Rostow</persName> referred to
                            President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s statement
                            June 19 that we were ready to see any method tried. President had
                            appealed for adoption of no rigid views on these matters.
                                <persName>Rostow</persName> said it would be disaster if this
                            opportunity for peace—which might be the only one—foundered on an issue
                            which not fully understood in the world and which not compatible with US

                            <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> replied that Israel
                            interested in peace, but in real peace. He noted that in 1956 there had
                            been no change in basic relationships. Israeli willingness to accept
                            Rhodes formula represented withdrawal <pb n="213" xml:id="pg_213"
                                facs="0241"/>from earlier Israeli position on direct talks, but by
                            Rhodes formula Israel meant that parties came to Rhodes for purpose of
                            negotiating settlement between two sides. Israel prepared negotiate
                            “practically everything” under <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                                >Jarring</persName>'s Chairmanship. He claimed US position re Rhodes
                            was departure from Rhodes model which was matter of history.
                                <persName>Rostow</persName> replied US had not attempted define
                            Rhodes formula. We had same purpose; negotiations among or between
                            parties. On Rhodes parties met in various ways. Main thing was initiate
                            process which would result in negotiations.</item>

                        <item>Rabin gave usual Israeli argumentation re return of West Bank
                            refugees. He then added as personal comment that it was important recall
                            that Israel had not initiated the war. To have peace, he said, Arabs
                            must be taught that once you start war you lose something. Starting war
                            meant not only taking risk of not achieving goal but also of suffering
                            loss. Re measures in occupied territory <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1"
                                >Rabin</persName> conceded they might be mistake from public
                            relations point of view but he insisted that they not intended change
                            status of those areas in present or future. <persName>Rostow</persName>
                            said that while they might not be intended to effect change of status,
                            political consequences could be very serious and must be dealt with. He
                            reiterated that we had asked Israelis to take steps to remove widespread
                            feeling that Israelis did not intend to withdraw from occupied

                    <p>As I mentioned yesterday on the phone, the <gloss target="#t_GUAR1"
                            >GUAR</gloss> is fudging the <hi rend="italic">Look</hi> retraction of
                        the “big lie.”<note n="2" xml:id="d104fn2">See <ref target="#d91fn2"
                                >footnote 2, Document 91</ref>.</note> First, they altered the
                        crucial admission to read-instead of “you could say that, yes”-“you could
                        say that, but someone else may say something else.” Then their spokesman
                        said that resumption of US-<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> relations is
                        “not at present an issue that is being considered” and that the
                        “extraordinary” support extended by the US to Israel does not signify that
                        the US shows any interest in maintaining friendly relations with the
                        Arabs.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BDC1">Don Bergus</persName> suggests several reasons
                        for this hedging. One obviously is that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                            >Nasser</persName> doesn't like to admit to his people he's wrong.
                        Another is the persistent <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> effort to hope
                        it can use resumption to change our position.</p>
                    <p>My own view is shared in <gloss target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss>, is that this
                        fudging need not destroy the usefulness of the Look article. I think we can
                        go ahead and tell Bergus we consider this the best we're going to get, so we
                        can drop this issue but still leave the initiative with <persName
                            corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>. Most of us doubt he will rush into
                        our arms.</p>
                    <p>This isn't entirely throwing in the towel. The news of <persName
                            corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s retraction is getting through to
                        the Arabs. The Egyptian press and radio have altered the interview some, but
                        not enough to raise any doubts that Nasser now admits the original charge
                        was untrue. In Cairo, Tunis, Khartoum, Benghazi and other places the Attwood
                        interview has been the story, and even Sheikh Isa of Bahrain is aware of the
                        retraction. We don't have reports from all the Arab countries, but Algeria
                        is the only place we know of where the Look article is being ignored. Major
                        play given to it in international broadcasts-particularly by <gloss
                            target="#t_BBC1">BBC</gloss>-is spreading the news no matter what Arab
                        governments do.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, I think we're over one hurdle, but we may not be much closer to
                        actual resumption. We may disagree somewhat on the value <pb n="215"
                            xml:id="pg_215" facs="0243"/>of resumption (my view attached),<note

                                entered a critical phase, in which the full support of the United

                                        <ref target="#d57">Document 57</ref>.</note> emphasized the
                                President's concern at the extensive supply of weapons from the
                                Soviet Union and noted the pressures on the United States Government
                                to take similar action. We consider it highly desirable to agree
                                upon limitation of arms shipments to the area as soon as possible.
                                We are therefore prepared promptly to <pb n="216" xml:id="pg_216"
                                    facs="0244"/>discuss with the Soviet Union in a positive spirit
                                the establishment of limitations on arms shipments. Any progress we
                                can make in this regard would hardly fail to facilitate the
                                achievement of a just and lasting peace in the Middle East.</p>
                            <p>We are concerned that the Soviet Union still appears to adhere to the
                                position that a peaceful settlement in the Middle East depends upon
                                prior withdrawal of Israeli forces to the lines existing before June
                                5, 1967. We believe that your position, that such Israeli withdrawal
                                must be the first and basic point, is not consistent with the
                                Security Council Resolution of November 22. The Security Council
                                Resolution clearly recognizes the interrelationship between Israeli
                                withdrawal, agreement upon secure and recognized boundaries, the
                                termination of belligerency, respect for and acknowledgment of the
                                sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of
                                every state in the area, guarantees of freedom of innocent maritime
                                passage, and progress in solving the refugee problem. There is
                                nothing artificial about the interrelationship of these elements; it
                                is in the nature of the situation and of the history of this
                                conflict. The principles enunciated in the Security Council
                                Resolution point the way from an uncertain armistice to a durable
                                and stable peace. Taken together they form the basis for a lasting
                                settlement. They reflect the policy publicly stated by President
                                    <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> on June 19, 1967,
                                explained personally to Chairman Kosygin at Glassboro, and more
                                recently reaffirmed in detail by Ambassador <persName
                                    corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> in his discussion with
                                Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> on
                                February 28. The essential aim of this policy is to replace the
                                Armistice regime of 1949 with an agreed and accepted settlement
                                assuring a just and durable peace.</p>
                            <p>The history of the Palestine problem makes all too clear the
                                necessity for such an agreed and accepted settlement by the parties.
                                The US, as you well know, was primarily responsible for obtaining
                                withdrawal of Israeli forces in 1957. The international
                                understanding, on the basis of which Israeli forces were withdrawn,
                                was that the Straits of Tiran would be and would remain open to
                                ships of all nations including Israel. The <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                                    >UAR</gloss> last May asserted that this international
                                understanding was never formally accepted by it, and therefore was
                                not binding. Its repudiation of this international understanding,
                                which led directly to the recent conflict, demonstrates the
                                necessity for engaging and committing the parties directly in a
                                settlement of the issues currently in controversy.</p>
                            <p>What is vital, in our view, is that the opportunities for peace
                                opened up by the passage of the Security Council Resolution of
                                November 22, 1967 and the appointment of Ambassador Jarring, should
                                be constructively used. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                                    >Jarring</persName> has made limited progress, but the
                                possibility now exists for advancing to a next stage in which <pb
                                    n="217" xml:id="pg_217" facs="0245"/>the parties would carry on
                                negotiations and discussions under his auspices on Cyprus. If the
                                permanent members of the Security Council, and other states, give
                                him unstinting support we believe the prospects for peace are good.
                                For its part the United States Government is giving him such
                                support. We have endeavored to persuade both sides in the dispute to
                                move forward by negotiating, under his auspices, agreements on all
                                the elements encompassed by the Security Council resolution.</p>
                            <p>We would hope that you would use your influence with the <gloss
                                    target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> to accept the idea of the 1949
                                Rhodes-type negotiations. We are confident that, if this pattern of
                                negotiations can be accepted again, it will be possible to surmount
                                the difficulties which have been involved in Ambassador <persName
                                    corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>'s conversations thus far,
                                and permit the parties, at long last, to begin the substantive
                                negotiations so essential for settlement.</p>
                            <p>We strongly urge that the Soviet Union, which has indicated its
                                support of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                                >Jarring</persName>'s Mission, use its diplomatic influence to

                            said. Considered <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> view was that

                            final. Though we could not say this absolutely, we thought it likely.
                            According our info, Riad had never addressed himself directly to
                                <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>'s formulation. Since
                                <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> was merely consulting
                            with <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> on formulation and not formally
                            issuing invitation, if <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> wanted to
                            keep door open Riad could have said he would accept <persName
                                corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> invitation if Israel did so.
                            Instead, Riad's response to <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                                >Jarring</persName> had mixed a number of points. These had included
                            renewed allegation that Israel had not accepted resolution and allusions
                            to necessity of returning to Security Council to force Israeli
                            acceptance, but had also included references to internal stresses in
                                <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and to possibility of major
                            powers' intervening to straighten situation out.</item>

                            U.S.-Soviet exchange would improve its position. Israelis should know
                            that, subsequent to last Riad-Jarring talk, we had sent message to
                            Soviets firmly restating our commitment to durable and lasting peace and
                            emphasizing that any settlement must directly engage and commit parties
                            in order to avoid 1957 Tiran-type arrangements.</item>

                            Tactically, it was important in order for Israel to establish its record

                            persuaded, however, that <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> had given
                                <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> final reply. March 8
                                <hi rend="italic">Haikal</hi> article had noted that Arabs
                            maintained Embassies in Nicosia which could serve as continuing points
                            of contact with <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>. Such a
                            ploy, which would represent no advance from <gloss target="#t_GOI1"
                                >GOI</gloss> viewpoint, could not be ruled out, since <gloss

                            In reply, <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> pointed out
                            that (a) whatever <hi rend="italic">Haikal</hi> may have said, <gloss
                                target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> had not made this point to <persName
                                corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> and (b) this was not <persName
                                corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>'s proposal, which was that
                            parties should send delegations to Cyprus. <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                                >Jarring</persName> would be guided by what Riad, not Haikal said.
                            Riad had said there could be no discussions, direct or indirect, in
                            Rhodes-type situation. Present <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                            position was that Rhodes talks had dealt with Armistice Agreements
                            whereas what Israel now wanted was peace treaty. This <gloss
                                target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> viewed as surrender and therefore
                            unacceptable unless Israel first withdrew its troops.<note n="2"

                            he urged us to be prepared to intervene in Lebanese Parliamentary

                            fact. To date, Frangieh admitted, external intervention is within
                            manageable proportions. Stated <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                            definitely intervening but at lower level than in past elections.</item>

                        <item>Frangieh agreed US policy wise and correct under present
                            circumstances. He emphasized strongly that US should be prepared
                            intervene if there is external intervention of any magnitude on part of
                            others. Explained that under such circumstances there strong possibility
                            composition of new Parliament would be weighted heavily on side of
                            leftists and Nasserists and that such development would upset <gloss
                                target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss>'s goal to have balance of forces in
                            Parliament. Frangieh stressed that such development, in his opinion,
                            would also be contrary to US self-interest and stated that if external
                            intervention occurs “US has the obligation to intervene” and should be
                            prepared to do so. Frangieh claimed <gloss target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss>
                            does not have sufficient means to combat external intervention on any
                            significant scale.</item>

                    <p>3770. 1. It is now getting on to four months since the adoption of the
                        Security Council resolution of Nov 22. Most recent reports from Cairo, Tel
                        Aviv, and <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss> indicate that we are further
                        than ever away from implementation of that resolution and may soon be back
                        in <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>2. In late summer we decided at least temporarily to close down “Sandstorm”
                        and began to pursue present policy of seeking a multilateral Arab-Israeli
                        settlement. In making this shift we of course recognized the difficulty of
                        getting individual Arab states which, after all, have quite different
                        interests in a final settlement, to agree on a concerted approach to dealing
                        with Israel. Indeed, the difficulty of obtaining such an Arab consensus has
                        been one of the principal lessons of the past twenty years.</p>
                    <p>3. Over the years we have also been very much aware of another lesson—that it
                        is impossible for a leader of one of the smaller Arab states, such as
                        Lebanon or Jordan, to make a separate peace with Israel and survive.
                        Particularly in Jordan, the fate of King Abdullah always comes to mind. We
                        doubt that the situation has changed today. A separate peace would still
                        entail extremely grave risks for the Arab leader who appeared to contemplate
                        it. The most moderate and reasonable Jordanians we talk to see separate
                        talks only as a last, desperate resort.</p>
                    <p>4. We know quite well that King <persName>Hussein</persName> and many
                        Jordanian leaders want a peaceful settlement. From the very beginning of the
                            <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> Mission (even though they
                        may have played with words during the first meeting with <persName
                            corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> in order to save their honor and
                        their reputations with fellow Arabs) we have known that the Jordanians
                        accepted the resolution and wanted to move to practical next steps.</p>
                    <p>5. Meanwhile, the situation in presently truncated Jordan can only worsen,
                        particularly because Israel continues to follow policies tending to
                        consolidate, at least in Arab eyes, its occupation of the West Bank.
                        Unfortunately, the manipulative strategy followed by Israel (that is
                        retaliatory raids to “teach Jordan a lesson,” official and semi-official
                        threats linked with retaliation, and public surfacing of contacts with <pb
                            n="224" xml:id="pg_224" facs="0252"/>Arabs or easing of Arab stands)
                        tends to compound current difficulties faced by Jordan's leaders. In our
                        view, although terrorism in future may not become any more effective in
                        Israel or in the occupied territory, it seems bound to increase because of
                        policies Israel itself is following. And the post-Feb 15 developments have
                        shown that it is going to become more and more difficult for the Jordan
                        regime to suppress it. Moreover, the terrorists pose a major threat to the
                        Jordanian regime itself. We can only conclude from here that if present
                        stalemate in the <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> Mission
                        continues, we will not only have failed to achieve a multilateral settlement
                        under <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>'s aegis, but more
                        important, we will also have substantially diminished the chances for moving
                        successfully towards a bilateral Jordan-Israel settlement. The outlook for a
                        stable and independent Jordan will become even more bleak.</p>
                    <p>6. Foregoing suggests the time may have come to consider again whether to
                        encourage Israel and Jordan to seek a bilateral settlement. I recognize of
                        course that this is not an either-or matter. It might well be possible and
                        desirable, for example, to encourage Jordan-Israel contacts under a moribund
                            <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> effort. In other words, we
                        could pay lip service to what might be an obviously dead <persName
                            corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> Mission but still use latter as
                        cloak for contacts. There would obviously be other possible variations. I am
                        certain we will find considerable resistance to any kind of separate
                        bilateral settlement from many prominent Jordanians. As time goes on I would
                        expect such opposition to increase rather than to diminish, principally
                        because Israel's position would have hardened. Recognizing there are
                        possibilities for talks short of outright, secret contacts, I believe if as
                        a last resort we were prepared to tell the King we saw no chance of forward
                        motion by other means and that we were prepared to protect him if he moved
                        towards a settlement with Israel, he might decide to take this step. I would
                        be opposed to our making such an approach however, unless we had first
                        obtained from the Israelis a clear and unequivocal statement in detailed
                        terms of what they would be prepared initially to offer
                            <persName>Hussein</persName>. By this I mean, for example, that we would
                        have to get from Israel a clear minimum commitment as to what they were
                        prepared to give Jordan with regard to Jerusalem. This minimum commitment
                        would have to be specific in terms of lines on the ground, access, economic
                        modalities, and aspects of sovereignty. It would have to be subject to some
                        discussion. In other words, we would need to be able to say to the King that
                        Israel was at least committed to do what it had said but that we would also
                        hope in discussions Israel might have some add-ons to its minimum position.
                        We would also need specifics with regard to where the Israelis expect to
                        redraw West Bank borders, what they actually mean by demilitarization, and
                        whether they would be prepared to consider something like the Joseph Johnson
                        plan for <pb n="225" xml:id="pg_225" facs="0253"/>refugees.<note n="2"

                        Unless we could obtain such specific statements from Israel, I would be
                        opposed to our approaching the King on bilateral negotiations. In fact, I
                        wonder if we should not now seek to elicit what Israel is prepared to offer
                        against contingencies short of outright, secret contacts.</p>
                    <p>7. I wish to make clear I am not by any means suggesting we should align
                        ourselves with Jordan to act as Jordan's agent in the negotiating process
                        itself. I do believe, however, that the King and the officials who might go
                        along with him have everything to lose by moving to anything smacking of
                        separate peace and that they therefore deserve to have from us and from the
                        Israelis through us a guaranteed floor for commencing the negotiations. The
                        substance of such direct contacts that previously have taken place between
                        Jordan and Israel (at least those of which we are aware) largely have been
                        devoid of detail. We gather that the King has found Israeli generalizations
                        brought over by emissaries such as Nuseibeh quite unattractive for this
                        reason.</p>
                    <p>8. If we were to move towards bilateral negotiations, I think we should be
                        prepared with contingency plans for helping to handle civil strife and
                        efforts by other Arab states to interfere. I would suggest we give thought
                        immediately to this kind of contingency planning in any case because King
                            <persName>Hussein</persName> might well move towards bilateral
                        negotiations without our encouragement.</p>
                    <p>9. Finally, we would have to have ironclad assurances from the Israelis with
                        regard to (1) publicity (before, during, and after talks-particularly if the
                        talks should be inconclusive the Israelis would have to avoid surfacing the
                        contacts) and (2) cessation of manipulative activities (such as retaliation
                        and threats) at least during the course of the talks.</p>

                        <item>When I saw King <persName>Hussein</persName> on thirteenth on another
                            matter, I mentioned I was worried about recrudescence of terrorist
                            incidents in past few days. I said our information indicated that
                            terrorists are still operating in strength in Jordan valley area. Given
                            past patterns I feared another Israeli retaliation. Recognizing his
                            policy against terrorism, I thought there might be other helpful step to
                            take. For one thing he had told me he wanted Iraqi troops out. He had
                            said as soon as he knew US arms were forthcoming he would be in strong
                            position to get Iraqis out. I hoped he would start with 421 Palestine
                            Battalion. Secondly, I hoped news that Col. <persName corresp="#p_DCM1"
                                >Daoud</persName> is back in town meant Jordan would agree to
                            Daoud's meeting with Israelis. This might not prevent all incidents, but
                            it would be a helpful factor.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>King responded that for everything he did to curtail terrorists
                            Israelis seemed to do two things that resulted in strengthening them.
                            Israeli unilateral actions and particularly their retaliatory actions
                            greatly weaken Jordan argument that they do not need the Iraqis. The
                            Iraqi Chief of Staff is expected in Jordan soon, however, and King would
                            do what he could to start Iraqi troops on the way out. He hoped Israel
                            meanwhile would not make this impossible.</item>

                        <item>On Daoud, the King said he would look into the matter as soon as the
                            Jordan Cabinet has been reconstituted. Laughingly he said he <pb n="230"
                                xml:id="pg_230" facs="0258"/>would he happy to put Daoud in

                            <persName>Hussein</persName> agreed that the terrorists are hurting the
                            Arab cause far more than they help it. He said he could argue this
                            proposition with other Arabs much more convincingly if he could point to
                            some progress in achieving peaceful settlement under <persName

                        <item>(Resume <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>'s remarks.) <gloss
                                target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> believes that account of
                            conversation with <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> is
                            self-explanatory and should answer <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1"
                                >Goldberg</persName>'s comments. It clearly sets forth the <gloss
                                target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> position on the Security Council
                            resolution, a position known to the US Government over an extended
                            period. Therefore, it was with surprise and indeed dismay that <gloss
                                target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> noted there seemed to be a deliberate
                            attempt on the part of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1"
                                >Goldberg</persName> to confuse the issue and worse still to confuse
                            the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> position—a position which is
                            clear and honest. It is to be noted that the adoption of the Security
                            Council resolution took place after lengthy discussions between
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> and <gloss
                                target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>. These discussions concluded on
                            note that <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> resolution should be

                            resolution? If this is case, <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> cannot
                            but take note with dismay of such a position. <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                                >UAR</gloss>'s definite aim, which is also aim of international
                            community, is to reach peaceful settlement through honest implementation
                            of resolution. This cannot be achieved except through an explicit and
                            formal declaration by the parties. The <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                                >UAR</gloss> has made such a declaration and it is to be noted that
                            it has done so not today, not yesterday, not last week, not last month,
                            but since first visit of <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>
                            to Cairo. Meanwhile and through all this Israel has evaded doing the

                            peaceful settlement the parties should take clear stands as regards
                            implementation of the Security Council resolution. In all fairness and
                            honesty, such a stand could not and should not be criticized. On the

                        <item>The US in taking the position as conveyed by <persName

                            negotiations. <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> must
                            remember that <pb n="232" xml:id="pg_232" facs="0260"/>since its
                            aggression last June, Israel insisted on negotiations. Yet nevertheless
                            the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> resolution when adopted,
                            completely ignored this approach and requested the parties to implement
                            its provisions through the Special Representative. Hence the issue of
                            negotiations is neither relevant nor pertinent.</item>

                                <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> said he could not put
                            pressure on Israel because it was a sovereign state. <gloss
                                target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> had replied that he did not ask
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> to do that but that
                            all he asked was that <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>
                            declare US position regarding aggression and withdrawal. Unfortunately,
                            US refused to take such a stand. To refresh memories on this point and

                        <item>Secondly, I said that just as consistently as <gloss target="#t_UAR1"

                            that resolution itself clearly implied some sort of discussion among the

                            formula as presented to Riad carried as its point a statement that
                                <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and Israel have accepted the
                            Security Council resolution. Subsequent to March 7 <gloss
                                target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has informed <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                                >UAR</gloss> in Washington, New York and Cairo that Israelis have
                            accepted <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> formula. Does
                            this not carry us past the point of acceptance which <gloss
                                target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> has been stressing and to the stage of
                            required discussions? <persName corresp="#p_RM2">Mohamed</persName> said
                            that while <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> had informed <gloss
                                target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> of Israelis' acceptance, <persName
                                corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> had not done so. I immediately
                            asked that if <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> did so, what
                            would <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>'s position be. <persName

                            but again noted that only word for Israel acceptance had come from
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> and not from Jarring.</item>

                            <ref target="#d109">Document 109</ref>.</note> from Harry Symmes deals
                        with the other side of the question we wrote you about yesterday—what we
                        might have to do to make it possible for <persName>Hussein</persName> to
                        negotiate with Israel. Yesterday we considered whether it's possible for him
                        to go it alone and leaned toward concluding that chances of his talking
                        alone are a good bit less than even. Now Harry is writing about how to
                        improve the chances.</p>
                    <pb n="234" xml:id="pg_234" facs="0262"/>
                    <p>Harry feels that, to get <persName>Hussein</persName> to the negotiating
                        table, we would have to get a specific statement from the Israelis on the
                        minimum they are willing to offer and would have to agree to protect
                            <persName>Hussein</persName> from the dangers of talking to Israel. He
                        specifically mentions contingency plans for helping to handle civil strife
                        and efforts by other Arab states to interfere.</p>
                    <p>We'll have to think this through, but it's plain that Harry is not just
                        talking about more barbed wire to use against infiltrators at the proper
                        time. Hussein would probably want clear indication that we will do what is
                        necessary to save him, not that we will make friendly gestures.</p>
                    <p>Obviously, we're not going to be able to make him feel completely safe. The
                        one thought I (HHS) have for bucking him up is based on an interesting
                        comment to me the other day by an intelligent Lebanese. He says the Arab
                        governments are increasingly reluctant to settle the broad Palestine
                        question without the participation of the Palestinians. When I asked whether
                        anybody really took seriously the thought that the Palestinians could
                        organize a responsible representation in settlement negotiations, he said
                        that the ouster of Shuquairy and the evolution of a collegial <gloss
                            target="#t_PLO1">PLO</gloss> leadership was designed to do just
                        this.</p>
                    <p>The thought that occurs to me is that if <persName>Hussein</persName> needs
                        support for negotiating alone the Palestinians might provide it. Jordan and
                        Israel-not the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>-are sitting on most
                        aspects of the Palestine problem. If Hussein could say he was negotiating
                        with or on behalf of representative Palestinians who wanted peace, he might
                        have some added backing.</p>
                    <p>We're still better off pursuing our present course-trying to get the <gloss
                            target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> back on the <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                            >Jarring</persName> track both directly and via
                            <persName>Hussein</persName>. But if that fails, we'll be looking for
                        ideas like this. I've checked fairly widely in State and <gloss
                            target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> and no one thinks this is a wild idea. In
                        fact, <persName>Hussein</persName> himself is already trying to bring more
                        Palestinians into his government. The problems are that: (a) Palestinian
                        leadership is fragmented so he couldn't hope to have unanimous support; and
                        (b) if <persName>Hussein</persName> gets too involved with <gloss
                            target="#t_PLO1">PLO</gloss>-type Palestinians, it could mean the end of
                        Jordan via encouragement for a separate Palestine. But
                            <persName>Hussein</persName> today is a man with no attractive
                        alternatives, and this risk may be less than the risk of no movement at
                        all.</p>
                    <p>If we do get back into the area of Jordan-Israel negotiations, Jerusalem will
                        be the main sticking point, and we will have to trot out again all the
                        thoughts you had on Jordan-Israel economic cooperation.</p>

                            He did not mean this as criticism; it was quite natural and was due in

                            meeting in Amman, as he had done previous day for Tekoah. He noted in
                            particular following points. <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                                >Jarring</persName>, according to Jordanian report, had not
                            characterized <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> response as negative
                                (<persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>'s conception of his
                            role would not permit such characterization in any case). <persName
                                corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> had said Cairo put strong
                            emphasis on implementing resolution and putting it into action.
                                <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> had said he was
                            pessimistic, not just because of Cairo's reaction but because of
                            atmosphere in totality, implication being, <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1"
                                >Goldberg</persName> added, that his pessimism also based on Israeli
                            position. According to Jordanians, <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                                >Jarring</persName> said <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName>
                            had told him he thought Israeli cabinet could be persuaded to accept
                            resolution. However, <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> had
                            said he could not get statement from <persName corresp="#p_EA1"
                                >Eban</persName> that Israel would implement it. <persName

                            <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> told <persName
                                corresp="#p_EE1">Evron</persName> Israel must be careful not to put
                            itself in political box. Israel had enjoyed good political position for
                            past few days because of its affirmative reaction to <persName
                                corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> formula, but now we had new
                            situation with introduction of Jordanian modification. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> urged that Israel say “yes” to
                            this formula but at same time protect itself by rephrasing second
                            element concerning implementation. Israel could say it understood that
                            Rhodes-type talks were intended and that implementation would come about
                            pursuant to para 3 of <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> resolution,
                            meaning there would have to be an agreed settlement. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> noted this would amount to tying
                            in acceptance and implementation with pursuing these through Rhodes-type
                            negotiations and in accordance with para 3 of resolution. He said this
                            would take teeth out of idea that implementation could come by fiat
                            without negotiation. <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>
                            said his proposal, in capsule, was that there must be agreed
                            implementation-agreed between parties. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1"
                                >Sisco</persName> commented Israel should build on Jordanian
                            statement that Jordan has always accepted resolution as package. He said
                            if our suggestion followed, there no way Israel could get hurt.</item>

                            <persName corresp="#p_EE1">Evron</persName> said his off-hand reaction
                            was that Israel would be taking very dangerous course to do this. <gloss
                                target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> still said withdrawal came first.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> said Israel would
                            reject that. <persName corresp="#p_EE1">Evron</persName> continued that
                            if <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> said he would not blame
                            either side, Israel was then boxed in. If all <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                                >Jarring</persName> did was report two views without saying which
                            was in accord with resolution, Israeli position would be eroded.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> reiterated that formula
                            we proposed would not hook Israel and Israel would not find U.S. taking
                            position that it did. With respect to <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                                >Jarring</persName> statement that it not his job to blame either
                            side, <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> noted that factual
                            accounting by <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> would show
                            where balance lay. <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>
                            pointed out <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> no arbitrator;
                            he would not interpret resolution for <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>.
                            Israel must see to it that its political position was protected and
                            affirmative. He noted Israel had crossed a bridge when it said it could
                            take first part of formula-acceptance; it should not let implementation
                            trip it up now. Goldberg concluded with comment that there were many
                            ways to write formula that would protect Israel and that with such
                            formula he did not see how Israelis could be vulnerable.<note n="4"

                                <persName corresp="#p_BW1">Barbour</persName> pressed the Israeli
                                Government to accept the revised formula, but the Israeli response
                                was that the word implementation had taken on a specific meaning in
                                Arab pronouncements and that without language agreeing to
                                negotiations as well, Israel could not endorse the proposed formula.

                            They would cite terrorism as pretext. With fall of East Bank, West Bank
                            would quickly come to terms. In procession <gloss target="#t_UAR1"

                    <p>The Israelis are mobilizing on the Jordanian border. Wally Barbour has seen
                            <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName>, and Nick Katzenbach called
                        in <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> to make a strong pitch
                        against an attack on Jordan. <persName corresp="#p_BW1">Barbour</persName>
                        believes the final Israeli decision has not yet been made, and holds out the
                        possibility they may decide to stop with a show of force. He gives us less
                        than an even chance of holding them back.</p>
                    <p>This quick Israeli action grows out of rapidly mounting concern over
                        continuing Arab terrorism. They just don't believe
                            <persName>Hussein</persName> has made a real effort to damp down on
                        terrorists. We surmise that they have been debating whether to hit him
                        again—even harder than on February 15—or to try to solve the problem some
                        other way. We suspect the argument within the Israeli government has been
                        pretty evenly matched. Then when an Israeli school bus hit a mine Monday and
                        two Israeli soldiers were killed in similar sabotage incidents, the pressure
                        for retaliation became all but irresistible.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Hussein</persName> has asked for our help in holding the Israelis
                        off. He fears a major Israeli attack could be the end of him and kill the

                                convinced, however, that a military reprisal against Jordan would be
                                a major miscalculation. Such action would have destructive
                                consequences for our common hopes for peace and for the future of
                                our own as well as your position in the Near East.</p>

                                    delivered the President's message even though military
                                    operations had begun in order to reinforce U.S. opposition to
                                    Israeli military reprisals. (Telegram 2983 from Tel Aviv, March

                                    had begun, he had responded to it by doing everything he could
                                    to localize and limit the operations and to ensure that
                                    civilians were not harmed. He justified the operations as a
                                    necessary reaction to terrorism and expressed the hope that they
                                    would help to stabilize the situation. Barbour reiterated the
                                    U.S. view that military retaliation to terrorism only
                                    exacerbated the problem. (Telegram 2991 from Tel Aviv, March 21;

                            <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName> reviewed terrorist

                        stressing “gruesome attack” on children March 18.</p>
                    <p>3. Fatah had developed from clandestine to “open, blatant, organized, and
                        virtually legalized operations under King <persName>Hussein</persName>'s
                        eyes.” Awareness of Fatah's spring and summer plans made action
                        imperative.</p>
                    <p>4. Leaders of Jordan tolerating and sometimes encouraging “second army” which
                        violating <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> security, having no cease fire
                        or international obligations, threatening Jordan's independence, and

                        Jordan.</p>
                    <p>6. <gloss target="#t_IDF1">IDF</gloss> was ordered not harm civilians, and
                        this restriction cost Israel heavy price. <persName>Hussein</persName>

                    <p>7. King now better able consolidate cease-fire and move toward negotiated

                    <p>After weeks of negotiation, the Jordan Arms package is ready for signing.
                        Nick Katzenbach would like to authorize Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_SHM1">Symmes</persName> to sign tomorrow but does not want
                        to go ahead without our OK. The plan is to do this without publicity for the
                        moment.</p>
                    <p>As you know, this negotiation has gone on for some weeks. It just happens
                        that all the details are now wrapped up. It may not be the best time in view
                        of continuing terrorist attacks and last week's Israeli raid. However, there
                        may not be any good time, and the main purpose of this exercise is to
                        bolster <persName>Hussein</persName>. The equipment involved in this deal
                        will not arrive in Jordan for some time.</p>
                    <p>For balance, Luke Battle has rescheduled the signing of the Israeli PL-480
                        agreement for this Friday morning.<note n="2" xml:id="d125fn2">The <gloss

                    <p>My own feeling is that our public, especially the Jewish community, has
                        accepted the resumption of military sales to Jordan. I doubt that the simple
                        act of signing will cause much additional reaction, even if it leaks out.
                        The press already writes as if the deal has long since been wrapped up.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, I recommend that we tell State to go ahead. But I do not wish to
                        do so without informing you.<note n="3" xml:id="d125fn3">The President

                            efforts, as we oppose retaliatory raids just as we do terrorism, but we
                            are not sanguine that these efforts will prevail with <gloss
                                target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> for long in the absence of a serious
                            and successful effort on the part of the Arabs to reduce sharply the
                            incidence of terrorist activity. Although we appreciate Hussein's
                            problem in controlling terrorism in the absence of progress towards a
                            settlement, we at the same time believe that no Israeli Government can
                            resist internal political pressures for military action if terrorism
                            continues in Israeli territory. Underlining this assessment is British
                            report that Eban told Foreign Secretary Stewart in London on March 25
                            that he realized March 21 raid conflicted with Israel's long-term aim of
                            negotiated settlement, but, given growing intensity of terrorism,
                            security considerations were overriding for <gloss target="#t_GOI1"

                        <item>Just settlement acceptable to both sides is obviously only real
                            solution to terrorist problem and we are actively studying ways we can
                            assist Jarring's efforts towards settlement. However, if terrorism
                            retaliatory raids cycle continues, situation will quickly degenerate to
                            point of no return. We have and will continue to work for more
                            flexibility in Israeli position, but it is imperative that Jordanians
                            demonstrate significant measure of control over terrorist activity.
                            Unfortunately, we have no blueprint to offer the Jordanians for
                            controlling terrorism, but would suggest renewed offer of early secret
                            talks between senior military officers, if necessary under <gloss

                                to a guerrilla war against Israel. There's evidence now that the
                                Israelis are beginning to think this way too, although they feel
                                they must respond to terrorism somehow and don't yet see an
                                alternative.</item>

                                are the Jordanian government. The problem, therefore, is to convince
                                    <persName>Hussein</persName> to stop it or—if he's already
                                convinced but unable—to create conditions which strengthen his hand
                                enough to crack down. We disagree with the Israelis that their
                                military attacks strengthen his hand.</item>

                                him to call the terrorists off, or stop them by force.</item>
                            <item>—One of the <hi rend="italic">main obstacles</hi> to getting
                                Jarring's negotiations started is Israeli inflexibility. One of the
                                main reasons for Israeli inflexibility is the fact that the Cabinet
                                has not taken a formal position on the terms for a peace settlement;
                                    <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName> fears breaking up
                                his coalition but we have assurance that they'll make up their minds
                                the moment there's a glimmer of Arab willingness to talk.</item>
                            <item>—The difficulty with this is that the Arabs aren't likely to talk
                                until somebody assures them there's a workable deal possible at the
                                end of the track. This is what all the haggling over whether Israel
                                accepts the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolution is
                                about.</item>

                        <hi rend="italic">What all this adds up to</hi> is the conclusion of some of
                        us that <hi rend="italic">we should now urge <persName corresp="#p_EL1"
                                >Eshkol</persName> to bite the bullet and make the limited move
                            necessary to give the Arabs the assurance they're looking for</hi>.
                            <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName> would give away nothing of
                        substance; he would risk a Cabinet crisis, possibly for limited gains. But
                        the risk of doing nothing looks a lot worse to us.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">The alternative is to let force play itself out</hi>. The
                        argument for is that only the Israelis will decide to bite the bullet when
                        the pressure of terrorism builds up. The argument against is that we're in a
                        worse position every time Israel strikes back and there's a real danger of
                        the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Security Council voting sanctions
                        against Israel-with us having to decide whether to vote for, abstain or
                        veto. More important, Israel is in a worse position if we don't stop the
                        guerrilla spiral before the Arabs commit themselves to it.</p>
                    <p>The debate was brought to a head today in State when Luke Battle tried to
                        clear a response from the President to <persName corresp="#p_EL1"
                            >Eshkol</persName>'s last message. <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Arthur
                            Goldberg</persName> felt it was too tough for the President. Luke, while
                        fully understanding the President's concerns, feels that any message we send
                        ought to lay out what we see as the serious consequences of Israel's current
                        course.</p>
                    <pb n="252" xml:id="pg_252" facs="0280"/>
                    <p>My own feeling is that if we decide to do nothing to deter the Israelis from
                        further retaliation it ought to be because we've decided consciously to let
                        force play itself out a while longer. We shouldn't do nothing just because
                        State can't work out line of action it feels the President can approve.</p>
                    <p>I don't believe there's any point in just sending another Presidential
                        message for <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName> to disregard. <hi
                            rend="italic">If we approach the Israelis this time, it ought to be with
                            the purpose of working out with them a way to get <persName
                                corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> on the tracks</hi>. I think the
                        only way to do this would be to send someone like Mac Bundy with the most
                        serious words from the President for three or four days of talk in
                        Jerusalem. This need not look like pressure at all. The main focus wouldn't
                        be to restrain them. It's just the only way I can see at this time to decide
                        where we and they are going, and the only place to do that is where
                            <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName> and his Cabinet are.</p>
                    <p>State is considering this idea this afternoon.</p>

                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_EE1">Evron</persName> came in on March 29, at his
                        request, to share his observations from his quick trip to Jerusalem. As
                        usual, our conversation was tabbed as strictly personal and off-the-record.
                        As can be imagined, it dealt mainly with the March 21 Israeli attack on
                        Karameh and Israeli thinking in the aftermath.</p>
                    <p>I began by asking him what the Israelis see at the end of their current
                        course of gradually escalating terrorist raids and retaliatory attacks.
                        Although the results of a military review of the Karameh attack have not
                        been finished, <persName corresp="#p_EE1">Evron</persName> indicated that
                        the Israelis were not necessarily satisfied with that sort of attack as the
                        best means to counter terrorism. He said that they would experiment with
                        other tactics, “such as today's” (at the moment the air and artillery attack
                        south of Lake Tiberias was going on). He also indicated, “in the utmost
                        confidence,” <pb n="253" xml:id="pg_253" facs="0281"/>that the Israelis are
                        building a “fence” from the Dead Sea to Lake Tiberias. (This is the reason
                        for the Israeli request for a large number of anti-personnel mines which he
                        hoped we might free quickly.) Concluding this line of discussion, he was
                        quite ready to admit that these counter-attacks would not stop
                        terrorism.</p>
                    <p>When I said I did not see how the Israelis could expect to stop activities
                        based on land which they do not consistently control, he agreed that the
                        main problem is to convince <persName>Hussein</persName> to do the job. When
                        I said I did not believe that Israel's counter attacks would do that either,
                        he disagreed, but he did not argue as strongly as he usually does when he is
                        convinced of what he is saying.</p>
                    <p>I suggested that, if the military track did not promise a solution, it seemed
                        to me this was all the more reason to get into negotiations. He suggested
                        that more flexibility was needed before that could happen. Then telling him
                        I wanted to ask a very indiscreet question, I asked whether Israel was
                        denied the flexibility necessary to begin negotiations by the fact that the
                        Israeli Government had not yet made up its mind what its position would be.
                        I said it seemed clear to me that what the Arabs were seeking in all this
                        haggling over whether Israel did or did not accept the <gloss
                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolution was some assurance that there was
                        a deal at the end of the road. I realized that Foreign Minister <persName
                            corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> had, through us, passed the word that
                        the Arabs would find Israel ready to negotiate generously, but it was clear
                        that this was not convincing to the Arabs in the current atmosphere. Would
                        an Israeli Government decision now on its negotiating terms enable some such
                        assurance to be made?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_EE1">Evron</persName> answered quite readily,
                        thoughtfully and not emotionally. He said, first, that the moment there was
                        a “glimmer” of Arab willingness to come to the table, the Israeli Government
                        would “make up its mind in a moment.” He said emphatically that the greatest
                        single impression he had brought away from Jerusalem this time was the
                        overriding desire for peace. Having felt this in his early talks there, he
                        asked <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> whether he was right and
                            <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> confirmed his view that
                        everyone is “fed up with all this bloodshed.”</p>
                    <p>Second, however, <persName corresp="#p_EE1">Evron</persName> said he had been
                        considering for months the question of whether Israel should stake out its
                        position before negotiations to encourage them. He said he did not believe
                        this was the right procedure. But his main point was that, in international
                        negotiations, one never lays his cards on the table before negotiations
                        begin. He did not push the usual <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName>
                        line about willingness to negotiate being a necessary sign of an Arab change
                        of heart, although this omission may have been simple oversight.</p>
                    <p>At the end of our conversation, he confirmed that he had described to
                            <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> that questioning of the
                        US-Israeli relationship going on in <pb n="254" xml:id="pg_254" facs="0282"
                        />Washington that he had heard from me before his departure as well as from
                        Harry McPherson. We had both told him that an increasing number of people
                        were more and more troubled over whether this relationship would ever become
                        a two-way street. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> had
                        asked the Israeli Government for certain actions in Jerusalem and on
                        refugees, and his questions have been ignored. We have advised against
                        retaliation, and our advice has been ignored. <persName corresp="#p_EE1"
                            >Evron</persName> said he had arrived in the Foreign Ministry the
                        morning that <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Ave Harman</persName> was giving his
                        final impressions of the US-Israeli relationship. On the basis of <persName
                            corresp="#p_EE1">Evron</persName>'s report and <persName
                            corresp="#p_HA1">Harman</persName>'s comments, <persName
                            corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> at the Cabinet meeting which made the
                        final decision to go ahead with the Israeli raid on Karameh, described this
                        change in the Washington mood to the Cabinet. <persName corresp="#p_EE1"
                            >Evron</persName> felt that this had made some impression since both
                        Minister Begin and <persName corresp="#p_AY1">Allon</persName> had asked
                            <persName corresp="#p_EE1">Evron</persName> later whether what <persName
                            corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> said was true.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_EE1">Evron</persName> at one point during this
                        conversation said that one of the ideas that had occurred to him
                        personally—and he said he had not heard this mentioned in Israel at all, so
                        it was strictly personal-is whether now is not the time for Israel to begin
                        thinking again seriously about a separate Palestinian entity.
                            <persName>Hussein</persName> is so weak that perhaps only the
                        Palestinians can take the lead. Already there are new economic relationships
                        growing up between the towns of old Israel and the former West Bank of
                        Jordan. <persName corresp="#p_EE1">Evron</persName> felt that the
                        Palestinians were beginning to see the economic and other advantages of
                        peace and, if they could be adequately organized, might be just the ones to
                        stand up and take the lead in a settlement that <persName>Hussein</persName>
                        might or might not join later. <persName corresp="#p_EE1">Evron</persName>
                        did not seem to be suggesting a permanent separation of the West Bank from
                        Jordan, but simply a settlement that could be worked out now as a first step
                        in what might become a full settlement with Jordan later on when that was
                        possible.</p>

                        this conversation. First, although Eppie made clear that he had not had time
                        for full talks with the Israeli military after the attack on Karameh, he
                        seemed to confirm that there is some second thinking going on about the
                        effectiveness of Israel's current force. Second, there is obviously a great
                        deal of concern about the American relationship and I wonder whether we
                        might not have more effect on Israel's course than we now feel possible.</p>

                    <p>Our main problem, as you said this morning, is to see how we can use the
                        President's new position to finish as much unfinished business as possible.
                        In the Near East, the main job is how to make concrete progress toward the
                        President's vision of last June 19. With the President's new freedom from
                        politics, I'd suggest that we may be able to use the uncertainties of this
                        period to good advantage in Israel.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Two new factors</hi> are obvious: <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>The President is now more free of Israeli pressure. We shouldn't
                                discount his strong personal determination not to let Israel down,
                                so we have to exclude any dramatic shift in our position. But it's
                                worth considering what we might do now that we couldn't have done
                                last week.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>The President has nothing to bargain with beyond next January.
                                Whatever we do must not depend on committing the US beyond January
                                1969, except for military sales which a new Administration would be
                                bound to honor or a financial commitment (like desalting) with
                                Congress behind it.</item>
                        </list>
                    </p>
                    <p>On balance, I believe the President's increased freedom may be more important
                        than his loss of leverage. His ability to bargain with US support was
                        neutralized by domestic politics. Now he can play on uncertainties about his
                        successor.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Two possible courses</hi> spring to mind: <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>Use the President's increased freedom of maneuver to bring
                                pressure on Israel and begin re-balancing our position toward the
                                Arabs. No successor will have such freedom to create public doubt
                                that Israel can count on us in a Soviet-backed effort to get Arab
                                territory back, curtail our support in the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                    >UN</gloss>, tamper with tax exemption for Israel bonds or
                                whatever else might occur to us.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>Use the President's friendship to advantage—he may be the best
                                friend Israel will have in the White House for some time.</item>
                        </list>
                    </p>
                    <pb n="256" xml:id="pg_256" facs="0284"/>
                    <p>I favor the latter because (a) I don't think the President would want to
                        pressure Israel and (b) because we've never fully and systematically put his
                        friendship on the line in a tough effort to change an Israeli position. Now,
                        if ever, is the time to try. The Israelis are already nervous about
                        approaching the limits of our tolerance, <hi rend="italic">and they might
                            respond to the thought that they might get more support from us now than
                            later.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>One other factor has to go in the hopper: There's not much the President can
                        do on the Arab side. He is tabbed as too pro-Israeli, and our leverage there
                        will increase only as we show we can move Israel.</p>
                    <p>Putting these elements together, I think our best bet is to concentrate on
                        changing Israel's position by persuasion-rather than pressure-enough to give
                            <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> a real chance. That's
                        where the President's influence is greatest.</p>
                    <p>If we take this course, we must be sure that doing something soon is better
                        than letting Mid-East forces play themselves out. I must say I don't take
                        much convincing on this point. It may already be too late for
                            <persName>Hussein</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                            >Nasser</persName> to negotiate and the next Arab summit may commit the
                        Arabs to guerrilla war instead of political solution.</p>

                                    to Jarring's getting started is the Israelis' position that the
                                    Arabs must come to them. In part, <persName corresp="#p_EL1"
                                        >Eshkol</persName> is hiding behind this position to avoid
                                    the Cabinet crisis that forcing a decision on peace terms would
                                    precipitate. The question is whether an Israeli Cabinet decision
                                    now would inject enough new flexibility into the picture to get
                                        <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> going—whether
                                    a hint to assure Hussein and Nasser that there is a deal at the
                                    end of the track would get negotiations going.</p>
                                <p>The answer, of course, hinges on whether there's something at the
                                    end of the road for Israel. No one can guarantee that the Arabs
                                    will—or can—seriously negotiate anything beside withdrawal. But
                                    no one can argue that Israel has given them a fair try, and it's
                                    hard to see how Israel can lose while it sits on the Suez Canal
                                    and the Jordan River.</p>

                                <hi rend="italic">Show tactical flexibility</hi>. The time has come
                                to try to move them a short step back from their absolute position
                                on direct negotiations and from the notion of a package settlement
                                all at once. The President last June 19 specifically did not endorse
                                direct negotiations; nor did he rule out settlement in stages, and
                                Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> spoke to
                                    <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName> on this point at

                    </p>
                    <p>What this adds up to is doing something concrete about what we've been
                        talking about for weeks without result-increasing Israeli flexibility. Maybe
                        we have a chance to cut the Gordian knot now. <hi rend="italic">The point is
                            that the Israelis are “shook” over the President's decision</hi>.

                        Israeli withdrawal, but now may be the time to shoot our wad on a marginal
                        Israeli shift that might be enough to get negotiations going.</p>

                                Jerusalem. If we are to build on the advantages in the President's

                                <hi rend="italic">The line</hi> he would take would be to argue out
                                the consequences of each possible course to persuade the Israelis
                                that the consequences of retaliation and sitting tight are
                                dead-ends. That being the case, pressures in the US are mounting to
                                re-balance our position toward the Arabs before it's too late. That
                                will also be an obvious task for the new President. With London,
                                Paris and Moscow backing away from Israel, it will be dangerous for
                                Israel if the US starts backing away too. Therefore, if Israel will
                                shift its position enough to give negotiations a fair chance, we'll
                                consider meeting Israel's aircraft needs now. This approach would
                                combine a big carrot with a gentle stick urging only a marginal

                        into a guerrilla war that none of us will know how to stop. If the President
                        wants to make one last effort for peace, now is the time. It may already be
                        too late, but the effort won't cost him anything. If we're going to do it,
                        let's do it now and let's send someone like Mac Bundy with the best possible

                    <p>In a study of the Israeli nuclear program, Avner Cohen drew upon the
                        recollections of physicist Edward Teller and the testimony of Carl Duckett,
                        a former <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> Deputy Director for Science and
                        Technology, and explored the question of whether Israel had become a
                        “nuclear-weapon state” in 1968. Teller told Duckett that his contacts in the
                        Israeli scientific community led him to the “personal opinion” and
                        “conjecture” that Israel was in possession of nuclear weapons. Teller was a
                        consultant with the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> and his views
                        informed a National Intelligence <pb n="258" xml:id="pg_258" facs="0286"

                            >CIA</gloss>, that drew the conclusion that Israel had nuclear weapons.

                        Nuclear Regulatory Commission in 1978 that he took the estimate to Director

                    </p>
                    <p>We are deeply concerned over recent developments in the Middle East which are
                        affording the Soviets the opportunity to exploit the situation: the pattern
                        of provocative terrorist activities countered by substantial <pb n="259"
                            xml:id="pg_259" facs="0287"/>Israeli military retaliation; the increased
                        status which the Fedayeen seem to have achieved as a result of these
                        developments; the inability of <persName>Hussein</persName> to deal with
                        this matter and the apparent weakening of his regime; the decline in
                        sympathy for Israel and growing doubts about its peaceful intentions; the
                        inability of <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> to get a dialogue
                        going between Israel and the Arabs resulting from a rigid Israeli posture
                        and the hardening of the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> attitude.</p>
                    <p>In light of the foregoing, we have concluded we must make a more direct
                        effort to arrest and reverse these trends. Our efforts with the parties
                        concerned to take measures to bring greater stability to the cease-fire
                        areas and to begin talks under Jarring's auspices have not been successful.
                        I believe it is now urgent that we raise these appeals to a higher level. We
                        have indications that many Israelis are as concerned as we about the present
                        course of events, and such an effort would strengthen those calling for a
                        reappraisal of Israeli policies, particularly with respect to terrorism. We
                        have therefore recommended to you the early despatch of the attached letters
                        to <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName> and
                            <persName>Hussein</persName>.</p>
                    <p>In addition, it would be highly desirable for you to send to Israel, perhaps
                        some time next week (depending on the results of <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                            >Jarring</persName>'s continuing efforts), an individual who could speak
                        frankly to the Israeli Government regarding recent trends and to explore
                        with them possible steps which could be taken to reverse these trends. The
                        principal short-range purpose of such a trip would be to try to indicate to
                            <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> a willingness to formulate
                        acceptance and implementation of the Security Council resolution in such a
                        way that it at least provides <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>
                        the opportunity to continue his efforts both in Amman and Cairo. While it is
                        problematical that this would get talks started, it would at least help
                        place the onus for failure on the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> rather
                        than Israel. More broadly and fundamentally, such an emissary could try to
                        get across to the Israelis the immediate need for some gesture on their
                        part, at least to Jordan, which will be an overt demonstration to the Arab
                        world of a continuing Israeli interest in a political settlement. This would
                        bolster <persName>Hussein</persName>. As a follow-up to your discussions
                        with <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName>, your emissary could also
                        explore with the Israelis their concrete ideas about a settlement.</p>
                    <p>The U.S. emissary would not take over the mediation effort of <persName
                            corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>. He would support <persName
                            corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>'s efforts, and we would ask
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> to explain this
                        to the Secretary General so that there would be no misunderstanding.</p>
                    <p>Our hope would be that such an emissary would also find it desirable and
                        opportune to discuss matters in Amman and Cairo, though we would not wish to
                        make any final recommendations to you in this regard until we know the
                        results of discussions in Tel Aviv. Since it would be desirable to include
                        Cairo on the itinerary, we believe the individual selected should be a
                        private person in whom you have confidence <pb n="260" xml:id="pg_260"
                            facs="0288"/>rather than a government official. We have three
                        possibilities in mind in the following order of preference: McGeorge Bundy,
                        Robert Murphy, <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">George Ball</persName>.
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> feels, and we
                        agree, that the emissary should have some ostensible reason for the visit
                        other than the actual purpose. In this respect, McGeorge Bundy would be
                        especially suitable since his foundation affairs could quite naturally take
                        him to the Near East.<note n="3" xml:id="d131fn3">In an April 5 memorandum

                        your intervention at this point is regarded as critical are twofold: <list>

                                that <persName>Hussein</persName> has indicated that he is prepared

                                simply will not move unless you personally take a position. He has
                                ignored one intervention after another by <persName

                            >Evron</persName> said mines urgently needed in conjunction with

                        has taken strong public position critical of Israel's military reprisal

                        would seek assurances mines would be used only in connection this project.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DRP1">Davies</persName> said it would be
                        embarrassing if mines of U.S. origin were to be used in countermeasures on

                            >Evron</persName> later complained to White House staff that Department

                    <p>142988. 1. Please convey following message from President to Prime Minister.
                            <hi rend="italic">Begin Message.</hi> Dear Mr. Prime Minister: I have
                        considered your message of March 22<note n="2" xml:id="d134fn2">See <ref
                                target="#d123fn2">footnote 2, Document 123</ref>.</note> with two
                        thoughts uppermost in my mind: deep sympathy for the serious problems which
                        continuing terrorist acts pose for your country; and deep anxiety about the
                        prospects for peace in the Middle East.</p>
                    <p>2. I appreciate, of course, the dilemma which the recent growth of terrorism
                        presents. I believe, however, that military action across ceasefire lines
                        does not deter the type of terrorism you face, but leads to greater
                        insecurity, above all at this critical moment.</p>
                    <p>3. We both recognize, I am sure, that true security for Israel lies only in
                        peace.</p>
                    <pb n="263" xml:id="pg_263" facs="0291"/>
                    <p>4. I believe we are now at a crossroads in this respect in the Near East: the
                        sole peace-making process now available is the <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                            >Jarring</persName> Mission. I am deeply concerned by the lack of
                        tangible results from this mission and the cumulative deterioration of the
                        situation resulting from a growing incidence of terrorism and counter
                        military actions-especially at this delicate moment in the internal life of
                        Jordan.</p>
                    <p>5. I feel, therefore, that there is an urgent need to reverse the present
                        trend—a trend which carries the risk not only of greater and greater
                        violence and insecurity, but indeed of another round of general hostilities,
                        as well as irreparable damage to the <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                            >Jarring</persName> Mission. We wish to see every possible step taken to
                        minimize these risks.</p>
                    <p>6. There is very little time. There is still, however, an opportunity for an
                        active strategy of peace.</p>
                    <p>7. I have just learned of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1"
                            >Goldberg</persName>'s discussion with Ambassador <persName

                        10. I understand that Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_EA1"
                            >Eban</persName> told Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                            >Jarring</persName> at that time that your Government could accept this
                        formulation. I urge you most strongly to make your acceptance clear to
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>. The King believes
                        it would greatly enhance the possibility of his success with <persName

                        him discreetly on results of our intervention with Israelis with view to

                            >Nasser</persName>'s acceptance. We have been reluctant to get out in

                        critical juncture every effort must now be made to move parties toward some

                                <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> must come up with some

                        <item>King said his April 6-7 meetings with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                                >Nasser</persName> had been longest and most arduous he had ever had
                            with any leader. Jordanians had expected some difficulties in these
                            discussions but were stunned by <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                                >Nasser</persName>'s opening position which was totally negative to
                            concept of any peaceful solution. As far as Jordanians could see this
                            position was shared by all of <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                                >Nasser</persName>'s advisers. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                                >Nasser</persName> had begun by saying flatly that <persName
                                corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> Mission could not succeed, that
                            only military solution was feasible and that <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                                >UAR</gloss> military was therefore preparing for that solution.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> repeatedly said
                            Egyptian people would not stand for the humiliation of dealing with
                            Israelis through <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> in terms
                            of latter's present proposal. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                                >Nasser</persName> in fact considered <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                                >Jarring</persName>'s present formula as “an American trick.” He
                            indicated to the King a greater mistrust of US policy than ever and
                            stressed he is unwilling to resume diplomatic relations with the US.
                            According to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> he had just
                            turned down opportunity to restore relations and would continue to do

                        <item>King probed <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> for

                            take Israel on militarily, if <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                                >Nasser</persName> seriously meant that the military alternative was
                            the only one available to the Arabs. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                                >Nasser</persName> said he would be ready “before eighteen months
                            had lapsed.” King then countered with question how <gloss
                                target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> proposed to help Jordan militarily
                            since Israeli attacks on Jordan are occurring right now. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> replied unfortunately he was in
                            no position to give any help. Jordanians thereupon reminded Nasser he
                            had told them he felt personally responsible for loss of West Bank and
                            was prepared to do anything possible to help King recover his lost
                            territory. King pressed this point home with comment “Now you say no
                            political solution and yet you cannot help us militarily.” King said he
                            pointed out to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> that
                            whether <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> liked it or not Jordan did
                            not intend to continue to bear alone the brunt of Israeli military
                            attacks and would call for assistance other Arab states, specifically
                                <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. Thus, King continued, <gloss
                                target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> would become involved militarily
                            against Israel but once again in circumstances where Israelis would be

                            passed over the “to devise arrangements” phrase without hesitation. This
                            was point on which <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> had expected most
                            trouble. King said he had reserved as his fallback position insertion of
                            phraseology “readiness to implement” but found this was unnecessary.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> balked only at the

                            formula and stated that call for meetings in way <persName

                        <item>Jordanians' first thought was that they must then begin all over again
                            with their argumentation. They pointed out that the meeting with

                            was whole object of exercise. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                                >Nasser</persName> countered with statement if he accepted <persName
                                corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>'s “I have invited the two govts
                            to meet with me for conferences,” there would be a “revolution in Egypt

                            Cyprus as meeting place was out of the question. Jordanians then
                            suggested possibility of New York as meeting place. <persName

                                <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> indicated for example

                        <item>After reviewing the foregoing, King <persName>Hussein</persName> said
                            “This really is our last chance. You must persuade the Israelis to keep

                                >Jarring</persName> proposes in place of the present invitation to
                            the govts.” The King kept saying that “there will be talks and they can
                            be broadened later if we can only get the meetings started.” He also
                            said that although <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> and he
                            remain adamant against proceeding to a formal peace treaty, they had
                            discussed various formulas through which permanent and secure guarantees
                            of a peaceful settlement could be established. The King recognized the
                            problem of proposing changes in the present proposal. For that reason,
                            Rifai and Riad would not propose any specific language to <persName
                                corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> but would explain the problem
                            and try to stimulate him to come up with language of his own that would
                            solve the problem for the Arabs and at the same time be acceptable to
                            Israel as <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>'s own

                    <p>We have noted press and posts' reporting that the <gloss target="#t_GOI1"
                            >GOI</gloss> is under increasing pressure to authorize and facilitate
                        the establishment of civilian settlements in the occupied areas. Existing
                        settlements in the Golan Heights, Sinai, and at Etzion were justified by the
                            <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> as para-military encampments serving
                        security purposes. Recent reports (Tel Aviv A-716) indicate that these
                        settlements are taking on aspects of permanent, civilian, kibbutz-like
                        operations and some are, in fact, civilian kibbutzim <pb n="269"

                        Knesset February 26 he had approved. While there was no suggestion in his

                        groups filed applications with the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> and
                        it seems probable they are non-Nahal.</p>
                    <p>Although we have expressed our views to the Foreign Ministry and are

                        settlements in the occupied areas, we believe it would be timely and useful
                        for the Embassy to restate in strongest terms the US position on this

                    <p>You should refer to Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_EL1"
                            >Eshkol</persName>'s Knesset statement and our awareness of internal
                        Israeli pressures for settling civilians in occupied areas. The <gloss
                            target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> is aware of our continuing concern that
                        nothing be done in the occupied areas which might prejudice the search for a
                        peace settlement. By setting up civilian or quasi-civilian outposts in the
                        occupied areas the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> adds serious
                        complications to the eventual task of drawing up a peace settlement.
                        Further, the transfer of civilians to occupied areas, whether or not in
                        settlements which are under military control, is contrary to Article 49 of
                        the Geneva Convention,<note n="3" xml:id="d137fn3">Reference is to the

                        “The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian

                        in the occupied areas creates the strong appearance that Israel, contrary to

                                the Jordanian Government. The telegram indicated that the weight of
                                opinion within the Foreign Ministry inclined toward doing whatever
                                was necessary to keep <persName>Hussein</persName> on his throne as
                                the best hope of containing the terrorists, but others in the
                                Israeli Government advocated the overthrow of

                            prospects for peace further in the background. We are further concerned

                        <item>You should also emphasize that preservation of Jordanian regime is a
                            major US interest. We believe he still represents the best prospect for
                            a peaceful solution to the Arab-Israeli problem. In addition,

                            unfortunate repercussions for our interests throughout the area. We
                            trust that the Government of Israel will realize that the relationship
                            existing between our two countries justifies our expectation that Israel
                            will respect our interests even when Israel may not think them identical

                                fedayeen activities made it imperative that the settlement be

                                prepared to be flexible on the issue of Jerusalem, but could not
                                contemplate divided control of the city. (National Archives and

                                uncharacteristic for <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> to
                                admit that terrorism is having an unsettling effect in Israel, he is
                                still speaking from a position of strength since the alternative he
                                poses is further use of force.</item>

                            <item>The situation may not be so neat as that described above, and this
                                may be just one of several simultaneous attempts to explore a new
                                tack. We know they are considering such things as seizing part of
                                the East Bank, working directly against <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                                    >Nasser</persName> and <persName>Hussein</persName>, an $80
                                million fence on the Jordan, dealing directly with the Palestinians,
                                and a wide variety of military answers to terrorism, three of which
                                have been tried in the past month. It would not be surprising if
                                they were to make diplomatic use of these to try to precipitate
                                negotiations. They'd have nothing to lose, except that an ultimatum
                                of this sort may do more harm than good if poorly presented.</item>

                            <item>Or they may be afraid of us and this may be their way of pressing

                                are beginning to talk about “partial solutions” and “last chance for

                                “pro-Israeli” policy is slowly coming to life. Except for the
                                insight it provides if other evidence fills out the picture, there's
                                no immediate operational aspect to this message.</item>

                    <p>3252. Israeli independence day parade. Ref: Amman's 4270.<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d140fn2">Telegram 4270 from Amman, April 9, reported Jordanian
                            Government concerns that a proposed Israeli independence day parade
                            scheduled for May 2 through Jerusalem would lead to serious
                            repercussions in the Arab world if it went as planned through east
                            Jerusalem. The Embassy suggested that an effort be made to persuade the
                            Israelis to cancel or reroute the parade. To that end the Embassy
                            proposed that <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Secretary-General U
                            Thant be encouraged to issue a statement deploring the proposed parade
                            as likely to increase tensions in the area and complicate the efforts
                            being made to promote peace. The Embassy further suggested that the
                            Department issue a statement expressing a similar position.

                            independence day parade will very likely arouse negative reactions among
                            Arabs, I question whether the proposals set forth in <gloss

                            public critical position is very likely, I believe, to contribute only
                            to blow the whole matter up still further without positive return for us
                            or anyone else. The fact is of course, as ConGen Jerusalem has been
                            reporting for weeks, that Israeli plans and preparations are very far
                            advanced indeed, and that any intervention on our part would stand no
                            chance of effecting a major change in the spectacle.<note n="3"

                                and unwise. (Ibid.)</note> I urge that we make no public statements
                            on the parade and that if there are queries we limit ourselves to a
                            reiteration of our position on Jerusalem. I wonder in any case on what
                            grounds we could object to a military parade being held in occupied

                    <p>As you suggested, I broached with Eppie the question of how the President
                        might make a major effort for a Middle East settlement, explaining that this
                        was a purely personal and private conversation. I started with the notion
                        that some Israeli indication that a decent settlement is at the end of the
                        track is necessary to get negotiations going. We talked about the validity
                        of this premise and about how far the Israeli Government might go in sending
                        such a signal.</p>
                    <p>Our conversation was most revealing. I believe the answer, in short, is that
                        the Israelis are waiting till <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
                        falls and aren't anxious for any US initiative that hurries them toward
                        peace before that happens. Eppie musters all sorts of reasons—some sensible,
                        some marginal—but this is what I think it boils down to.</p>
                    <p>To me, this means that we have to make our own judgment and then set out with
                        all our energies to change the Israelis' minds (probably via an emissary).
                        To do this, we have to have a convincing answer to their arguments that (a)
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> can't or doesn't want to
                        negotiate peace; (b) they can't negotiate a settlement with a schizophrenic;
                        (c) <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> must go before other Arab
                        governments can be free to pursue their own interests in a settlement.</p>
                    <p>The choice before us is between (a) letting forces play out as they are with
                        an occasional tactical prod to keep <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                            >Jarring</persName> in motion and (b) playing for a substantial shift in
                        Israel's tactical position on the assumption that such a shift would get
                        serious negotiations started. So far, while everyone is uneasy about our
                        present course, no one has made the hard final judgment that would shift our
                        approach to leaning hard on the Israelis. We came close last week but were
                        diverted by the seeming break on the <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                            >Jarring</persName> front. I will be doing a separate memo to you and
                        Luke on this. For the moment, here's how my conversation with Eppie
                        went:</p>
                    <p>Eppie doubts—“with real regret”—that any kind of Presidential initiative or
                        Israeli compromise now would get negotiations started. <pb n="275"
                            xml:id="pg_275" facs="0303"/>He believes the Arabs will choose to wait
                        for President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s successor.
                        Any sign that we were urging compromise now would lead the Arabs to believe
                        that pressures are building up on the US to push Israel into a more flexible
                        position. Any sign of change in our position would encourage the Arabs to
                        believe that the President's successor would have to start at least from
                        that point and that greater compromise would be possible later. He pointed
                        out how unanimously the Arabs view the President's Vietnam proposal as a
                        sign of weakness and failure.</p>
                    <p>He further believes that the Arabs have all the signals they need from
                        Israel-that the main obstacle to negotiation is that the Arabs themselves
                        aren't ready to negotiate. In the way of signals, he cited particularly
                            <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName>'s 12 February interview with
                            <hi rend="italic">Haaretz</hi>. Having said that much, the Israelis
                        believe any more signs of compromise would be signs of weakness in Arab
                        eyes.</p>
                    <p>Eppie is playing with a new idea. He believes that feelings of Palestinian
                        separatism are growing stronger right under the surface on the West Bank.
                        Since he doubts that King <persName>Hussein</persName> is a free (from
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>) agent in negotiating a
                        settlement, he wonders whether Israel shouldn't start with a settlement
                        negotiated with the Palestinians and then let them determine their own
                        relationship with Jordan.</p>
                    <p>I suggested that, even to do this, Israel would have to make up its mind on
                        the shape of a final settlement. He asked what we had in mind. I told him we
                        had not drawn any lines on the map. I said that our main concern was that
                            <persName>Hussein</persName> get back a big enough portion of the West
                        Bank to call it a settlement and a significant role in Jerusalem. He hinted
                        that the Israelis are thinking about a substantial modification in the old
                        armistice line, pushing it eastward at least as far as the heights that run
                        down through Nablus past Jerusalem and Hebron (looks like 15-25% of West
                        Bank area). In Jerusalem he spoke of Jordanian administrative custodianship
                        of the mosque area and, at most, a corridor of access to the old city.</p>
                    <p>I said it sounded to me as if he advocates our standing back and letting
                        events take their course. He denied this. He feels that there is already
                        substantial Arab reason to believe that an eventual military solution would
                        be possible because we have stood back. He harked back again to the idea
                        that our greatest mistake in 1967 was to continue our suspension of arms
                        shipments while the Soviets were rearming the Arabs. The Arabs do not
                        believe we are firm in denying the area to the Soviets or in opposing the
                        radical Arabs. In his view, we have never even made it clear that the Sixth
                        Fleet will remain in the Mediterranean as long as it is needed. This
                        American wishy-washy-ness is, in his eyes, the greatest encouragement the
                        Arabs could find to believe that a military solution will become possible
                        someday. It's the old line of making Israel so unbeatable that the Arabs
                        will be forced to their knees.</p>

                        anything I have heard, the limits of trying to deal with the Israelis on the
                        basis of friendship. They deeply distrust our “softness” in dealing with the
                        Arabs. They will cultivate closeness with us as long as it suits their
                        purposes. They will not open up to us on basic strategy because they
                        disagree with us fundamentally over the question of whose side time helps.
                        If we disagree, we will have to make up our own minds and take them on.

                        to think this over, but I thought you'd be interested in his initial
                        reaction because it's so revealing.</p>

                            had not long before returned from Cairo and they had been discussing his
                            talks with <persName corresp="#p_RM1">Mahmoud Riad</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>.</item>

                        <item>The King with interjections from Abd al-Moneim explained a new snag
                            that had developed in the <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>
                            exercise as a result of the talks in Cairo on the 8th. As a result of
                            the talks Abd al-Moneim had with Riad and <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                                >Jarring</persName>, Jordan was now requesting the <gloss
                                target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> to state to the <gloss target="#t_GOI1"
                                >GOI</gloss> in writing that it is the <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                >USG</gloss> understanding that Israel, in saying that it accepts
                            the Nov 22, 1967 and <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>'s
                            March 10 proposal, means that it also accepts the implementation of the
                            resolution. If this could be done, then Jordanian and Egyptian
                            representatives would be in New York in a matter of few days ready to
                            talk under Jarring's auspices. After the talks started, Jordan would be
                            ready “to move very far, very fast” regardless of what the <gloss
                                target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> might do. But Jordan had to have the
                                <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> with it in order to get started
                            in talks. With the requested written assurance from the US, Jordan could
                            get the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> to talks in New York. The US
                            statement would be considered as an assurance, not as a commitment, the
                            King said.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>I responded that we had already been assured <persName
                                corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> had been informed officially by
                            Israel that it accepted his March 10 proposal. Why should anything else
                            be needed and why, in particular, should it be required of us? I did not
                            see how <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>'s proposal could
                            be modified without raising further questions and suspicions in
                            everyone's mind. To us <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>'s
                            proposal, like the Nov 22 resolution, meant what it said, nothing more
                            and nothing less. Israel had provided us with the wording of its written
                            telegram to <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> reiterating
                            acceptance of his proposal.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>Abd al-Moneim then explained the genesis of the Jordanian request as
                            follows: After a lot of jockeying around on the 8th about what would be
                            said to <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> and whether Jordan
                            and the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> would meet him separately or
                            together, it was decided Riad would see him first alone. Riad was to say
                            that Jordan had accepted his March 10 proposal <pb n="278"
                                xml:id="pg_278" facs="0306"/>and was ready to meet with him.
                                <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> had responded to Riad
                            and later to Rifai “That's fine, but Israel has not accepted the
                            implementation of the resolution.”</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>I expressed incredulity that <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                                >Jarring</persName> had said this. In the course of further
                            discussion, however, it came out that both Riad and Rifai had been told
                            by <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> that he did not
                            consider that Israeli acceptance of his March 10 proposal or the Israeli
                            telegram meant that they will implement the resolution.</item>
                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>I of course went over all of the old ground making especially the
                            following points: (1) the resolution is not self-implementing (2) to
                            accept the resolution is to accept the idea of its fulfillment (3) the
                            resolution is a package (4) talks between the parties, but not
                            necessarily direct talks, are understood to be required (5) some kind of
                            secure and permanent arrangements, but not necessarily a formal peace
                            treaty, are foreseen in implementing the resolution (6) the only true
                            test of the intentions of the other side is to sit down and start trying
                            “to devise arrangements for the implementation.” I said it was <persName
                                corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>'s job to get acceptance of
                            different words if he and the parties felt that other words were
                            necessary. I personally thought a great deal of time had already been
                            wasted in debating the meaning of words about “acceptance.” If now we
                            told Israel we were assuming the Arabs and Israel had agreed to
                            implement the resolution, Israel would have every right to ask us what
                            the Arabs meant by moving away from <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                                >Jarring</persName>'s March 10 proposal. We had heard enough about
                            these forms of words to know each side seemed to find some special magic
                            in them. If the Jordanian-<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> idea is to
                            play legal or semantic tricks on Israel I saw no hope for a peaceful
                            settlement. I did not see in any case why my govt should have to speak
                            for Israel in this way. We very much wanted a peaceful settlement but we
                            could not lend ourselves to deceiving either side. If we said “Israel
                            agrees to implement the resolution” it would mean no more and no less
                            than what the <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> March 10
                            proposal says.</item>
                        <label>7.</label>
                        <item>We went over and over this ground. The King emphasized there was no
                            intention of misleading anyone. Jordan simply has to have the <gloss
                                target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> with it to begin talks. The requested
                            assurance (not a commitment, he stressed several times), from us would
                            enable Jordan to get the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> to New
                            York. From then on there would be clear sailing. There would be no need
                            for a report or statement or anything else from <persName
                                corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>.</item>
                        <label>8.</label>
                        <item>I pressed Abd al-Moneim on why <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                                >Jarring</persName>'s proposal was not sufficient. He reiterated
                            that <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> had said he cannot
                            guarantee that Israel will implement the resolution and that he,
                                <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>, does not believe they
                            will. <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> had said this to
                            Riad. When <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> said the same
                            thing to Rifai, the latter had said the U.S. Embassy assures us Israel
                            accepts your proposal and will proceed to agree on its implementation.
                                <pb n="279" xml:id="pg_279" facs="0307"/>
                            <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> had said in effect: “I
                            don't believe it. Get it from that Embassy in writing.” It was largely
                            for this reason that Jordan now needed a statement from the <gloss
                                target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> in writing-a statement it could show to

                                made clear we could not envisage a viable Jordan without return of
                                the West Bank. We believe there must be withdrawal of Israeli forces
                                to recognized and secure frontiers but not, necessarily, the old
                                armistice lines. We believe there could be adjustments of these
                                lines based on security and economic considerations but that there
                                must be mutuality in adjustments. As Ambassador <persName
                                    corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> noted, for example, “If
                                Jordan makes an adjustment along the Latrun salient there ought to
                                be some compensatory adjustment for it.” Jerusalem, we recognize, is
                                probably the most difficult issue involved in any settlement, but
                                even here we are prepared to be helpful. We are willing to use our
                                influence to see what arrangements can be worked out for an
                                appropriate Jordanian role in Jerusalem. End <gloss target="#t_FYI1"

                        central problem of security. In the radically altered situation arising from
                        the June war, Israel's security problems have two major aspects: (a) its
                        military capabilities compared to those of the Arabs; and (b) the political,
                        psychological, diplomatic, and administrative questions involved in dealing
                        with the occupied territories and with its Arab neighbors in circumstances

                        <item>Despite its smashing victory in the June 1967 war, Israel finds that
                            acceptance by its Arab neighbors continues to elude it. A formal peace
                            settlement is out of the question, and the present stalemate, with
                            Israel occupying large tracts of territory and controlling a million
                            Arabs, will probably continue for a long time.</item>
                        <label>B.</label>
                        <item>Arab terrorist activity is likely to increase, though Israel will be
                            able to keep it under control. Incidents along the cease-fire lines will
                            also continue. Israel will retaliate on occasion, and this could develop
                            into heavy fighting. In the longer run, continued Israeli occupation
                            will almost certainly lead to a new round of major hostilities.</item>
                        <label>C.</label>
                        <item>In this condition of uneasy truce, Israel will maintain a military
                            superiority over the Arabs, with a view to deterring them or, if war
                            comes, defeating them quickly enough to prevent serious damage to
                            itself. This means modern weapons. Israel probably sees France as a not
                            very reliable source of such arms, at least as long as de Gaulle is in
                            power, and will look increasingly to the US. But it will also try to
                            produce as much as possible of its own military equipment.</item>
                        <label>D.</label>
                        <item>Six years ago, Israel contracted with a French supplier for a
                            surface-to-surface missile with a range of 280 nautical miles. It could
                            be deployed in Israel in 1969, if de Gaulle permits it. If he refuses to
                            allow the French firm to deliver the missiles or to assist Israel in
                            manufacturing <pb n="282" xml:id="pg_282" facs="0310"/>them, the latter
                            could go ahead on its own, but it would probably take at least five
                            years to deploy a missile system.</item>

                            >FonMin</gloss> said key to problem was limitation of Israel
                        expansionism. He said Israel unwilling forego expansionism and US unwilling
                        confront Israel on this issue.</p>
                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> talked very plainly to
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>. <persName
                            corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> said he willing make “package deal”
                        with Israel including withdrawal, “agreed and secure boundaries,”
                        demilitarization, non-belligerency. Documents to be prepared in advance and
                        then go into effect simultaneously.</p>
                    <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> pointed up folly of linking
                        Suez Canal to refugee problem. McCloy said refugee problem can never be
                        “solved” to Arab satisfaction. Meanwhile one of Egypt's most precious assets
                        wasting away. <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> suggested
                        reopening of Canal with <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> assistance on
                        terms of free passage for everybody. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                            >Nasser</persName> seemed to acknowledge the wisdom of such a course but
                        indicated his internal situation would not permit it.</p>
                    <pb n="283" xml:id="pg_283" facs="0311"/>
                    <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> admitted he was the one
                        standing in way of resumption US-<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                        relations. He again indicated concern re public reaction to resumption so
                        long as US did not balance its policy by doing something for Arabs.</p>
                    <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> recalled proposed US arms
                        aid to Egypt in 1954 had foundered on his refusal accept US technicians. We
                        had been right and he wrong. After June war he has been begging for Soviet
                        technicians. He unable deny use his ports to Soviet fleet.</p>
                    <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> made sympathetic noises re
                            <persName>Hussein</persName> but said if latter negotiated directly with
                        Israel he wouldn't last very long.</p>
                    <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> said since President
                            <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> has announced he will not
                        be a candidate might be time for US do something show its lack of bias for
                        Israel. <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> said no US
                        administration would take action compel Israel withdraw without assurance
                        for Israel's security and without convincing simultaneous action on part
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                            >Nasser</persName> said this bitter pill but he accepted it.</p>
                    <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> got impression <persName
                            corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> less vigorous, more subdued. He
                        senses restrictions on his flexibility. Although worried, he is not
                        distraught.</p>
                    <p>10. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> spoke in considerable
                        admiration for President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> and
                        what <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> called “his statesmanship
                        action” re Vietnam. Nasser added he completely convinced President's action
                        not a maneuver.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>We have already arranged two or three regular supply flights of non-lethal
                        equipment down from Turkey. State and Defense are now arguing over whether
                        to arrange 10-15 special flights to carry a few of the <gloss
                            target="#t_AA1">AA</gloss> guns and other combat equipment to make a
                        psychological impact such as we tried for after the Israeli raid on Samua in
                        1966.</p>
                    <p>Luke is trying to push this to urgent decision. Therefore, we do not have a
                        solid proposal yet, and I would recommend giving him another day or two to
                        work one out with Defense. If he can, then we would probably want to tell
                        the President since it would dramatize our arms shipments to Jordan at a
                        time when military exchanges across the Jordan River continue. Until we have
                        a recommendation, however, you may not want to distract him from other more
                        important issues.</p>

                            follows: US could not authorize its representatives to attend parade in
                            Jerusalem. This is consistent with our well known views on status of
                            Jerusalem. As we have stated publicly and privately we believe future
                            status of Jerusalem must be worked out in consultation with all parties
                            having interest in special character of the city. Satisfactory solution
                            for Jerusalem must take into consideration religious, <pb n="286"

                            stake including those of Israel and Jordan. This objective can best be
                            achieved by dealing with future of Jerusalem as element in general
                            political settlement. We have strongly and consistently expressed
                            opposition to unilateral Israeli acts which appear to consolidate or
                            symbolize de facto annexation of Jerusalem. We consider Israeli decision
                            to route parade through the occupied, formerly Jordanian-held sector of
                            the city a particularly provocative act which will understandably deepen
                            Arab suspicions re true Israeli will to peace. We think Israelis will
                            find little understanding for their action internationally and in UN.

                            Israel. The interaction of events in the two countries is likely to lead
                            to increased border conflict and to threaten
                                <persName>Hussein</persName>'s control of Jordan.</item>

                            <persName>Hussein</persName> would like to restrain the fedayeen,
                            because they block his chances of an accommodation with Israel, bring
                            reprisals, weaken his position on the throne, and infect the army and
                            public with radical and subversive ideas. But he is finding restraint
                            increasingly difficult since the fedayeen are popular symbols of
                            defiance of Israel. The army is dissatisfied with the US arms supply
                            program, and popular resentment toward the US is growing, based on a
                            feeling that the US is partial to Israel. These circumstances may force
                                <persName>Hussein</persName> to get arms from the <gloss

                            implications of such a deal. If <persName>Hussein</persName> lost
                            control, his regime would almost certainly be replaced by one more
                            radical and aggressive, perhaps something on the Syrian pattern.</item>
                        <label>C.</label>
                        <item>Fedayeen activity is unlikely to drive the Israelis from the occupied
                            areas or endanger the existence of Israel itself. Nevertheless, Israel's
                            leaders and people are united in their determination to halt Arab
                            terrorism. They are beginning to question their long-established policy
                                <pb n="288" xml:id="pg_288" facs="0316"/>of reprisals, and are
                            likely to try counterterrorism and hot pursuit as alternatives. They
                            might mount a major military invasion of the East Bank, but we think
                            they will decide that the disadvantages would outweigh the gains. In the
                            end, they are likely to try to seal off much of the present Jordanian
                            border, though such a defensive posture runs against Israeli military
                            tradition and instinct. Whatever their chosen tactic, they will be very
                            tough in dealing with Arab terrorism and are unlikely to be deterred by
                            the prospect that their efforts might topple

                        <item>Arab terrorists—“fedayeen”—have become a critical factor in the
                            internal affairs of Israel and Jordan, and in the relations of these
                            states with one another. For a time after the June war, there was little
                            fedayeen activity. Since the fall of 1967, however, such operations in
                            Israel and in the Israeli-occupied West Bank have been of sizable
                                proportions.<note n="3" xml:id="d148fn3">In mid-March 1968, the
                                Israeli Defense Minister said that 168 Israelis and 72 Arab citizens
                                had been killed or wounded by the fedayeen since the war, in
                                contrast with 58 killed or wounded in the preceding year. [Footnote
                                in the source text.]</note> As of mid-March, the Israelis claimed to
                            have killed over 90 terrorists and to have 1,500 under detention. Some
                            of these figures represent unorganized resistance activity in the Gaza
                            Strip and in the West Bank, and many of those detained are probably
                            suspects rather than proved fedayeen, but overall figures reflect a
                            rising level of terrorist activity.</item>

                        <item>At least 20 organizations have the purpose of using terrorism against
                            Israel. Most of them were formed before the June 1967 war and had as
                            their objective the liberation of Palestine from Israeli domination.
                            Since the June war, some of these organizations have represented
                            themselves as movements of resistance against Israeli occupation of Arab
                            territory. However, the line between these two goals is blurred, and
                            fedayeen raids are carried out against Israel proper as well as against
                            Israel-occupied Arab areas. The basic goal of the fedayeen probably is
                            to undermine the state of Israel itself. The bulk of this activity is
                            carried out by Fatah, which pre-dates the June war, and by the Popular
                            Front for the Liberation of Palestine, which was formed after it. The
                            other major group, the Palestine Liberation Organization (<gloss

                            does not appear to have engaged in raids against Israel.</item>

                            Vietnam, we do not believe that any non-Arab force controls any of the
                            fedayeen. Heavy financial support for liberation activities comes from
                            well-to-do Palestinians and other Arabs in the oil-rich states, and
                            demands appear to be increasingly levied on Jordanians. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> has now come out publicly in
                            support of the fedayeen. Once trained, the fedayeen cross into Jordan,
                            where they get help and sympathy from the Iraqi forces in Jordan and
                            from the large numbers of their fellow Palestinians there. Fedayeen
                            usually operate in teams of 4 to 11 men. Their missions include crossing
                            into Israel or Israeli-occupied territory to plant mines, ambush Israeli
                            personnel, conduct sabotage, and collect intelligence. The fedayeen have
                            a mixed collection of small arms, grenades, and mines; according to
                            Israeli reports, they have now acquired 120 mm mortars.</item>

                        <item>While there were relatively few fedayeen before June 1967, there are
                            now probably some 2,000 in Jordan alone. Many are of a new breed. They
                            are younger, better educated Palestinians with a sense of mission. They
                            are likely to pursue their goals with zeal and increasing skill, though
                            they are still relatively inexperienced. Fedayeen activity is unlikely
                            to drive the Israelis from the occupied areas or endanger the existence
                            of Israel itself.</item>
                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>Harsh repressive measures by Israeli occupation forces have kept the
                            West Bank Arabs from offering much assistance to the fedayeen. The
                            Israelis have apparently penetrated many of the fedayeen organizations,
                            and have been able to kill or capture a substantial number of
                            infiltrators in the act of crossing into Israeli-held territory. But
                            these countermeasures have not stifled the fedayeen. Indeed, each
                            successful incident will probably further boost their determination to
                            continue and enlarge their activities. Their methods, however, will
                            probably remain much the same; they will try to take Israeli lives and
                            inflict damage on property, will have some successes, and will remain
                            objects of very serious concern to Israel.</item>
                        <label>7.</label>
                        <item>The Israelis have also launched severe reprisal raids designed to make
                            the Jordanians withhold support from the fedayeen. For example, on 15
                            February, the Israelis shelled and bombed a refugee camp which they said
                            was harboring fedayeen. On 21 March, several thousand Israeli troops
                            crossed the Jordan River, seized the town of Karamah, a terrorist base,
                            killed and captured a number of alleged fedayeen, <pb n="290"
                                xml:id="pg_290" facs="0318"/>and killed at least 60 Jordanian
                            soldiers as well. These reprisals in particular have, contrary to
                            Israeli expectations, caused an upsurge of popular support for the
                            fedayeen, who have achieved a new respectability as Arab
                            patriots.</item>

                        <item>King <persName>Hussein</persName> has been in a difficult situation
                            since the June war. At that time he had earned almost universal approval
                            at home by joining with the other Arabs in fighting Israel, but this did
                            not entirely offset the shock of defeat and the great loss of territory.
                            As <persName>Hussein</persName> has tenaciously held on to his
                            connection with the US, which most Arabs believe strongly supports
                            Israel, and as his diplomatic efforts to regain lost territory have not
                            succeeded, frustration has become more open and pronounced in
                            Jordan.</item>
                        <label>9.</label>
                        <item>This situation makes it extremely difficult for King
                                <persName>Hussein</persName> to arrive at an acceptable policy
                            towards the fedayeen. He has endeavored to restrain their activities,
                            for he recognizes that they result in Israeli reprisals which he can
                            neither prevent nor protect against. These reprisals damage his country
                            and his people; they also increase resentment against his regime by the
                            Jordanian people and army. <persName>Hussein</persName> also believes
                            that continued terrorism is destroying the chances of an accommodation
                            with the Israelis which would return most of the West Bank to him.
                            Moreover, the fedayeen owe allegiance to no government and constitute a
                            subversive element which could provide a focus of antiregime sentiment.
                            While the upper echelons of the Jordanian Government share
                                <persName>Hussein</persName>'s views, the bulk of the Jordanian
                            people feel considerable sympathy for the anti-Israeli actions of the
                            fedayeen. By and large, the Jordanian Army is not hostile to the
                            infiltrators; some army units have provided covering fire for fedayeen
                            crossing the Jordan River. They have probably, despite orders to the
                            contrary, given them material support. Further, the Jordanian Army has
                            not inhibited the open assistance given the fedayeen by Iraqi troops in
                            Jordan.</item>

                        <item>Thanks to the rising popularity of the fedayeen, and to general anger
                            in Jordan at Israeli reprisals, King <persName>Hussein</persName> now
                            finds it increasingly difficult to restrict the anti-Israeli actions of
                            the fedayeen who live in his territory. He is seeking accommodation with
                            their leaders so as to curb criminal or antiregime activity which these
                            groups might undertake. He probably is also trying to exploit
                            differences among rival fedayeen groups and among the Arab regimes and
                            factions that support them. There is little likelihood that this
                            situation will change, and the fedayeen will probably operate from
                            Jordan into Israel without fear of effective official opposition. As for
                                <persName>Hussein</persName>, either permitting them to operate
                            freely or trying to assert some degree of control over them is likely to
                            adversely affect his position over a period of time.</item>

                        <item>In the past, <persName>Hussein</persName>'s principal support has been
                            the army, but the sympathy of some of its elements with terrorist
                            activities may make it receptive to the general hostility of the
                            fedayeen to the monarchy. This process is likely to be hastened by
                            rising dissatisfaction with what the officer corps considers an
                            unacceptably slow pace of arms resupply by the US. Military leaders have
                            noted <persName>Hussein</persName>'s lengthy, frustrating negotiations
                            with the US—negotiations which have so far led to an agreement for arms
                            supplies but have not yet resulted in the arrival of any weapons. They
                            contrast this with the speedy Soviet resupply of the <gloss

                            receiving Soviet weapons, military officers are likely to press
                                <persName>Hussein</persName> to do so. To help fend off this
                            pressure, he is seeking to get Western arms from Iraq and Saudi Arabia,
                            and perhaps from Pakistan and Iran. <persName>Hussein</persName> has
                            consistently refused to accept Soviet arms but would almost certainly
                            accede if he felt it necessary to enable him to remain in power. A
                            Soviet arms deal would be popular with the military and the public at
                            large. <persName>Hussein</persName> might also consider that arms from

                                >USSR</gloss> would afford new protection from Israeli reprisal
                            attacks. He might reason that Syria's close relations with the <gloss

                            Israel has left Syria alone.</item>

                            with these countries, he might attempt to secure only specific
                            categories of arms—e.g., tanks or artillery—from Moscow.
                                <persName>Hussein</persName> would almost certainly take the line
                            that he had turned to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> only as
                            a last resort. His basic international policies would continue to take

                            with Israel. While he might benefit from increased domestic popularity,
                            he would seek to rule through the same group of generally monarchist
                            conservatives which has staffed Jordan's Government for years.</item>

                            from fellow Arabs and from the West—are substantial, and the initiatives
                            open to him are not promising. Much will depend on the interaction of
                            forces in the area; a continued high level of fedayeen activity
                            accompanied by Israeli military countermeasures would seriously weaken

                        <item>Israel has had a long-standing policy of reprisal in force for
                            terrorist incidents involving loss of Israeli lives. But this policy has
                            come under domestic criticism as a result of the Karamah raid.
                            Preparations for this raid were not concealed; most of the fedayeen had
                            left Karamah before the Israelis arrived and have since returned.
                            Although raids are planned so as to limit the loss of Israeli troops, 25
                            Israelis were killed and over 70 wounded in the Karamah operation. This
                            was due in part to the fact that the Jordanian Army, much to the
                            Israelis' surprise, chose to fight rather than stand by. Opponents of
                            the reprisal policy point out that future raids like that on Karamah are
                            likely to cause heavy Israeli casualties and will probably fail to
                            achieve their purpose. Fedayeen operations since Karamah have taken
                            several Israeli lives. Jerusalem's Mayor Kollek has said publicly that
                            reprisals do not crush the spirits of the Arabs but, on the contrary,
                            lead to increased support for terrorism and to more recruits for the
                            fedayeen organizations. His position apparently has some support in the
                            Israeli Cabinet.</item>

                        <item>Despite this opposition, the commitment to reprisal is deeply
                            ingrained, especially in the Israeli military establishment. Though
                            Israeli military leaders are probably aware that reprisals weaken

                            actions which risk his replacement by a new, more hostile regime in
                            Jordan. Where the Israelis have previously seen advantages in Hussein's

                            even see benefits in his departure. Were he to disappear, the Israelis
                            could tell the US that the situation in the Near East had so evolved
                            that Israel was its only friend, could hope for greater US military
                            supplies, and could argue that returning the West Bank to an
                            anti-Western regime would not be in the interest of either the US or
                            Israel.</item>

                        <item>The Israelis are adopting new antiterrorist measures to supplement or
                            replace large-scale reprisal. They have recently engaged in hot pursuit
                            with small forces into Jordanian territory. Other measures <pb n="293"
                                xml:id="pg_293" facs="0321"/>being considered include the dispatch
                            of Israeli terrorists into Arab territory, with the object of inflicting
                            greater property damage and loss of life than the fedayeen cause in
                            Israel. Such activity will probably appear in the next few months. Such
                            counterterrorism would probably have no more satisfactory results in
                            stopping terrorism than the policy of massive reprisal has had. Such
                            raids would probably lead to further loss of Israeli lives and would not
                            prevent the fedayeen from operating in Israel. But the advantage, Israel
                            may believe, would be that it would make Israel a less conspicuous
                            target for international condemnation.</item>
                        <label>19.</label>
                        <item>If the Israelis are not able to contain terrorism by such means as
                            increased police action, reprisals, and counterterrorism, they would
                            then be forced to choose other measures, none particularly palatable.
                            One course would be to mount a major military assault against the East
                            Bank, overrunning the populated area of Jordan. But such a move would
                            risk a renewal of broader Arab-Israeli hostilities, and could bring on a
                            new international crisis. World reaction would be extremely hostile.
                            Though generally confident of US support—or of at least tacit
                            acquiescence for the moves it makes—Israel might feel that an all-out
                            invasion of Jordan would dangerously threaten American tolerance of
                            Israeli militancy. Further, the Israelis probably recognize the great
                            disadvantages of occupying the East Bank, with its million and a half
                            Arabs and its unviable economy now being kept afloat by large subsidies
                            from rich Arab countries. And once Israel withdrew from Jordan, the
                            fedayeen would probably soon reemerge. On balance, we believe the
                            chances are against a massive Israeli invasion of Jordan.</item>
                        <label>20.</label>
                        <item>An alternative, which has received some attention in Israel, would be
                            to seal off at least the most troublesome stretches of the present
                            Jordanian cease-fire and armistice lines with such devices as barbed
                            wire, sensors, electrified fences, and land mines. The French used such
                            a barrier, on the whole successfully, to seal Algeria's Tunisian and
                            Moroccan frontiers during the rebellion. Israel, with a shorter and more
                            easily patrolled frontier with Jordan, could probably make such a
                            barrier work fairly effectively. Some of these devices have already been
                            installed in selected border areas. Though a major defensive barrier
                            would not be able to stop the fedayeen completely, it would probably
                            reduce their activities—and cut Israeli casualties—sharply. The million
                            and a half Arabs now in Israel and Israeli-occupied territory have not
                            helped the fedayeen much. If virtually cut off from contact with and
                            supplies from their Arab brethren, they probably could not engage in
                            significant, organized terrorist activity.</item>
                        <label>21.</label>
                        <item>There almost certainly are strong voices raised against such a
                            proposition in Israel. A heavily fortified 200-mile frontier barrier
                            would be expensive to build; it would have to be patrolled by large
                            numbers <pb n="294" xml:id="pg_294" facs="0322"/>of Israeli soldiers. It
                            would run counter to the established Israeli military doctrine that a
                            defensive posture is anathema. And it would ease domestic pressure on
                                <persName>Hussein</persName>, whose efforts to restrain the fedayeen
                            would then be assumed by the Israelis themselves.</item>
                        <label>22.</label>
                        <item>Nonetheless, the Israelis will, over a period of time, probably be
                            forced to opt for more effective defensive measures to seal off Israel
                            and Israeli-occupied territory from Jordanian-based fedayeen operations.
                            Israel's traditional reluctance to adopt a posture of static defense
                            stemmed in large part from the feeling that this would permanently
                            commit it to unsatisfactory frontiers; it would feel little inhibition
                            on that score about the present shorter and more defensible cease-fire
                            line. At the same time, Israel would be prepared to use various forms of
                            retaliation against Jordan—including very severe ones—if defensive
                            measures are insufficient to prevent Israeli casualties.</item>

                            Bringing about Stability in the Middle East</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">John J. McCloy</persName> paid a courtesy call
                        April 13 on President <persName corresp="#p_HC1">Helou</persName>. The
                        President availed himself of the occasion to summarize his present thinking
                        on how the apparent impasse in Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                            >Jarring</persName>'s efforts to find a peaceful solution to the Middle
                        East crisis might be broken. Emphasizing that he was speaking as a
                        “Westernized Arab” the President stressed the need to understand basic Arab
                        psychology. A fundamental prerequisite to achieving progress toward “peace”
                        is a realization that no Arab leader could sign any agreement which would,
                        in effect, give up what the Arabs hold to be their right to reclaim
                        Palestine. As a direct consequence of this basic factor of life, real
                        “peace” in the juridical sense of the word is not attainable; there can be
                        no Versailles-type peace treaty. Therefore, it is unproductive to talk in
                        such <pb n="295" xml:id="pg_295" facs="0323"/>terms and, since the Israelis
                        understand this aspect of Arab thinking, their persistent demands for direct
                        negotiations leading to the signing of a peace treaty are considered only a
                        pretext to retain the newly occupied territories.</p>
                    <p>Though true peace cannot be obtained, there may be a peaceful way out of the
                        current impasse. The November 22 Security Council Resolution contains the
                        elements necessary to reach a modus vivendi. Full implementation of all of
                        the practical measures contained in the resolution would bring about an
                        effective condition of “stability.” Neither direct negotiations nor the
                        signing of a peace treaty figure in the resolution and they are not
                        essential to attaining this “effective stability.” In the President's view a
                        prolonged period of such “effective peace” or “stability” would present
                        opportunities to solve the many issues inextricably tied to a Middle East
                        settlement. No progress could be made until the two sides were separated by
                        demilitarized zones and a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> presence which
                        could end the military confrontation and gradually reduce the emotions and
                        hatreds which governed the actions of both sides.</p>
                    <p>Since the key to a peaceful solution is implementation of the provisions of
                        the November resolution, it is incumbent upon the US to use its influence to
                        obtain Israeli acceptance. The President acknowledged the limited
                        effectiveness of US efforts to pressure Israel into taking specific actions
                        and commented that <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> Ambassador Ghaleb had
                        himself acknowledged this fact in a recent conversation with the President.
                        As far as withdrawal is concerned, President <persName corresp="#p_HC1"
                            >Helou</persName> said that the Arabs accept the fact that some
                        modification of the pre-June war boundaries is essential in the interest of
                        security and stability. Furthermore, the President believes establishment of
                        a demilitarized zone along the new Arab frontiers with Israel, in which
                        international forces would be stationed, would contribute to maintaining the
                        “effective stability” he believes attainable.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> outlined current US public
                        opinion on the Arab-Israel problem for the President. He stressed that many
                        Americans consider justified Israel's determination not to withdraw from the
                        territories occupied during the June war until it obtains firm guarantees of
                        peace and security. In the aftermath of the 1956 Suez campaign, the US used
                        its influence to pressure Israel into withdrawing from the Sinai and Gaza.
                        In the absence of effective international guarantees, ten years later war
                        again broke out between the Arabs and the Israelis. This time more is
                        required than perfunctory verbal or paper guarantees before the US should
                        pressure Israel into making concessions.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> told President <persName
                            corresp="#p_HC1">Helou</persName> that, although he was not on an
                        official mission in the Middle East, he hoped he would be able to pass the
                        President's views on to appropriate policy-making officials of the US
                        Government.</p>

                        of the moderate Western-oriented Arab leader interpreting Arab thoughts and
                        feelings to a Western audience. He, of course, is indeed the “Arab friend of
                        the West” which he terms himself to be. His analysis of the current
                        situation and appeal for a “practical” solution in terms of a provisional
                        modus vivendi is almost word for word the story he related to David
                        Rockefeller in February. He is convinced continued efforts to seek the
                        impossible can only frustrate progress toward a practical solution.</p>

                                both of these judgments provided we plan only delivery at the rate
                                of about four aircraft per month as they come off the production
                                line. However, they haven't given up arguing that the situation
                                might be serious enough to require delivering 30 or 40 planes in
                                January 1970, or even before. We could meet that contingency by
                                diverting the planes from our own inventory, but Israeli technicians
                                and pilots would not be ready.</p>

                            are essentially the same, and the Israelis have surfaced no new evidence
                            that causes our intelligence community to alter its estimate
                            significantly.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>The reason the Israelis continue to press the gloomy picture despite our
                        general agreement on facts is that they naturally take account of all
                        possible enemy capabilities rather than relying on estimates of Arab and
                        Soviet intentions. We're not likely to be able to prove our estimates that
                        the threat will continue to be manageable. The problem in trying to resolve
                        this difference is that their more pessimistic estimate reflects not only
                        their understandable concern for the worst they might face but also an
                        effort to influence our policy.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> asked me some days
                        ago “at <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName>'s request” what the
                        state of our decision is. With your permission, I propose simply to give
                            <persName corresp="#p_EE1">Evron</persName> a low-key informal progress
                        report on our staff work. I would say that you are keeping the mater under
                        the active review you promised. That you have received the recommendations
                        you asked for from General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>,
                        from the Secretary of Defense and the Director of Central Intelligence and
                        that you have satisfied yourself that your option to begin delivering
                        aircraft in early 1970 remains open. If we give <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1"
                            >Rabin</persName> a formal answer, he'll have to report it, and
                            <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName> will probably put it in the
                        most pessimistic light.</p>
                    <p>We are groping for some way to link this decision to specific progress toward
                        a political settlement. I don't believe we can bargain 50 planes for Israeli
                        withdrawal. But we might find a time to use them in bargaining for a
                        marginal shift in Israel's tactical position that might <pb n="298"

                        get negotiations started. Therefore, I don't believe there is any reason to
                        rush your decision, but we will stay on top of it as you promised <persName

                                target="#t_UARG1">UARG</gloss>. He had in fact been instructed
                            inform us that statements made by various US representatives, plus lack
                            of any tangible gesture on our part in support of Arabs, or in
                            recognition their forward motion since last June, had persuaded Cairo
                            that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> was engaged in deliberate
                            campaign to support Israeli effort to dragoon Arabs to negotiating
                            table. Whatever formula we devised, however it was camouflaged,
                            Egyptians would not sit down with Israelis in New York or anywhere else
                            and we might as well forget about it. Given this fact, real question was
                            whether parties could move to substantive discussion without
                            face-to-face meetings. Egyptians thought it possible and it was for this
                            reason that Riad had made his three-point proposal to <persName
                                corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> on April 8. If assured that
                            Israel would implement the resolution, Egyptians were prepared to
                            discuss substance and modalities of implementation through <persName
                                corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>, but not directly with Israelis.
                            If communications were the problem, this was an argument for moving to
                            New York, where it would be possible to check quickly on what the
                            parties had said and meant. Arabs could be in one room and Israelis in
                            another, even in the same suite, and <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                                >Jarring</persName> could move back and forth to work out details of
                            agreement. This was not a negative position, this was a positive
                            proposal for progress towards peace. Egyptians still wanted a peaceful

                    <p>Israeli Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> on March 20
                        had asked Mr. <persName>Rostow</persName> “at Prime Minister <persName

                        decision on Phantoms as discussed at the Ranch. Mr.

                            >Evron</persName> informally. Not wishing to provoke a strong reaction
                        in Jerusalem, Mr. <persName>Rostow</persName> with the President's approval
                        passed the information informally in order to give <persName

                        yesterday to hear this report. Mr. <persName>Rostow</persName>, speaking
                        very precisely, told him the following: <list>

                            <item>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> had
                                determined that the President could decide as late as December 31,
                                1968, and still begin delivering Phantoms in January 1970 at the
                                production-line rate of about 4 per month.</item>

                                and his team, had determined that US training can be done beginning

                                electronics basics) in Israel.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>
                                <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> has reviewed the
                                    intelligence exchanges [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of
                                        text not declassified</hi>]. There's no major disagreement
                                    on numbers. We interpret these numbers differently with Israel
                                    taking the gloomier view. However, Mr. <persName
                                        corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> sees no new evidence that
                                    would change his estimates.</p>
                                <p>Mr. <persName>Rostow</persName> also said that we had carried out
                                    our intention, discussed at the Ranch, to approach the Soviets
                                    with the following results: <list>
                                        <item>—We've made two serious approaches.</item>
                                        <item>—The Soviets say they're willing to discuss arms
                                            limitation after Israeli withdrawal.</item>
                                        <item>—We have never assumed that a direct Soviet answer was
                                            the only possible response. We have always assumed that
                                            the only Soviet response might be a de facto slowdown of
                                            shipments. We are watching this closely.</item>

                                </p>

                    <pb n="301" xml:id="pg_301" facs="0329"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EE1">Evron</persName> in response said he knew his
                        government would be quite concerned. One of the things General <persName
                            corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> at the Ranch had said the US would
                        specially watch was France's decision on the Mirages. Not only have the
                        French still not delivered them, but they have signed a contract with Iraq.
                        Iraq, from this deal alone, will end up with more Mirages than Israel now
                        has in its inventory. <persName corresp="#p_EE1">Evron</persName> admitted
                        that Soviet shipments to the Arab countries at the moment seemed to have
                        leveled off and that absorptive capacity is a limiting factor. However, he
                        said, noting that he could not be exact, that Israel has information that
                        the training level of Egyptian pilots had increased to something like 50-100
                        a year.</p>
                    <p>In sum, <persName corresp="#p_EE1">Evron</persName> felt there were elements
                        in the situation which called for an earlier decision than waiting until the
                        end of 1968. He conceded that it is technically accurate to say that the
                        President's option will remain open until the end of 1968, but he noted that
                        there are both “psychological and political” elements in the situation which
                        make an earlier decision desirable. In fact, he felt that a public decision
                        was called for, although he did not press that. He then spelled out his
                        notion that the Arabs will only negotiate when they are thoroughly persuaded
                        Israel is so strong that no military solution is possible. In conclusion, he
                        said he could only tell us that the continued uncertainty would worry
                        Jerusalem and urge a prompt decision.</p>
                    <p>With that subject covered, Mr. <persName>Rostow</persName> turned to the
                        broader subject of a political settlement, emphasizing that he was speaking
                        entirely personally. He felt a tremendous sense of foreboding and saw the
                        area teetering between the breakup of Jordan and the prospect some day of a
                        bigger war. He felt that “what we and the Israelis owe to our grandchildren
                        transcends hardware.” He felt it is absolutely essential that the Israelis
                        give some encouragement to King <persName>Hussein</persName> to negotiate a
                        settlement. He realized that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
                        seems unwilling at the moment to go that route, but
                            <persName>Hussein</persName> is grasping for any straw that would permit
                        him to negotiate a bilateral settlement. Mr. <persName>Rostow</persName>
                        felt that what is necessary is for the Israelis to give
                            <persName>Hussein</persName> some glimpse of the kind of settlement they
                        might expect on the West Bank, but particularly in Jerusalem.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EE1">Evron</persName> agreed that
                            <persName>Hussein</persName> is desperately trying to persuade Nasser to
                        give him the blessing for making his own settlement.
                            <persName>Hussein</persName>—and here <persName corresp="#p_EE1"
                            >Evron</persName> cautioned the utmost sensitivity-is using the West
                        Bank notables to try to persuade <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                            >Nasser</persName> to give <persName>Hussein</persName> a free hand. He
                        did not disagree with Mr. <persName>Rostow</persName>'s line, although he
                        did indicate that there already is communication through the notables with
                            <persName>Hussein</persName>.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion, <persName corresp="#p_EE1">Evron</persName> reiterated his
                        argument that a decision on the Phantoms now would both increase <persName
                            corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName>'s maneuverability with his <pb

                            <persName>Hussein</persName> further evidence with which to convince
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> that the political
                        solution was the only one possible.</p>

                                >USUN</gloss>, April 26, reported on an Israeli appreciation of the
                            situation in the Middle East, as conveyed by Permanent Representative

                            intransigent and waiting for a more favorable opportunity to achieve a

                            flexible, and Tekoah indicated that Israel would continue to explore the
                            possibility that Jordan might adopt an independent policy. (Ibid., POL

                    </list>
                    <p>We are taking a fresh look at the present situation in the Middle East in
                        light of the continuing differences between the Arabs and Israelis which
                        have made it impossible for <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> to
                        get talks started and with a view to seeing whether we can recommend to you
                        additional steps to give effect to the policy objectives of your June 19,
                        1967 speech. However, we have a more immediate short-range problem in the
                        Security Council which begins Saturday to consider the problem of Jerusalem
                        at the request of Jordan. Israel is holding an Independence Day parade which
                        violates provisions of the Armistice Agreement<note n="2" xml:id="d154fn2"
                            >Reference is to the General Armistice Agreement between Israel and
                            Transjordan signed at Rhodes on April 3, 1949.</note> and <pb n="304"

                        resolutions by introducing military forces into Jerusalem beyond those
                        permitted in the Agreement.</p>
                    <p>The Jordanian objectives are threefold: (a) to get the Security Council to
                        call on Israel to cancel the Independence Day parade of May 2; (b) to
                        reinforce the Armistice Agreement framework, which is an anathema to the
                        Israelis; and (c) to mobilize Security Council opinion against Israeli
                        unilateral measures in Jerusalem which in the Jordanian view amounts to de
                        facto annexation prejudicial to any ultimate settlement. Jordan has
                        requested our support. (We persuaded <persName corresp="#p_EA1"
                            >Eban</persName> to say at the United Nations last summer that Israeli
                        administration of Jerusalem is not an annexation, but municipal
                        administration by the occupying power.)</p>
                    <p>There are basically two approaches we can take in the Security Council.</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>
                            <p>
                                <hi rend="italic">First</hi>, on the assumption we cannot develop
                                sufficient common ground between the United States and Jordanian
                                positions on Jerusalem, we could decide not to try to influence the
                                Jordanians. In these circumstances, they would develop a resolution
                                which would certainly go beyond what the United States could
                                support. We would abstain in the vote, as we have on the two past
                                General Assembly resolutions on Jerusalem, while restating in the
                                Council the basic principles of our policy in essentially the same
                                terms as in the past. Such a result would not disturb Israel too
                                much since it attaches more importance to the United States vote
                                than to the Security Council result. Israel would disregard such a
                                resolution. It would go ahead with the parade and refuse to alter
                                measures already taken in Jerusalem extending its control.</p>
                            <p>Such a United States abstention would be exploited by the Soviets
                                against our position in the area; it would further disillusion and
                                weaken King <persName>Hussein</persName>; it would be played by the
                                Arabs and his own people as another example that the King's
                                friendship with the United States is not paying off for him; it
                                would further aggravate the difficulties which have prevented
                                    <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> from getting a
                                dialogue started.</p>
                            <p>We believe, and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1"
                                    >Goldberg</persName> concurs, there is a second approach which
                                should at least be tried even though its chances of succeeding are
                                slim.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Second</hi>, we would have Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> meet with the Jordanians and
                            probably the Pakistanis to see whether agreement can be achieved or a
                            resolution based on the attached principles which are consistent with
                            our present policy on Jerusalem.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>We would have to vote “yes” on the resolution if it stayed within the limits
                        of these principles, and we would have to give the Jordanians this assurance
                        at the outset of the Security Council discussions.</p>
                    <pb n="305" xml:id="pg_305" facs="0333"/>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> wishes in the
                        first instance to make a major effort to convince the Jordanians to limit
                        the resolution to <hi rend="italic">principle 1: A Call on Israel to cancel
                            the parade because it would aggravate tension and make the <persName
                                corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> Mission more difficult</hi>.
                        This would be consistent with past policy.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> would also be
                        given discretion to support principles 2 through 6 in a Security Council
                        resolution if he thought it would be helpful. The reason we are being so
                        gingerly about principles 2 through 6 is not because they are inconsistent
                        with our policy but because an indication to the Jordanians of a willingness
                        on our part to discuss them could lead to touchy and intricate political and
                        legal issues being raised in the Security Council resolution. Israel is
                        particularly anxious to avoid references to the Armistice Agreement in a
                        resolution since their objective is to replace the unstable Armistice
                        Agreement framework with a durable and stable peace by means of a negotiated
                        settlement. We share this objective. We would leave it to Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>'s judgment as to whether
                        and when to inject principles 2 through 6 in the discussions. We agree with
                        him that we should not support a resolution that has the effect of
                        bulwarking an Armistice Agreement system that has proved unworkable in the
                        past.</p>
                    <p>If we succeed along these lines we would avoid being isolated, it would be
                        helpful to our position in the area, and it would help maintain an
                        atmosphere in Jordan in which <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>
                        could continue his efforts. Both <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName>
                        and <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> intend in the next ten
                        days to concentrate in particular on the possibilities of Israeli-Jordan
                        talks, since the recent hardening of the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                        position makes early progress in Cairo unlikely. As you know, Jordan and
                        Israel are close together on <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>'s
                        approach while the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> has thus far been
                        very negative.</p>
                    <p>You should be aware there will be Israeli grumbling with this second
                        approach. There will also be some domestic reaction in certain quarters, but
                        it should be manageable since the recommended course does not involve any
                        sharp change from past policy. We have long agreed to disagree with the
                        Israelis on Jerusalem. We could balance this somewhat by reaffirming
                        strongly the five principles you stated on June 19, 1967.</p>
                    <p>The fact is that the Israelis have acted very badly on this Jerusalem matter
                        and have put us in a position of near isolation in the United Nations which
                        in turn is having adverse repercussions on our overall position in the area.
                        Those favoring a settlement in Israel would be strengthened by our
                        position.</p>

                            of all the problems arising out of the June conflict.</p>
                        <p>4. A satisfactory solution for Jerusalem must take into consideration the
                            religious, economic, and political interests at stake, including those
                            of Israel and Jordan. Its future status must be worked out in
                            consultation with all parties having an interest in the special
                            character of the city.</p>
                        <p>5. Israel is obligated to observe the provisions of international law
                            governing the rights and obligations of an occupying power in the
                            newly-occupied sections of Jerusalem, as it is in the other occupied
                            territories.</p>
                        <p>6. Pending a settlement, Israel should refrain from actions in the
                            newly-occupied sections of Jerusalem which are prejudicial to the future
                            status of the city or which impede progress toward a settlement.</p>

                    <p>154625. 1. Please deliver following message to Foreign Minister <persName
                            corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> from the Secretary.</p>
                    <p>“Dear Mr. Minister:</p>
                    <p>We have in the past discussed the dangers to mankind of a further spread of
                        nuclear weapons. The current resumed session of the United Nations General
                        Assembly will have the opportunity in this respect to take a major step by
                        endorsing a treaty to prevent the further spread of nuclear weapons. It is
                        the strong feeling of my government that the General Assembly should endorse
                        the treaty and ask that it be opened immediately for signature by as many
                        countries as possible so that it may enter into force at the earliest
                        possible date.</p>
                    <p>To assure prompt and widespread support for the treaty, parallel action will
                        be necessary on the part of certain nations and groups of nations which have
                        an understandable desire to assure themselves that their neighbors will also
                        adhere to the treaty. The Middle East is clearly an area which stands
                        greatly to benefit from the enhanced security which this treaty will
                        provide. In this area, parallel action by Israel and the Arab states will be
                        required for such a benefit to be realized.</p>
                    <p>The Government of Israel, which, as the most technologically advanced state
                        in the Middle East, has made clear its intention not to be the first to
                        introduce nuclear weapons into the area, is therefore in a position to
                        assure that the treaty will effectively encompass the nations of the Middle
                        East. That is why I urge, Mr. Minister, that your government as early as
                        possible in the General Assembly make clear its readiness to join in
                        supporting the treaty at the resumed United Nations General Assembly
                        session. This, I trust, will shortly be followed by an announcement that
                        Israel is prepared to sign the treaty.</p>
                    <p>As you know, we are keenly aware of the many problems you face in assuring
                        Israel's security. We recognize your concern over the buildup of
                        conventional weapons in the states surrounding Israel. I can assure you
                        again, as President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> told
                        Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName> in January, that
                        we will press every opportunity to achieve satisfactory limitation of
                        shipments from the Soviet Union. I can also repeat what <pb n="308"
                            xml:id="pg_308" facs="0336"/>the President said in January about our
                        determination to keep Israel's needs under active and sympathetic
                        review.</p>
                    <p>In that context, I believe this treaty is crucial to the ultimate security of
                        Israel. While we will work to limit the conventional arms race or keep it in
                        appropriate balance, it is absolutely essential to prevent that race from
                        leaping into weaponry against which Israel cannot be defended. The
                        consequences of its use in your country would be catastrophic.</p>
                    <p>Because we do not expect any Arab nuclear capability in the foreseeable
                        future, Israel's objective must be to prevent, insofar as is possible by
                        political arrangements, the transfer of such weapons to its neighbors. While
                        the gains to Israel through adherence to the <gloss target="#t_NPT1"
                            >NPT</gloss> would be vital, the only cost to Israel would be
                        self-denial of the questionable deterrent of an unknown nuclear
                        capability.</p>
                    <p>However, I must also tell you that I consider this treaty to transcend even
                        these crucial national issues. Its potential contribution to the safety and
                        survival of all mankind—as well as to the survival of each nation large or
                        small—is so great as to compel its separate consideration. I am confident
                        that Israel will not ignore the worldwide significance of this act. I hope,
                        therefore, that the United States can count on your government's initiative
                        in supporting this treaty in the coming session of the United Nations
                        General Assembly.</p>
                    <p>Sincerely yours, <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Dean Rusk</persName>.”</p>

                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> has approved instructing
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BW1">Barbour</persName> to ask Prime
                        Minister <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName> for another visit by
                        US experts to the Israeli <pb n="309" xml:id="pg_309" facs="0337"/>nuclear
                        reactor at Dimona. Our last visit was in April 1967. <persName
                            corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName> has acquiesced in periodic visits
                        every 12-13 months, although he has never been enthusiastic.</p>
                    <p>The visit this year is more important than ever. Up through last spring, we
                        were reasonably confident that the Dimona reactor was being used only for
                        research and that the Israelis were making no attempt to produce
                        weapons-grade plutonium. The reactor used fuel elements from France which
                        had to be returned to France when used. Late last year, however, there were
                        indications that Israel was processing ore obtained without safeguards from
                        Argentina. This could be to make their own fuel elements so they wouldn't
                        have to depend either on France or on safeguarded material.</p>
                    <p>We have no evidence that Israel has facilities for separating significant
                        amounts of plutonium from irradiated fuel—the next step toward weapons
                        production. But our experts say that last winter's activity could portend a
                        decision to build such a plant. They estimate it would be only two years
                        from that decision to Israel's first weapons test. <persName
                            corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName>'s response to our request could be an
                        important clue to his intentions (though his political difficulties with the
                        visit will also play a role).</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> has already sent the
                        message we showed you urging Israel to support the <gloss target="#t_NPT1"

                        its mind till toward the end of the year. This visit to Dimona will provide
                        another avenue for reminding them that we're serious about opposing their
                        going nuclear. Since <persName corresp="#p_BW1">Barbour</persName> will be

                                explanation of my views on both of the subjects you raised. The
                                activities of terrorist organizations, openly encouraged by Arab
                                Governments, present grave problems for our security. It is
                                axiomatic that the solution does not and cannot lie in giving them
                                free rein or impassively suffering their assaults on life, limb and
                                property in Israel. No government could ever be expected to accept
                                such a course. We are adopting various methods to cope with this
                                terrorist campaign, bearing in mind the considerations which you
                                have explained to me. We are also doing our best to secure
                                international understanding of our dilemma and of the motives and
                                necessities which govern our response. In the last resort our
                                responsibility for the lives and security of our people must be
                                overriding.</p>
                            <p>“In response to your message of April 6, I acted promptly to reassure
                                Jordan in connection with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                                    >Jarring</persName>'s efforts. My impression is that King
                                    <persName>Hussein</persName> is aware of our attitude on this
                                matter, but is inhibited by <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                                    >Nasser</persName> from moving ahead. The fact is that
                                Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>'s
                                conference proposal for meetings with our government was accepted by
                                Israel, rejected by the U.A.R. and has not been accepted by
                                Jordan.</p>
                            <p>“The critical state of the <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                                    >Jarring</persName> Mission is thus due to Cairo's attitude. We
                                have made every reasonable attempt to promote a negotiated
                                settlement. We offered a broad agenda for discussion. We agreed to
                                negotiate on all the matters included in the Security Council
                                Resolution within the framework of the establishment of a permanent
                                peace. We stated that the boundaries are negotiable in peace talks.
                                We accepted the procedure suggested by Ambassador <persName
                                    corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> in the hope that his
                                presidency of a peace conference would give assurance to the U.A.R.
                                and Jordan <pb n="311" xml:id="pg_311" facs="0339"/>and ensure an
                                equitable procedure as well as an agreed neutral venue. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s response was to reject all
                                these openings, to insist on our commitment to return to the June 4
                                situation, for which there is no international authority whatever,
                                and to reiterate that he wished to ‘implement’ a Security Council
                                resolution while rejecting its central principles—namely, peace,
                                agreement and recognition. His public utterances as well as the
                                views conveyed to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                                    >Jarring</persName> make it clear that he is not seeking an
                                honorable and peaceful settlement with Israel.</p>
                            <p>“On April 23, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                                    >Jarring</persName> told Foreign Minister <persName
                                    corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> that by ‘implementation’ the
                                U.A.R. means unconditional withdrawal of Israel forces in the first
                                place to the June 4 lines. This is the very proposal which you, Mr.
                                President, through your official spokesman, have described as a
                                prescription for the renewal of hostilities. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s attitude is dictated by
                                the negative principles of the Khartoum Conference: no peace, no
                                agreement, no recognition. His policy is thus to refuse all progress
                                towards peace, to accumulate armed strength, and to bide his time
                                until he is in a position to renew his aggression which he
                                unsuccessfully organized in 1967. This policy is totally opposed to
                                that which you, Mr. President, proposed on June 19, 1967. So long as
                                the U.A.R. policy is so sharply contrary to yours and ours, I doubt
                                if any formulation can bridge the gap. There has to be a will for
                                peace, and the test for such a will is readiness to negotiate.</p>
                            <p>“The question which we are now exploring is whether Jordan is
                                willing, on its own account, to discuss a settlement with us. We are
                                energetically seeking to clarify and promote this prospect. I do not
                                know yet if it is a realistic one. I have myself had several talks
                                with Palestine Arab leaders who wish Jordan to take a positive step.
                                We are also trying every means including the good offices of
                                Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> to bring
                                about meaningful negotiations which, as Secretary <persName
                                    corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> wrote to Minister <persName
                                    corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> on February 13, are the crux of
                                our problem. Despite disappointment, it is important that Ambassador
                                    <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> remain available
                                in the coming weeks while efforts are under way to clarify the
                                possibility of a Jordan-Israel negotiation. King
                                    <persName>Hussein</persName> seems to be oscillating between two
                                pressures—that of Cairo and the terrorist movements which desire to
                                escalate the present tension, and that of his own objective
                                interests. He has not always acted in his own true interests, as we
                                all learned last June.</p>
                            <p>“The central cause of the deadlock created by Cairo is <persName
                                    corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s intention to launch a
                                successful war as soon as he is ready. So long as he believes this,
                                he will not allow any peaceful process to mature. It follows that
                                our principal aim should be to diminish his belief in the prospect
                                of Israel becoming weak. We come back to the fact that the balance
                                of strength in the coming months is the critical issue. Is it not a
                                matter for further action and concern? This issue is immediate. It
                                is <pb n="312" xml:id="pg_312" facs="0340"/>
                                <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s conviction that he
                                is in the process of overtaking Israel's armed preparedness that
                                leads him to refuse negotiation and to work for the frustration of
                                the <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> Mission. As we
                                survey the Middle Eastern scene, we cannot forget for a moment the
                                threat to Israel's very existence which developed overnight last May
                                and June against all the prevailing estimates at the time that
                                    <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> would not and
                                could not raise the tension in the area for some years.</p>
                            <p>“The matter which we discussed in your home in Texas last January has
                                thus become very acute. When we spoke of the Phantom aircraft, you
                                said that you would make a decision on the matter, one way or the
                                other, during the course of 1968, in the light of developments, if
                                necessary, even within the next few months. At the same time, you
                                requested a review of the requirements for the training of personnel
                                and information on the latest date on which you could make a
                                decision to supply Israel with Phantoms and for Israel to be in a
                                position to fly them in January 1970.</p>
                            <p>“On the broad Middle Eastern level, you told me that you were
                                investigating <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s
                                posture and situation, the Soviet role, and the French policy on the
                                supply of 50 Mirage aircraft ordered by us.</p>
                            <p>“I hear that these three questions have now been clarified with
                                disturbing results. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
                                has refused peace and opted for war preparations, with his eyes
                                fixed on a growing decline in Israel's deterrent power. The Soviet
                                Union has rejected all approaches designed to induce restraint in
                                arms supplies to Arab states. The U.S.S.R. is certainly not
                                promoting attitudes of peace. The French Government, to our deep
                                regret, has made it clear that we have no reason to expect delivery
                                of the Mirage aircraft. Moreover, they have lately decided to supply
                                Iraq with 50 Mirage aircraft. In these circumstances, <persName
                                    corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s policy of refusing peace
                                and preparing for a new round of war derives a certain rationality
                                from the concrete prospect of a changing balance in air strength.
                                The postponement of a United States decision on the Phantoms now
                                becomes very grave. The decision is vital on logistic grounds, but
                                it is even more urgent for political and psychological reasons which
                                affect the immediate prospect of a peaceful accommodation.</p>
                            <p>“May I submit, Mr. President, that it is vital your decision be made
                                now. May I urge that the 50 Phantoms be supplied from the middle of
                                1969, and not from the beginning of 1970, in batches of 8 to 10 a
                                month and not of 4 to 5 a month. Training arrangements should be
                                replanned accordingly. We wish to avoid another war just as ardently
                                as we wanted and tried to avoid the last one. If we are to succeed,
                                our deterrents must be credible, and if deterrence fails, our
                                strength must be adequate. An American decision of this kind, far
                                from disrupting any attempts at peacemaking, would by demonstrating
                                the futility of further war, give the peace effort the stimulus
                                which it is now objectively <pb n="313" xml:id="pg_313" facs="0341"
                                />lacking. I do not believe that we shall get peace unless we move
                                to foreclose the other alternatives.</p>
                            <p>“Mr. President, I write to you on the eve of Israel's 20th
                                anniversary. Israel came into being against the background of the
                                destruction of a third of our people at the hands of the Nazis. In
                                the twenty years of its existence, it had to fight three wars for
                                its survival. Throughout this period only the maintenance of the
                                minimum arms balance has saved it from destruction. I appeal to you
                                on behalf of my people to grant us the weapons necessary to prevent
                                further war and to encourage the process towards peace which though
                                it tarries will-with God's help-surely come.</p>
                            <p>“In conclusion, Mr. President, may I send you my fervent wishes for
                                the success of your statesmanlike effort to bring an honorable peace
                                to Southeast Asia and to the world. History will salute your efforts
                                and bless your toil.”</p>

                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> called on Mr.
                            <persName>Rostow</persName> to deliver a copy of a letter from Prime
                        Minister <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName> to the President.<note
                            n="2" xml:id="d158fn2">See <ref target="#d157">Document
                            157</ref>.</note> He had delivered the letter to the State Department
                        earlier.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador stated that since the June War, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                            >USSR</gloss> has almost completely rearmed the Arabs, and in some cases
                        they have more and better equipment than before the war. In addition, the
                        French have agreed to deliver Mirages to Iraq. Not only have the French
                        refused to deliver previously promised Mirages to Israel, but Israel has
                        received nothing from other sources. Logic does not govern in the Near
                        East—even in Israel—and war could break out at any time. Therefore, Israel
                        needs an immediate decision on Phantoms.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Rostow</persName> said that he had already read the letter.
                        Because an agreement between Israel and Jordan appears to be one of the few
                        hopes for peace, we are puzzled by Israeli activities, especially in
                        Jerusalem. They can only make it harder for <persName>Hussein</persName> to
                        conclude a separate peace. The President is very concerned about the long
                        run prospects for Israel if peace proves impossible.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> said that Israel
                        must be in a position to defend itself. In January it was agreed that the
                        Arabs would be able to resume hostilities in eighteen months, so even the
                        proposed Phantom delivery schedule would have the first aircraft arriving
                        six months too late. Mr. <persName>Rostow</persName> corrected the
                        ambassador, saying that it was agreed that the Arabs might be in such a
                        position in eighteen months.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador continued that Israel is doing its best to make it possible
                        for <persName>Hussein</persName> to negotiate, but that he was unable to
                        resist pressure from <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>. He could
                        say with assurance that Israel's Jerusalem parade had not affected
                            <persName>Hussein</persName>'s ability to negotiate. When Mr.
                            <persName>Rostow</persName> said it affected the political atmosphere
                            <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> said that the
                        strengthening of Prime Minister Talhouni in the recent cabinet shuffle was
                        far more significant in limiting <persName>Hussein</persName>'s freedom of
                        action.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador returned to his main point: As the Arabs see Israel growing
                        weaker, they become less inclined to make peace. Israel is weaker
                        now-relative to the Arabs-than it was in June. The question, he said, is how
                        finely a nation can cut its margin of security when its existence is at
                        stake; “I'm sure your margin is far wider.”</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Rostow</persName> promised to send the letter to the President
                        immediately.</p>

                            29, summarized a luncheon conversation that day between Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> and Assistant
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName>. The conversation
                            ranged over a number of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> issues and
                            focused on the <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> Mission.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> indicated that the
                                <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> continued to tell the Soviet
                            Union that the principal difficulty in getting peace talks started was
                            Israeli unwillingness to agree to implementation of Resolution 242.
                            (Ibid.)</note> I telephoned Mohamed Riad of <gloss target="#t_FonOff1"
                            >FonOff</gloss> this morning offering to brief him. Offer was accepted
                        with alacrity. <persName corresp="#p_RM2">Mohamed</persName> took extensive
                        notes of conversation.</p>
                    <p>2. At conclusion of conversation I said I wanted to say a few words on my own
                        and could assure <persName corresp="#p_RM2">Mohamed</persName> that I was
                        entirely uninstructed in the premises. I viewed events of the last few weeks
                        with increasing concern. <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> seemed to be
                        walking trance-like down ever diminishing corridor of labyrinth from which
                        there seemed no practical exit. I was frankly fed up with stale slogans,
                        accusations that my government was practicing deceit and <gloss
                            target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> tendency hide behind sterile phraseology.
                        If this was true in case of myself, who was personally committed to
                        improvement of US-<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> relations, <persName
                            corresp="#p_RM2">Mohamed</persName> could imagine effect on others in
                            <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> who did not feel so personally
                        involved. I would not be at all surprised, I continued, if <persName
                            corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> were getting equally fed up with
                            <gloss target="#t_GUAR1">GUAR</gloss> attitude and tactics.</p>
                    <p>3. I had been extensively briefed by <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1"
                            >McCloy</persName> on his conversation with President <persName
                            corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>. I had noted with interest <persName
                            corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s statements which envisaged a
                        process whereby various instruments respecting cessation of belligerency,
                        withdrawal, etc., were arrived at and then put in escrow until whole package
                        was ready for simultaneous implementation. Perhaps this did not represent
                        any basic change in <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> position but it did
                        have some refreshing nuances and implicit recognition that some kind of
                        negotiating process was essential. <persName corresp="#p_RM2"
                            >Mohamed</persName> referred to <gloss target="#t_FonMin1"
                            >FonMin</gloss>'s three proposals re implementation of resolution after
                        Israel had agreed to implement. I said this was all very well but it was
                        negative, stale and sterile. It seemed to me that if someone in <gloss
                            target="#t_GUAR1">GUAR</gloss> could say to <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                            >Jarring</persName> what <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
                        had said to <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName>, it was just
                        possible <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> would have some new
                        elements to work with. I recalled that in absence any real progress, it
                        quite likely Swedish Government <pb n="316" xml:id="pg_316" facs="0344"
                        />would be inclined ask UNSYG release <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                            >Jarring</persName> return to his normal diplomatic duties.</p>
                    <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_RM2">Mohamed</persName> undertook to convey

                            corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> had highest regard for <persName

                        Thus far the contacts have been preliminary. <gloss target="#t_FYI1"
                            >FYI</gloss>. <persName>Rostow</persName> had suggested to <persName

                            <persName>Hussein</persName>. In view of reports from Amman of Jordanian
                        interest in such talks, and indications that there was motion on that front,
                        we had been carefully studying your telegrams on the subject, and
                        considering various contingencies. We prefer to wait until asked before
                        offering our good offices. End <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>.</p>

                    <p>I have the honour to convey to you my deep appreciation for the position you
                        have taken by supporting the Resolution of the Security Council on April 27,
                            1968,<note n="2" xml:id="d161fn2">On April 27 the Security Council
                            discussed a letter from the Permanent Representative of Jordan
                            protesting the proposed Israeli parade through East Jerusalem. A
                            resolution proposed by the Delegations of India, Pakistan, and Senegal,
                            which called upon Israel to refrain from holding the military parade
                            scheduled for May 2, was adopted unanimously. (<gloss target="#t_UN1"

                        refrain from holding the Military Parade which it intended to hold on May 2,
                        1968.</p>
                    <p>I have no doubt that your position was based on your disapproval of the
                        actions taken by Israel in the City of Jerusalem and its refusal to comply
                        with the Resolution adopted by the General Assembly at its special session

                        conviction that such an action by Israel is an illegal act. This illegal act
                        on the part of Israel has its adverse effects on the efforts of the Special
                        Representative of the Secretary General aiming at the realization of the
                        peaceful settlement of the serious crisis in the Middle East which resulted
                        from the Israeli aggression against Arab countries and the people of
                        Palestine on June 5, 1967.</p>
                    <p>Israel's defiance of this Resolution which you have supported and which was
                        adopted unanimously by the Security Council, and Israel's declaration of its
                        intention not to implement that Resolution is a grave matter which seriously
                        affects the prestige of the United Nations and its effectiveness, and in
                        fact its future as an international organization set up for the maintenance
                        of peace and justice. Israel's persistence in its defiance of the
                        resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly underlines its
                        insistence on pursuing the policy of force and the imposition of the fait
                        accompli resulting from aggression to realize territorial expansion and
                        perpetuate the disregard of the rights of the people of Palestine.</p>

                    <p>I would urge you, Mr. President, to exert all efforts to compel Israel to

                        strive to strengthen, and thus insure the preservation of its prestige and

                            >Bergus</persName> that letters from President <persName
                            corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> to the heads of government
                        represented on the Security Council would be published the following
                        day.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_GA1">Ghorbal</persName> asked permission to make a
                        few comments on the Arab-Israel situation. The ten months since the war and
                        the five months during which Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                            >Jarring</persName> sought solution represented a long and agonizing
                        period for peoples whose lands were under harsh occupation. The United
                        States had a great interest in peace in the area and Arab governments looked
                        to it to exert its influence to force Israel to accept and implement the
                        U.K. resolution.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary commented that invariably other governments felt we had greater
                        influence in third capitals than we actually had. It puzzled him that when
                        governments could discount U.S. influence in their own capitals they
                        ascribed such power to the U.S. in other capitals. It would be refreshing if
                        for a change a government would say “What should we do in the U.S.
                        view?”</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_GA1">Ghorbal</persName> said the Secretary was
                        deeply mistaken if he felt the U.S. lacked influence in Cairo. Despite the
                        lack of diplomatic relations, words and actions of the U.S. were taken most
                        seriously. He noted that in the days immediately following passage of the
                        U.K. resolution his government had taken the position that Israeli
                        withdrawal from all occupied territories was a prerequisite to further
                        action. The fact that his government changed its position to view the
                        package as a whole could be attributed to U.S. efforts in Cairo and
                        Washington.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked whether the U.A.R. was cooperating fully with Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> and had accepted his
                        proposals.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_GA1">Ghorbal</persName> said that he believed he
                        could answer affirmatively. The U.A.R.G. had suggested three possible venues
                        for discussions under Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                            >Jarring</persName>'s auspices: the Security Council, discussions in New
                        York with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>, or
                        specific proposals for implementation by <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                            >Jarring</persName> with the various governments.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary assured Dr. <persName corresp="#p_GA1">Ghorbal</persName> that
                        President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s letter would be
                        transmitted immediately to the President and would be duly considered.</p>

                        not agree) and that the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> is the main
                        obstacle (true). He says that Israel is investigating fully the chance for a
                        bilateral settlement with <persName>Hussein</persName>, but he does not know
                        yet whether this is realistic. (In fact, <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1"
                            >Rabin</persName> was pessimistic.) Finally, he argues that <persName
                            corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> will turn to political settlement
                        only when he is convinced that he has absolutely no hope of a military
                        victory. He urges that we begin delivery of the Phantoms in mid-1969 at the
                        rate of 8-10 a month.</p>
                    <p>I agree with <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName> and <persName
                            corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> that Israel's security margin is
                        thin. Our intelligence people are probably right in estimating that Israel
                        could handle any Arab threat at least through 1969. But with the French
                        refusing to deliver Mirages and literally no other suitable source of supply
                        left but us, I can understand why <persName corresp="#p_EL1"
                            >Eshkol</persName> is worried about seeing our decision held up when
                        delivery is still a year off at best.</p>
                    <p>Moreover, he faces real political pressures in his Cabinet to exert maximum
                        pressure on us—a point Eppie made yesterday when I called, at your
                        instruction, and told him pressure on the President was most unwise.</p>
                    <p>I also agree that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> no longer
                        seems inclined to reach a political settlement. <persName>Hussein</persName>
                        (and <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName>) say <persName
                            corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s internal base is too shaky to
                        permit it. Some think he might have moved if the Israelis had <pb n="321"
                            xml:id="pg_321" facs="0349"/>been more forthcoming with <persName
                            corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> in January; but we'll never know
                        whether our not pushing them harder then lost a major opportunity. (I doubt
                        this because I have come to the reluctant conclusion that <persName
                            corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> is constitutionally incapable of
                        settling down to peace.)</p>
                    <p>This raises two questions: <list>
                            <item>—whether we should now do all in our power to bring about an
                                Israel-Jordan settlement—the next possibility;</item>
                            <item>—and whether our aircraft decision could play a role.</item>
                        </list>
                    </p>
                    <p>Although he asked not to have his name associated with it, <persName
                            corresp="#p_EE1">Evron</persName> has hinted twice to Hal Saunders and
                        me that if we strengthened Israel (with Phantoms) <persName corresp="#p_EL1"
                            >Eshkol</persName> might be able to stick his neck out farther in
                        reaching toward a political settlement with
                        <persName>Hussein</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Theoretically, it might be possible to use the Phantoms to bargain for enough
                        of a marginal shift in Israel's position to improve chances for a settlement
                        with <persName>Hussein</persName>. We could not expect Israel to give up
                        anything major, and we could not guarantee success. But it is at least worth
                        considering whether any US move would help.</p>
                    <p>Some of us believe that it would improve chances for a settlement with
                            <persName>Hussein</persName> if Israel would: <list>
                            <item>—commit itself via a Cabinet decision to withdraw from most of the

                            <item>—back off from its insistence on direct open negotiations and a
                                formal peace treaty, at least at the beginning of
                                negotiation.</item>

                    </p>
                    <p>I have been trying for several weeks to get State at least to judge whether
                        these or any other such steps are worth our pressing on Israel. Nick
                        Katzenbach is completing a review this Friday. So far, the State Department
                        seems so divided that no concrete recommendation seems likely to emerge. Yet
                        almost everyone agrees that positions are hardening and another round of
                        fighting—perhaps with Soviet involvement—seems the most likely outcome.</p>
                    <p>I must also report that some responsible people feel it would be a major
                        mistake to decide now to sell Phantoms. They point out that the Arab-Israeli
                        military balance is no less favorable for Israel than it was last June. They
                        also point out that Soviet arms shipments have leveled off and that our
                        Phantom decision would risk pushing the Soviets into additional shipments
                        and ruin our best chance of getting a grip on the arms race. (You will have
                        a paper from General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>
                        tomorrow and one from us.)</p>
                    <p>It will take State and Defense some days to review again all elements in the
                        Phantom decision. I feel strongly, however, that we are <pb n="322"
                            xml:id="pg_322" facs="0350"/>approaching-if we have not already passed-a

                    <p>You may wish, therefore, to consider a special meeting to go over this whole
                        situation and, in particular, to hear argument on three points: <list>
                            <item>—should we press Israel to make a maximum try for a settlement
                                with <persName>Hussein</persName>?</item>
                            <item>—should we relate the Phantoms to such an effort, as <persName

                            military balance between Israeli and Arab forces now and 12 to 18 months

                            summary of present and projected Israeli and Arab equipment inventories.
                            Except for aircraft, the Israelis probably have as much equipment now as
                            at the beginning of the June war. The Soviets have not delivered fighter
                            aircraft to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> since September <pb
                                n="323" xml:id="pg_323" facs="0351"/>or October of last year which
                            places Egypt about 65 fighters short of the pre-war level. Deliveries to
                            Syria and Iraq have increased those countries' inventories above the
                            pre-war level. Soviet arms shipments to the area are now continuing at
                            about the pre-war level and no new-type materiel is known to have been
                            delivered. Including total deliveries to date, the Arabs are at about
                            75% of the pre-war level. Eighteen months from now, Israel will have an
                            aircraft inventory 15% to 20% above pre-war levels while the Arab
                            inventory will remain essentially at its pre-war strength; however, a
                            greater disparity in high performance aircraft numbers to the detriment
                            of Israel will develop. Ground equipment inventories on both sides will
                            remain at approximately pre-war levels. Israel's relative naval
                            capability will have improved due to the addition of guided missile
                            patrol boats.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>Our previous estimates on the Arab-Israeli balance have accounted for
                            not only equipment levels, but the qualitative superiority of Israeli
                            forces in such areas as training, intelligence, logistics, motivation
                            and morale, and leadership. In these areas, the Israeli forces are still
                            far superior to the Arabs and will remain so in the months ahead. In
                            addition, the territory the Israelis control places them in better
                            defensive position than they previously occupied, and they now have more
                            combat-seasoned personnel. The Arabs do not currently possess the
                            capability effectively to operate or maintain Soviet equipment. The
                            Soviets, through their training and advisory efforts, (see Enclosure

                            educational deficiencies and poor morale. The Soviets believe that at
                            the present rate of progress, it will take the <gloss target="#t_UAR1"

                        <item>While we note increased Soviet naval presence in the Mediterranean, it
                            is our conclusion that the Soviets wish to avoid any direct involvement
                            which could lead to a widening of a resumed Arab-Israeli conflict or
                            confrontation with the United States. In this connection, there is still
                            no Soviet air in support of their Mediterranean naval forces. A
                            miscalculation on their part cannot be discounted, but we believe that
                            Soviet efforts would be limited to materiel and advisory assistance such
                            as we have seen in the past. In February we exchanged information on the
                            Middle East situation with the Israeli Director of Intelligence. While
                            there were several differences, we were in general agreement on our
                            assessments of Arab capabilities and Soviet activity in the area. We

                            V's. Although France is continuing in effect an embargo on these
                            aircraft, there are indications that there is a fair chance that Israel
                            will eventually get delivery. The French have now agreed to sell 54
                            Mirages to Iraq; however, the delivery of these aircraft, not scheduled
                            to begin until late 1969 or early 1970, would not affect the relative
                            balance in the period under discussion. Non-delivery of Mirage aircraft
                            to Israel handicaps Israel's air-to-air capability now and in the future
                            as discussed below.</item>

                                Cables and Memos, 3/68-5/68)</note> is a comparison of the current
                            and projected high performance aircraft (MACH 2) capabilities of Israel
                            and those Arab states likely to participate in a resumption of
                            hostilities. This disparity in high performance aircraft inventories is
                            the principal cause of Israel's concern. The comparison shows that the
                            inventory of these aircraft for the contiguous Arab states will increase
                            over the next 18 months by close to 70% (230 to 390) while the Israeli
                            capability of 55 Mirage IIIs remains relatively constant. Thus, Israel
                            would be handicapped in the battle for air superiority unless early
                            bombing attacks on Arab airfields were exceptionally successful. Arab
                            experience last June is not likely to allow the Israelis the degree of
                            success in destroying aircraft on the ground that they enjoyed at that
                            time. If Algeria's capability of 29 aircraft by the end of the estimate
                            period is added to the Arab total, numerically, Israel would face a
                            potentially unfavorable ratio of about 8 to 1. This raw ratio must be
                            adjusted by the aircraft ready status, 50% to 70% for the Arabs versus
                            80% to 85% for the Israelis, and the qualitative factors such as skill,
                            leadership, and command and control mentioned above. Delivery of the
                            French Mirages to Israel would reduce the unfavorable raw ratio to 4 to
                            1 with further balance being approached through use of the same
                            adjustment factors.</item>
                        <label>7.</label>
                        <item>Considering all these factors, it is my judgment that Israel
                            currently, and probably for the next 18 months, has the capability to
                            defend itself effectively against the Arab forces. This judgment is
                            based on an estimate that the outlook for significant overall
                            improvement in Arab military capabilities, despite Soviet assistance, is
                            only poor to fair. The most imprecise element in this judgment is the
                            relative high performance air strength, hinging in part on actions by
                            the French. Even <pb n="325" xml:id="pg_325" facs="0353"/>here, the time
                            at which an imbalance would become critical, in the event of a continued
                            French embargo, allows us to continue to withhold a decision on
                            additional aircraft sales to Israel until late this year. A decision can
                            be made as late as 31 December 1968 and delivery of F-4E aircraft
                            started in January 1970 at the rate of approximately 4 per month from
                            production presently scheduled for the <gloss target="#t_USAF1"
                                >USAF</gloss>. This would get the F-4E aircraft in the hands of the
                            Israelis at approximately the same time Iraq would receive Mirage
                            aircraft. Necessary training could be commenced as late as 1 January
                            1969 in order that Israel would have a capability to maintain and
                            operate the aircraft upon delivery.</item>
                        <label>8.</label>
                        <item>I consider that we should keep the matter of numbers of high
                            performance aircraft in Arab inventories under continuing review. Should
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> or other sources provide
                            additional high performance combat aircraft to the radical Arab states
                            during the next 6 to 12 months, should deliveries of such aircraft be
                            expedited, or should the French definitely back out of their agreement
                            to provide 50 Mirages to Israel, the relatively favorable forecast set
                            forth above would be invalid.</item>

                            <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> on May 2 I took occasion
                            stress importance US attaches to <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> as
                            indicated by Secretary's message to him of April 29, and urged that
                                <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> give full support toward
                            endorsement of treaty in <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> and that
                            Israel announce its preparedness to sign treaty.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>Among others, I used argument that this problem transcends other
                            issues that Israel has everything to gain in being forthright in
                            supporting treaty and nothing to lose by doing so. Adverting to position
                            advanced by some responsible Israelis that uncertainty as to Israel's
                                <pb n="326" xml:id="pg_326" facs="0354"/>intentions in a nuclear
                            field constitute a deterrent to the Arabs and that consequently Israel's
                            interests dictate that it be one of the last and not one of the first to
                            sign, I said this seemed entirely fallacious argument to me. It
                            inconceivable that Israel with its history would ever contemplate using
                            a nuclear bomb and that consequently the deterrent of uncertainty was
                            greatly diminished. On the contrary the risks of uncertainty are high
                            and to achieve Arab renunciation of the nuclear threat the best tactic
                            would be for Israel to be the first to endorse and sign the treaty. In
                            any event if such tactic did not lead to Arab response the favorable
                            political effect for Israel in the councils of the world would be very
                            great.</item>

                            the matter and his appreciation that Secretary's message confirmed our
                            determination to do everything we can to obtain support. He did not take
                            issue with the US position. On contrary at end of somewhat lengthy
                            conversation he expressed agreement that Israel should support the
                            treaty and should make known that support at an early stage of the
                                <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> debate. Whether he can convince

                        <item>I met this morning (May 5) with President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                                >Nasser</persName> for more than an hour and a half. He made the
                            following points.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>We must very clearly understand that he has a severe internal problem.
                            He and his Cabinet are completely opposed to war. He does have elements
                            in the armed forces who would welcome a return of fighting because of
                            the humiliation of the June war and because they now have better
                            training and “technical help.” He does not agree and has told his
                            officers in a recent meeting that he would not be willing to risk war
                            again and felt that we should make every effort to achieve <pb n="328"
                                xml:id="pg_328" facs="0356"/>peace. It is clear, however, that he
                            must give some lip service to the attitude of his soldiers.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>He also said that there were “other elements” in the country who would
                            welcome a return of hostilities and that we must understand that he had
                            to deal with these elements in his own way.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>He said the restoration of diplomatic relations with the U.S. was,
                            from his point, desirable but it ran contrary at this moment to public
                            opinion until there was at least some signal from our side that we
                            wanted to implement the Security Council resolution and would not
                            continue to talk in such terms as “in the context of” or other terms
                            which he described as vague and as supporting the Israeli view. He said
                            “I am not asking arms nor aid. I am simply asking a clear unequivocal
                            statement that the U.S. supports the resolution and the propositions in
                            President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s
                            statement.”</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>He discussed the <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> formula
                            but was undoubtedly not entirely familiar with its wording because he
                            asked me twice to lend him a copy and spent several minutes reading it
                            carefully and finally said “There is nothing in this formula that I can
                            object to.” He also stated, however, that he would not want to oppose
                            amendments offered by Jordan if they were insisted upon. Again, he
                            regards statements by the U.S. as being equivocal and of trying to
                            unilaterally define the meaning of the November resolution of the
                            Security Council in a manner consistent with Israeli ambitions.</item>
                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>He stated that he would “plan to see” <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                                >Jarring</persName> on his return to Cairo on the 10th and that he
                            would discuss tonight with his Cabinet the acceptance of the <persName
                                corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> formula. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> said “I am not going to quibble
                            about words in the <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> formula
                            if both sides will approach it in good faith. However, I must make it
                            abundantly clear that neither I nor any other Arab leader could possibly
                            have direct talks with the Israelis in New York, although they were
                            perfectly willing to work through <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                                >Jarring</persName>.”</item>
                        <label>7.</label>
                        <item>He asked me if I thought my country was prepared to have a constant
                            state of tension in the Near East simply because the Israelis demanded
                            directed negotiations.</item>
                        <label>8.</label>
                        <item>I replied by saying that it was not in my power to express my
                            country's policy and certainly not to express an opinion about the
                            position of the Israelis.</item>

                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> reiterated the same points
                            made by Riad as to territory and stated his willingness to open the
                            Canal to Israeli goods and finally to Israeli ships but by
                            stages.</item>
                        <label>10.</label>
                        <item>He spoke for several minutes on the unrest and frustrations of the
                            youth of the country, not only here but elsewhere, and [stated?] that
                            for the first time in his administration internal problems had to
                            dictate a substantial part of his policies.</item>
                        <pb n="329" xml:id="pg_329" facs="0357"/>
                        <label>11.</label>
                        <item>He also stated that he wanted me to make very clear that his country
                            “was not going Communist.” He said “If I am gone, the probable result
                            will be either a new war with Israel or a complete unwillingness to make
                            peace on any terms.” Both the President and Riad emphasized their
                            concern about their growing economic dependence on the Soviets and Riad
                            stated “We have sold our cotton so far in the future that I don't know
                            how we will meet all our obligations.” The President emphasized that he
                            would welcome any attitude on our part that would give him an excuse to
                            turn away from the Soviets, although he said “I am not asking you for
                            military equipment.” He informed me that Ali Sabri had left his
                            government and he knew that Ali Sabri had been regarded as a Communist
                            but he said “For your information, even he deplores the involvements
                            which are forced upon us by your attitude with the Eastern bloc because
                            our natural friends are the West.”</item>
                        <label>12.</label>
                        <item>We talked considerably about commercial activities and he stated he
                            had told his Cabinet before and would mention it again that there must
                            be much greater emphasis on private enterprise in this country. Our
                            talks went to petroleum, fertilizer, land reclamation, the resumption of
                            the tourist trade and a host of other similar subjects indicating his
                            great concern with Egypt's economic condition.</item>
                        <label>13.</label>
                        <item>He has gained weight since I saw him last, has restored his sense of
                            humor and appears much more relaxed.</item>
                        <label>14.</label>
                        <item>He urgently said that in the absence of any other more formal
                            communications between our countries he hoped that I would come
                            frequently and asked if I couldn't stay a few days to continue our
                            talks. I told him I was leaving tomorrow for London.<note n="3"

                        was that he believed we had already crossed period of generalities and

                            <persName corresp="#p_BLD1">Battle</persName> must know <gloss

                        one entity? <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> says this raises
                        fundamental question as to how <gloss target="#t_GUAR1">GUAR</gloss> could
                        cooperate with <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>. <gloss
                            target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> would like ask <persName

                    <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_RM2">Mohamed</persName> then said that of course we
                        have something in mind. At this point he read from lengthy memorandum

                    <p>8. Memorandum states that <persName corresp="#p_TY1">Tekoah</persName> met

                            >Jarring</persName> March 8. <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                            >Jarring</persName> said Jordan refused his formula in its present form
                        but might accept it if it indicated readiness parties accept and implement

                            >UAR</gloss> was withdrawal without peace, negots, agreement, or

                            corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> as saying that was exactly <gloss
                            target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> position. <persName corresp="#p_EA1"
                            >Eban</persName> suggested two alternatives: A) acceptance of <persName
                            corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> formula in its present form with
                        indication Israel would accept if Egypt accepted; or B) “to seek agreement

                    <p>9. Memorandum continues that <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>
                        told Washington of foregoing and Washington sent report to “all of its
                        Missions including Jordan.” On March 20 <persName corresp="#p_SHM1"
                            >Symmes</persName> met Rifai and told him of <persName corresp="#p_TY1"
                            >Tekoah</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>
                        conversation. On same day <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>
                        arrived Jordan and spoke to Rifai who indicated Jordan did not accept his
                        formula. <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> did not refer to any
                        alternative by Israel.</p>
                    <p>10. Memorandum continues that <persName corresp="#p_SHM1">Symmes</persName>
                        then informed Washington as <gloss target="#t_Dept1">Dept</gloss> suspected
                        that <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> had not conveyed
                            <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName>'s suggestions for one reason
                        or another. <gloss target="#t_Dept1">Dept</gloss> sought clarification
                        through two channels: A) Bunche who stated <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                            >Jarring</persName> had reported he had never heard this language; B)
                        Israel which indicated <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> did not
                        really submit any suggestions or alternatives but was thinking out loud.</p>
                    <p>11. <persName corresp="#p_RM2">Mohamed</persName> said <gloss
                            target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>'s conclusion was that <persName
                            corresp="#p_TY1">Tekoah</persName> gives info which <gloss
                            target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> distributes to all its missions. It is
                        wrong information and US reps under false impressions.</p>
                    <p>12. <persName corresp="#p_RM2">Mohamed</persName> then returned to Ghorbal
                        memorandum to report that Israelis told <persName corresp="#p_BW1"
                            >Barbour</persName> March 10 that <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                            >Jarring</persName> had told them March 7 that Egyptians did not accept
                        his formula and insisted on withdrawal as preceding anything else. <persName
                            corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> then met <persName corresp="#p_BW1"
                            >Barbour</persName> March 16 and said Egyptians trying by all means
                        affect withdrawal without any conditions <pb n="332" xml:id="pg_332"
                            facs="0360"/>and then to open Canal for all ships except Israel.
                            <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> said Washington had made
                        Israelis believe <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>'s position was more
                        tolerant than reality.</p>
                    <p>13. Memorandum continues that in discussion March 15 Rifai told <persName
                            corresp="#p_SHM1">Symmes</persName>: A) <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                            >Jarring</persName> had stated that he had not conveyed to Israel any
                        negative position as set forth by <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                        <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>; B) “Cairo stressing not only
                        implementation but also that Israel must accept putting resolution into
                        action and want withdrawal start before anything else.” (End of
                        memorandum.)</p>
                    <p>14. <persName corresp="#p_RM2">Mohamed</persName> said <gloss
                            target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> had spoken to Amman re para 13. Rifai
                        believes there contradiction between points A) and B). Rifai had asked
                            <persName corresp="#p_SHM1">Symmes</persName> about this. <persName
                            corresp="#p_SHM1">Symmes</persName> expressed belief there had been
                        misunderstanding.</p>
                    <p>15. <persName corresp="#p_RM2">Mohamed</persName> said all these reports make
                            <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> very uneasy. He returned to
                        what <persName corresp="#p_BLD1">Battle</persName> had said. In point B he
                        said both Egypt and Israel were wrong. What did this mean?</p>
                    <p>16. <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> could not understand <persName
                            corresp="#p_BLD1">Battle</persName>'s point F. He reiterated that <gloss
                            target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> had accepted resolution. Before
                            acceptance,<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> had insisted on
                        unconditional withdrawal, it now accepted withdrawal under conditions.
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> had accepted <gloss target="#t_SC1"
                            >SC</gloss>
                        <gloss target="#t_Res1">Res</gloss> which involved important
                        concessions.</p>
                    <p>17. <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> turned to point I. It is again
                        regrettable because in every speech <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                            >Nasser</persName> made he spoke of a peaceful solution, even in his
                        speech to the military. <persName corresp="#p_BLD1">Battle</persName> should
                        be aware that whenever <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> met
                        important American personalities he insisted on a peaceful solution.
                        Whenever <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> met <persName
                            corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> he spoke of peaceful solution.</p>
                    <p>18. As to <persName corresp="#p_BLD1">Battle</persName>'s point J, what does
                        this mean when it is said at a time that the potentialities of both sides
                        are not equal? Israel is occupying Arab land and has declared its annexation
                        of Jerusalem and Gaza. US position as expressed by <persName
                            corresp="#p_BLD1">Battle</persName> can only mean supporting Israel's
                        imposition of its demands. Arabs cannot accept cession of parts of their
                        lands.</p>
                    <p>19. <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> asks if in these circumstances
                        he concludes US supporting Israel. Is he wrong? Such declarations and
                        actions do not help in bringing peace to the area and do not help at all in
                        establishing better relations between US and the Arabs. <gloss
                            target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> concluded that he reacted so strongly
                        to this report because it quoted Battle for whom he has highest personal
                        regard. If it had come from somebody else in <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                            >USG</gloss>, he would not have cared.</p>
                    <p>20. I said I greatly regretted being subjected to this confusing mass of
                        detail. I detested arguments ad personam. They could only lead to
                        difficulties in personal relationships which were essential to improving <pb
                            n="333" xml:id="pg_333" facs="0361"/>relations between states. I was at
                        least glad that this time <gloss target="#t_GUAR1">GUAR</gloss> chose to
                        complain directly to us. I was extremely tired of hearing complaints re US
                        position and actions made to third countries. What bothered me most about
                        foregoing was timing of this demarche.</p>
                    <p>21. At this point <persName corresp="#p_RM2">Mohamed</persName> said “Stop
                        right there.” He said, “I know you are going to say <persName
                            corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> is coming tomorrow. I say to you
                        again stop right there. All I will say about <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                            >Jarring</persName> is that I will give you a full briefing not later
                        than Saturday morning.”</p>
                    <p>22. <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> I think above tirade shows tendentious,

                                attitude on our part that would give him an excuse to turn away from
                                the Soviets.</item>
                            <item>—<persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> asked if we will
                                accept constant Near East tension simply because Israel demands
                                direct negotiations.</item>

                    <p>It looks now as if <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> will move to
                        New York and continue his talks there in hopes of getting substantive talks
                        started. This letter encourages Egypt in a general way to participate.</p>
                    <p>The main issue has been whether to reply at all since this was a circular
                        letter (though delivered personally to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1"
                            >Rusk</persName>). Most of us feel that this is a ready-made
                        opportunity—not only for making the move toward <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                            >Nasser</persName> we have long thought desirable but also for restating
                        your commitment to your five principles of last June 19. (Most Arabs feel
                        we've moved away from them to back Israel's insistence on direct
                        negotiations, a peace treaty and territorial gain.)</p>
                    <p>I have no illusions about winning <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                            >Nasser</persName> over. However, if there is to be any hope of a
                        political settlement, the Arabs must see some hope that we, at some point,
                        will at least take a fair middle position between Arab and Israeli claims.
                        This letter would not solve the problem but it would be a useful start.</p>
                    <p>You will be interested in the attached intercept (Tab C)<note n="4"
                            xml:id="d170fn4">Not attached.</note> which describes how Bob McNamara
                        hopes to move into the Egyptian situation. He has a report from his staff
                        saying that the Egyptians don't know how to make the most of the Aswan Dam's
                        water and power and the Soviets aren't helping. Bob feels there may be a
                        chance for him to move in there in the right political context, and he has
                        obviously begun exploring.</p>

                    <p>I have just received and read your letter of May 1.<note n="2"

                    <p>For years we have regretted the failure of the parties to find a settlement
                        to the Arab-Israel problem which would command general satisfaction. Now,
                        for the first time since 1948, there is an opportunity to move toward peace.
                        For the sake of all peoples concerned, that opportunity should be
                        seized.</p>

                        resources have been devoted to armaments for use against each other. There
                        has been far too much reliance on force to settle problems in the Middle
                        East—a region which cries out for economic and social development and which
                        could organize the resources for the task.</p>
                    <p>It is time for a change, and the Security Council Resolution of November 22
                        states the purposes and principles which should govern it.</p>
                    <p>As you know, we have strongly supported that resolution as consistent with
                        the statement I made on June 19, 1967. That statement and the resolution
                        embodying its essential principles have been, and will remain, the firm
                        basis of our policy. We believe a settlement consistent with the principles
                        set forth in my statement and the resolution can be reached if the parties
                        concerned can arrive at an agreement on substantive details within the terms
                        of the resolution. To this end we have encouraged all parties to cooperate
                        with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> and believe
                        that his mission provides the best means for reaching an agreed
                        solution.</p>
                    <p>In this regard, I have been encouraged by the indications of your readiness
                        to cooperate with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>.
                        When he is able to organize a serious discussion of substantive issues, it
                        should be possible <pb n="337" xml:id="pg_337" facs="0365"/>for the United
                        States and other interested nations to use their influence in the interest
                        of a just and durable peace in accordance with the resolution of November
                        22.</p>
                    <p>Success will require our most energetic personal efforts. As you know, Mr.
                        President, I recently made the decision not to seek another term as
                        President of the United States because I believed I could do more in this
                        way to advance the cause of peace—in the Middle East as well as in Vietnam.
                        But you and I know that, important as the efforts of my country may be,
                        peace with justice will not come unless the parties to this long conflict
                        themselves want peace badly enough to struggle for it.</p>
                    <p>With every good wish,</p>

                            Jerusalem</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Security Council for the past several
                        days has been giving further consideration to the question of Jerusalem;
                        Jordan has been pressing for a Security Council resolution that would call
                        upon Israel to rescind measures which Israel has taken in Jerusalem over the
                        past months which Jordan believes are prejudicial to an ultimate
                        settlement.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> reports that,
                        while he has worked hard in trying to convince Jordan and other Security
                        Council members to avoid further formal action by the Council, it will be
                        necessary for the United States to acquiesce in a resolution if we are not
                        to be almost totally isolated in the Security Council. Both we and
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> are agreed that a
                        Security Council proposal calling on Israel to rescind past measures would
                        be strongly objected to by Israel and would be totally <pb n="338"
                            xml:id="pg_338" facs="0366"/>disregarded. We therefore have taken a
                        strong stand against such a proposition. However, with prospects better that
                        there will be discussions under Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                            >Jarring</persName>'s auspices in New York on the question of an
                        over-all settlement, we believe the Council's work should be directed
                        towards a resolution consistent with our policy and past public
                        pronouncements and one which would not prejudice either side's position on
                        Jerusalem. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> made a
                        strong statement in the Council to which the Israelis reacted favorably,
                        stressing that the Council should not pronounce itself substantively on the
                        Jerusalem issue in such a way as to prejudice an ultimate settlement or
                        prejudge the final and permanent status of Jerusalem. He also stressed that
                        the Jerusalem problem, like other aspects, should be part of the over-all
                        agreement between the parties.</p>
                    <p>The U.K. has drafted a resolution based on the approach taken by Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> in this statement, which
                        we believe the U.S. should support.<note n="2" xml:id="d172fn2">This draft
                            is attached but not printed.</note> Caradon, the U.K. representative,
                        believes it may be necessary to include references to previous General
                        Assembly resolutions and to add some specificity, in particular references
                        to exploitation of land and legislative and administrative actions, in order
                        to achieve agreement in the Council. While we should continue major efforts
                        to avoid such language, we believe we could agree, if necessary, to support
                        an appropriate preambular reference to past General Assembly resolutions as
                        well as more specific language regarding actions in the City. References to
                        past Assembly resolutions would avoid an explicit obligation on the part of
                        Israel to rescind earlier measures as called for in those resolutions.
                        Israel would have preferred no formal Security Council action, and in
                        particular would prefer to avoid reference to the previous Assembly
                        resolutions. While we cannot be categoric, we are inclined to feel the
                        Israelis would not make a major issue of a U.S. vote for such a resolution,
                        however, particularly in light of the fact that we would be totally isolated
                        if we did not do so. We note, for example, that their attitudes regarding
                        the present proceedings in the Security Council have been largely in
                        tactical terms in the context of <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1"

                    <p>2. Riad picked up language in both President's and <persName
                            corresp="#p_BLD1">Battle</persName>'s messages re <gloss
                            target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> communication to <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                            >Jarring</persName> of May 9.</p>
                    <p>3. Riad said he did not attach too much substance to another piece of paper
                        added to <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> Mission. <persName
                            corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>'s own formula already subject to
                        three interpretations: <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>'s, Israel's and
                            <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>'s. He had given note to
                            <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> because <persName
                            corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> said it would be helpful and because
                        he wanted to show that <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> could play with
                        words just as adroitly as could Israel. “<persName corresp="#p_EA1"
                            >Eban</persName> gives an interview to <hi rend="italic">Le Monde</hi>,
                        I can give an interview to <hi rend="italic">Le Monde</hi>.” If present
                        situation continued, <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> would
                        move to New York and game of words would continue. <persName
                            corresp="#p_KMAE1">El Kony</persName> would merely read <persName
                            corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> telegrams from Cairo and <persName
                            corresp="#p_TY1">Tekoah</persName> would doubtless pass on messages from
                        Tel Aviv.</p>
                    <p>4. Something new must be added, said Riad. <gloss target="#t_GUAR1"
                            >GUAR</gloss> felt timetable was the answer. Riad made it clear that
                        timetable proposal had no elements of “imposition” in it. He views it as a
                        catalyst to get meaningful discussion going. He feels that if <persName
                            corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>, or big powers, or single country,
                        or group of countries could propose timetable for implementation of
                        resolution, then <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and Israel would be in
                        position comment on it, state what is acceptable, what is not and in this
                        way finally arrive at an agreed settlement. He thinks process of negotiating
                        out timetable would probably take months. But end result would be “accepted
                        settlement” and peace in the Middle East which <gloss target="#t_GUAR1"
                            >GUAR</gloss> strongly desired. While this process of establishing
                        agreed timetable was being carried out, continued Riad, it would be natural
                        for <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> to advise and consult with
                            <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> members and UNSYG as well as parties.
                        Riad made it clear that process would not succeed without fullest support
                        from <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>.</p>
                    <pb n="340" xml:id="pg_340" facs="0368"/>
                    <p>5. Riad said <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> continued maintain its
                        position it would not negotiate in same room with Israel. “Separate rooms,”
                        he said. Nor would it sign a piece of paper with Israel. “We have learned
                        not to trust Israel signature.”</p>
                    <p>6. This is where ultimate role of <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> or great

                            situation could change radically if there were a series of border

                            against Israeli retaliatory raids would have to be considered in light
                            of increased tempo of terrorist incidents.</item>

                            permit infiltration. We must recognize that Arab radical states such as
                            Syria are exploiting commando activity to create instability in moderate
                            Arab states of Lebanon and Jordan. It would seem neither in our interest
                            nor in Israel's to create internal instability in these countries.
                            Israel should, therefore, be discouraged from taking action which would
                            force Lebanon into a militant stand permitting use of Lebanese territory

                    <p>2448. 1. With all due respect, I find our arguments against timetable concept
                        as set forth para 3, State 165831<note n="2" xml:id="d175fn2">Telegram
                            165831 to <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss>, May 17, reported on a

                                <persName>Rostow</persName> persuaded the British that the timetable
                            concept favored by the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> should be
                            opposed. The Department viewed the concept as a “mechanistic approach,”
                            which deviated from the objective of promoting an agreed settlement
                            between the parties, and saw the timetable concept as a device that
                            could be exploited to substitute for negotiation and agreement.
                            (Ibid.)</note> pretty thin and unconvincing. I am certain <gloss
                            target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> will assume, once they hear of these
                        conversations from British, Italians and others (as hear they will), that
                        real reason for US opposition to timetable concept is US support for Israel
                        insistence on direct negots and peace treaty.</p>
                    <p>2. Think we would be well advised withhold comment on timetable concept until
                        at least we get <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>'s views on it.
                        It may be that <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> himself
                        considers it non-starter. Another possibility would be further discussions
                        with <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> Riad in Cairo with aim of
                        expanding timetable concept to something more to our liking.</p>
                    <p>3. I am also troubled by reference in para 6 <gloss target="#t_reftel1"
                            >reftel</gloss> to “Our understanding with Israel as to how we were
                        proceeding on whole question of talks.” This and other hints in other
                        telegrams over past couple of months make me wonder if we have a secret
                        agreement with, or have made secret commitments to, Israel which go beyond
                        President's June 19 statement and our pledge of support for Nov 22
                        resolution. Would appreciate clarification on this point.</p>

                    <p>Kuznetsov, referring to the latest statements by the <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                            >UAR</gloss> and Jordan, said that the Arabs had now made forward steps
                        toward a political solution: (1) They had agreed with the essence of the
                        resolution of the United Nations Security Council of November 22. (2) The
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> had indicated its readiness to
                        continue consultations in New York. And, (3) the <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                            >UAR</gloss> had agreed to consider the entire scope of the November 22
                        resolution. Therefore, the other side should not miss this opportunity. But
                        the position of the Israelis is not constructive. And the US has
                        demonstrated no desire to take even a quarter of a step toward resolving the
                        problem. The US should do more to take advantage of this favorable moment.
                        Present tensions could lead to even greater tensions.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that the agreement of the Israelis, the Jordanians and the
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> to have talks with <persName
                            corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> was at least a step, even though
                        small. President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> had
                        reaffirmed American support for the Security Council resolution on the
                        occasion of the recent visit of Tunisian President Bourguiba. The US will
                        support <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> in New York. We do not
                        insist upon the Israeli position that Israeli-Arab talks at this point must
                        be face-to-face. There was haggling going on between the two sides, each
                        trying to gain. The Secretary said that the US was disappointed with
                        Kosygin's reply to President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1"
                        >Johnson</persName>'s letter on the control of arms to the Middle East,<note
                            n="2" xml:id="d176fn2">For President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1"
                                >Johnson</persName>'s January 20 letter, see <ref target="#d57"
                                >Document 57</ref>. For Kosygin's February 27 message, see <ref
                                target="#d58">Document 58</ref>.</note> which Kosygin had tried to
                        condition upon Israeli withdrawal. The US feels that the Arabs must show
                        restraint. We know that countries other than the Soviet Union are supplying
                        arms to the Middle East, but US/Soviet agreement on this subject is probably
                        necessary to bring this traffic under control. The job <pb n="346"
                            xml:id="pg_346" facs="0374"/>now in the Middle East is to get both sides
                        to agree to get down to talks on the substance if progress is to be
                        made.</p>
                    <p>Kuznetsov said that he had nothing to add to the Kosygin letter on the arms
                        question. Regarding the <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>
                        Mission, the Soviets wished it success and would do their best to support
                        it. The Secretary observed that we are somewhat disappointed that <persName
                            corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> had proceeded so cautiously-so far
                        he had not talked substance, only procedure. We hope for a better result
                        from his activities in New York.</p>
                    <p>Kuznetsov said that the Soviets had given careful thought to the Middle East.
                        They believe that the Israelis must now take a step and that the US must do
                        something to pressure the Israelis.</p>
                    <p>Kuznetsov then referred to the proposal by the Security Council to establish
                        a time-table for the achievement of a solution to the Middle East problem.
                        The Secretary said that a time-table made sense only in relation to
                        implementing a solution which had already been agreed upon. If a time-table
                        is simply means for establishing pre-conditions, then all the same old
                        difficulties would arise again. Therefore, it is important for <persName

                            Israel-Nuclear-Dimona-Desalting, 3/1/68-10/30/68)</note> saying that Mr.

                        the job as U.S. Coordinator on the Israeli desalting project. Both <persName
                            corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_EE1"
                            >Evron</persName> seemed pleased.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> opened the discussion by
                        asking Mr. <persName>Rostow</persName> what he thought about the apparent
                        shift in the Egyptian position toward talks <pb n="347" xml:id="pg_347"
                            facs="0375"/>in New York. Mr. <persName>Rostow</persName> replied that
                        Israel should take it seriously, probe and make every effort to turn it into
                        something useful.</p>
                    <p>When Mr. <persName>Rostow</persName> said that is what we are doing in the
                        Paris talks on Vietnam, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1"
                            >Rabin</persName> jumped right in by pointing out that we were at least
                        probing in <hi rend="italic">direct negotiations</hi>. Mr.
                            <persName>Rostow</persName> admitted that but said that he felt strongly
                        that “this is not the time” for the Israelis to insist on direct
                        negotiations. He said that we had had contacts with the North Vietnamese
                        through third parties in nineteen countries before we got to Paris. He
                        warned the Israelis against being “too theological” in pressing for direct
                        negotiations.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Rostow</persName> went on to say that he fully understood
                        Israel's requirement for a serious <hi rend="italic">agreement between the
                            parties</hi> at the end of the process. The President's position has
                        been that we were not going to repeat the “Rube Goldberg chewing gum and
                        tape” operation of 1957. We had been with the Israelis from the time of the
                        hotline conversations on the point that, before Israel withdrew, there
                        should be a serious political arrangement that could allow the parties to
                        live together in peace. We had also felt that any such agreement at this
                        time must come from the parties to the conflict themselves. At the same
                        time, we had not been talking about what the Israelis seem to have in
                        mind-something akin to the Congress in Vienna in 1815 “with striped pants, a
                        big peace treaty, and all the trimmings.”</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Rostow</persName> returned to the question of <hi rend="italic"
                            >why <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> had made this change
                            in course</hi>. He recounted some of the reasons suggested by <persName
                            corresp="#p_ARB1">Robert Anderson</persName>'s conversation with
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>—economic difficulties,
                        political troubles, serious concern about Soviet influence in the <gloss
                            target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. Mr. <persName>Rostow</persName> said he
                        had no evidence but could not exclude the possibility that the Soviet Union,
                        recognizing the consequences for it of another round of fighting, had told
                        the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> to get on with the job of political
                        settlement.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> asked what we
                        thought <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s purpose is. He said
                        Israel must know what is at the end of the process on which they are now
                        asked to embark. Israel insists that it lead to a contractual agreement—an
                        agreement between the parties and signed by them.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Rostow</persName> agreed that there must be an arrangement that
                        binds the parties. But that can be achieved in any one of a number of
                        different ways. The important thing is to get a process started that can
                        lead to satisfactory arrangements.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador voiced his fear that all the <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                            >UAR</gloss> had in mind was for <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                            >Jarring</persName> to establish some sort of “timetable” and substitute
                        that for the contractual arrangement Israel wants. He repeated that Israel
                        must know what is at the end of the process. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SHH1"
                            >Saunders</persName> said that the Arabs had a similar requirement-to be
                        assured that there is a deal for <pb n="348" xml:id="pg_348" facs="0376"
                        />them at the end of a negotiation. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1"
                            >Rabin</persName> finally agreed, as long as Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_SHH1">Saunders</persName> was not talking about specific
                        peace terms but rather about the general principle that Israel would
                        withdraw in the context of a peace settlement.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Rostow</persName> cautioned against Israel's insisting on
                        agreement on procedures at the outset. He could understand Israel's
                        legitimate desire to know where it was headed, but he could not sympathize
                        with any request from Israel to have the Arabs “like Huck Finn prick their
                        fingers and sign in blood before talks could begin that they would sign a
                        big peace treaty at the end of it.” <hi rend="italic">The important thing is
                            to get <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> engaged in the
                            process of making peace. That, in itself, could help change the
                            political atmosphere.</hi> We have no idea where the Paris talks will
                        take us. We are hoping that when each side engages in the process of working
                        out a modus vivendi, the atmosphere will begin to improve.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Rostow</persName> opined that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                            >Nasser</persName> himself probably doesn't know where all this is
                        leading him. Israel has every right to be skeptical. <persName
                            corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> has many different strands in his
                        thinking, ranging from clear realism to the sort of thinking that took him
                        to war last June. We have always known him to be this sort of schizophrenic
                        individual, and, we can accept a healthy Israeli skepticism. What we cannot
                        accept is the possibility that Israel might not even risk engaging in this
                        process.</p>
                    <p>More important, Mr. <persName>Rostow</persName> said, was to get talking with
                            <persName>Hussein</persName>. The move to New York may be mainly
                        designed to give <persName>Hussein</persName> a cover for talking. Both
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> and Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_EE1">Evron</persName> indicated-more by what they obviously
                        weren't saying-that Israel had every intention of pursuing this course with
                            <persName>Hussein</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EE1">Evron</persName> said he differed somewhat
                        from Mr. <persName>Rostow</persName> as far as the Soviet Union's possible
                        desire for peace talks was concerned. He felt the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                            >USSR</gloss>'s purpose is to spin out talks in New York until after the
                        US election. Mr. <persName>Rostow</persName> cautioned against assuming that
                        the Soviets are that well organized or that much in control of their
                        Mid-Eastern clients. He said that we had had a number of contests with the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> all around the globe. While we
                        respect them as a capable adversary, we know they make their mistakes, and
                        no one should overrate them.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EE1">Evron</persName> replied that he saw his
                        explanation as the only way to account for the seeming illogic and
                        unexpectedness of the recent Egyptian move—a new way of showing movement
                        where actually there was none. Mr. <persName>Rostow</persName> said he
                        thought, to the contrary, that there was a certain amount of Egyptian logic
                        in this move. Particularly, the Egyptians are nationalistic enough not to
                        want to have to continue their heavy dependence on the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion, Mr. <persName>Rostow</persName> said we don't expect Israel to
                        jeopardize anything of its basic position. But we do expect Israel to try
                        with all its ability-and that is a lot-to turn this Egyptian move into
                        something <pb n="349" xml:id="pg_349" facs="0377"/>worthwhile. Both Israelis
                        agreed that this was the course they intended to follow.<note n="3"

                            with 1957 expedients believes that to abandon principle that Arabs

                            nowhere in the Resolution, it has seemed inherent in the situation that
                            there must be a negotiating process of some sort.</item>

                        <item>Genesis of timetable idea makes clear that at least some of major
                            proponents intend that it provide alternative to common understanding
                            and agreement among parties. In Egyptian usage it seems to be outgrowth
                            of “protocol of implementation,” which embodied whole concept expressed
                            by slogan “implement the resolution.” Latter idea we considered to be
                            reflective of desire avoid acceptance of responsibility for negotiation
                            and settlement. Re relationship to phased settlement, timetable of
                            course contains phasing idea inherently. Moreover, as it was expressed
                            in early stages (e.g., by <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_Amb1">Amb</gloss>. in Moscow), it seemed explicitly to
                            include some form of phasing. From background information previously
                            provided, you are also aware of role of French and Soviets in pushing
                            idea of an imposed timetable for implementation of resolution.</item>

                        <item>Word “timetable” itself need not mean mechanistic procedure and could
                            represent mode of operation compatible with our position. We note

                            “calendar” he is considering using in next phase; he may have in mind
                            something other than imposed or phased settlement in unacceptable sense.
                            As pointed out in State 165831,<note n="3" xml:id="d178fn3">See <ref
                                    target="#d175fn2">footnote 2, Document 175</ref>.</note> timing

                            resolution must obviously be part of any agreement between parties.
                            Emphasis here is on fact that timetable would be derived through
                            discussions involving parties and would be result of common
                            understanding. We have not given detailed consideration to precise
                            manner in which negotiations could be carried on, but obviously one
                            method could involve an initial outline of sequence in which elements of
                            settlement would be dealt with. Drawing up of outline would, of course,
                            have substantive impact and thus would have to be done by and with
                            parties, whatever particular method might be chosen to initiate the
                            process. To discuss timing of steps one must also discuss nature of
                            steps, and in this sense also timing and substance are closely
                            related.</item>
                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>We concerned that idea of timetable could become obstacle to progress
                            if it actually constitutes new wrapping for old Arab position or if
                            Israelis think it does—witness role of essentially harmless term
                            “implement.” We hope therefore that there will be no attempt by parties
                            or others to get agreement on its adoption, in abstract, as way of
                            proceeding. This in part is reason for our determined efforts to
                            discourage what appeared to be mushrooming support for it. In last
                            analysis <pb n="351" xml:id="pg_351" facs="0379"/>acceptability of
                            particular “timetable” proposal can only be determined by examining
                            proposal itself as it emerges, if it does, in process of <persName

                        <item>Re your query about “secret agreement,” there is, of course, no such
                            agreement with or commitment to Israel. We have made no secret of the
                            fact that, as President said last June 19, we believe that “… the
                            parties to the conflict must be the parties to the peace. Sooner or
                            later it is they who must make a settlement in the area.” It is
                            essentially this concept which underlies understanding as to how we are
                            proceeding on question of talks. It is understanding we have made
                            equally clear to both Arabs and Israelis.</item>

                    <p>In the last two months, there have been at least five new studies of the
                        Arab-Israeli military balance and its relation to our Phantom decision.
                        After going over these new papers, I did the attached summary to bring
                        together their main conclusions. Since I intended this mainly as a summary
                        that would not go beyond recent papers, I hesitated to add the last section
                        on policy questions. But I succumbed to temptation and tried to wrap them up
                        too.</p>
                    <p>What this seems to add up to is the Israelis have some legitimate basis for
                        concern. I don't see how, on the basis of our own studies, we can flatly
                        dismiss their concerns. What we do is a big question, but it <pb n="352"
                            xml:id="pg_352" facs="0380"/>might help us as a start to be absolutely
                        clear about the nature of their problem as our most recent round of studies
                        presents it.</p>
                    <p>You suggested a meeting soon to go over this, and I think that would be a
                        good idea. Perhaps something like the attached could serve as a chopping
                        block in sharpening our conclusions on where we stand.</p>

                    <p rend="flushleft">Mr. President:</p>
                    <p>I am increasingly concerned, as I know you are, about the continuing delay in
                        moving the Middle Eastern problem toward a more permanent solution. Israel
                        seems to be saying that they will not discuss the substance of outstanding
                        questions with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> in
                        the absence of face to face discussion with its Arab neighbors. Further, it
                        has refused to act with restraint in Jerusalem and has not even made such a
                        token gesture as withdrawal from the Saudi Arabian islands of Tiran and
                        Senafir.</p>
                    <p>Israel's Arab neighbors, for their part, seem unwilling to talk seriously
                        about the substance of a permanent settlement and are resting upon periodic
                        propaganda exercises aimed at both Israel and the United States in such
                        forums as the Security Council.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, the influence of the Soviet Union in such key countries as Egypt,
                        Syria and Iraq continues to grow at the expense of our and other Western
                        interests. You are familiar with the arms problem in the area and the
                        refusal of the Soviet Union to discuss the matter seriously with us prior to
                        Israeli withdrawal.</p>
                    <p>I have been trying to think of some way in which we could get this problem
                        off of dead center—a situation filled with danger.</p>
                    <p>One possibility would be that we and the Soviet Union discuss this matter
                        secretly and in complete detail-putting together a package which the two of
                        us would then try to impose upon the countries of the area. I do not believe
                        that this would work. I doubt that we and the Soviets could agree simply
                        because their and our interests are in direct conflict. I doubt that the two
                        of us could impose a result upon the countries of the area. We failed to
                        restrain Israel last June and there is serious question as to how far the
                        Russians could go with, say, Egypt and Syria.</p>
                    <p>Another alternative, which appeals to me, is that we ourselves get into a
                        more serious dialogue with both Israel and its Arab neighbors in an effort
                        to find a basis for a settlement with which both sides could live. This
                        would mean asking someone, very privately, to be in touch with both sides on
                        your behalf on a more serious basis than we have yet attempted. There is
                        some difficulty in having the same individual <pb n="357" xml:id="pg_357"
                            facs="0385"/>talk both to Israel and to the Arabs because such a person
                        might be looked upon merely as a conduit to the other side and would not be
                        treated with complete frankness. This suggests that we might ask two highly
                        competent Americans to try to see what could be done-one talking with Israel
                        and the other talking with the Arabs.</p>
                    <p>It seems to me that <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Arthur Goldberg</persName>
                        would be a good person to carry on serious talks with Israel after he leaves
                        his present <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> post. I have reason to think
                        that he would be willing to do so. He is a tough-minded man and a superb
                        negotiator and would be trusted by Israel even though points of real
                        disagreement may come up.</p>
                    <p>As for the Arabs, my mind turns to one of the following (in order of
                        preference): David Rockefeller, <persName corresp="#p_BER1">Eugene
                            Black</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">John McCloy</persName>
                        and <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Robert Anderson</persName>. I would put
                            <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Robert Anderson</persName> higher on the
                        list except for his private interests in the area.</p>
                    <p>You might wish to give this idea some thought in order that I may discuss it
                        with you at your convenience.</p>
                    <p>For your information I am attaching a summary which I asked Luke Battle to
                        prepare of all of the suggestions which we have made to both sides in the
                        Middle East.<note n="2" xml:id="d180fn2">Dated May 21; not printed.</note>
                        In thumbing through this, you will note that we have been very active in our
                        efforts but that our advice thus far has been largely ignored by both sides.
                        We have had some limited response here and there but the record indicates
                        that both sides have been very stubborn up to this point.<note n="3"

                    </list>
                    <p>Before the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, when terrorism was mounting, we launched a
                        program with the Israelis to test a number of electronic anti-infiltration
                        devices. Now the Israelis want to buy some.</p>
                    <p>About three months ago, the Israelis submitted a purchase request for
                        Munitions Control clearance to purchase 400,000 anti-personnel mines. They
                        told us these were to be used in connection with a security “fence” along
                        most of the Jordan River between Lake Tiberias and the Dead Sea.</p>
                    <p>Defense is now going ahead with the anti-infiltration devices, so Wally
                        Barbour's concern in the attached telegram<note n="2" xml:id="d181fn2"
                            >Reference is to telegram 3810 from Tel Aviv, May 22, in which
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BW1">Barbour</persName> urged approval
                            of the Israeli request for anti-infiltration devices. (National Archives

                            Central Files 1967-69, DEF 12-5 ISR)</note> is largely taken care of.
                        However, the problem of the mines remains. Unfortunately, there is both a
                        substantive and an emotional side of the problem.</p>
                    <p>The substantive aspect is that Defense Department has vigorously resisted
                        doing anything for Israel which makes the current cease-fire lines seem more
                        permanent. While recognizing this point, State believes it is important
                        enough to avert cross-border clashes that, on balance, it would go ahead and
                        help build the Israeli “fence”. When State asked the Israelis for more
                        information about the nature of the barrier they planned, Evron and his
                        counterparts in Jerusalem flew off the handle because they feel we're
                        questioning their good intentions or infringing on their sovereignty. They
                        have refused us any more information and State is trying to figure out where
                        to go from here.</p>
                    <p>We do consider the mines to be in a different category from the devices
                        because the devices are definitely a follow-on part of an earlier program
                        agreement. However, State's position may soon prevail even on the mines.</p>

                    <p>Information from both the Saudis and Israelis suggests the following chain of
                        events with respect to Tiran and Senafir since the June War: <list>
                            <item>—During, or immediately after, the fighting the Israelis landed on
                                Tiran. They either captured members of a small Egyptian contingent
                                which had recently occupied the island or confirmed that the
                                contingent had fled. We believe the Israelis then withdrew. When
                                Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BW1">Barbour</persName> toured the
                                channel in a launch from Sharm al-Shaykh early in July, he saw no
                                evidence of the occupation of Tiran by the Israelis or anyone
                                else.</item>
                            <item>—In late July or early August, 1967, the Israelis seem to have
                                reoccupied Tiran. The Saudis so reported to us, expressing deep
                                concern. We therefore approached Israel. On several occasions in our
                                discussions of this subject during October, 1967, senior Israeli
                                officials themselves confirmed that their troops were occupying
                                Tiran. One top official used the term “garrison” (Tel Aviv's 1290,
                                1311 and 1370 of October, 1967).<note n="2" xml:id="d182fn2">Dated

                        <hi rend="italic">Possible Explanations for Israeli Action</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Probably there is no single guaranteed explanation for the increasing
                        interest which Israel has shown since last summer in these two fly-blown
                        islands. But we may speculate with some precision as to what may lie behind
                        their actions. Israel has for a decade attached even greater importance to
                        free passage through Tiran than through the Canal. The Aqaba route is vital
                        for Israeli trade with Africa and Asia. More importantly, it is Israel's
                        lifeline to oil.</p>
                    <p>This vulnerability was early recognized by Egypt. In 1955, Egyptian boycott
                        regulations on Suez and Tiran traffic laid down that transit would be
                        refused only to Israeli flag vessels and <hi rend="italic">petroleum cargoes
                            destined for Eilat</hi>. When the Egyptians reoccupied Sharm al-Shaykh
                        in May, 1967, it was <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s
                        suggestion that petroleum shipments would again be stopped that most
                        threatened the Israeli economy.</p>
                    <p>Some years ago Israel constructed a small 16” pipeline to move its crude
                        imports (which originated in Iran) to the Haifa refinery. Little of <pb
                            n="361" xml:id="pg_361" facs="0389"/>this crude was re-exported.
                        However, preliminary construction has now begun on a 42” transit line from
                        Eilat to Asqalon. We believe that this decision, which seems to have been
                        taken last summer, has greatly increased Israeli interest in the absolute
                        security of the Tiran channel.</p>
                    <p>The pipeline is to have an initial capacity of 20 million tons a year to be
                        increased to 50 million a year (one million barrels/day) in a second stage
                        which would provide additional pumping facilities. Such quantities could
                        originate only in Iran. In fact, at present, they could originate only with
                        the Consortium, but all major Consortium companies have extensive interests
                        in the Arab world and have told us privately they would not use the Israeli
                        line. They could sell some oil at the export terminals to independent
                        companies who could use the Israeli line but such sales are only a small
                        portion of total Consortium sales and they could not fill the line, unless,
                        of course, additional markets west of Israel were to be developed.</p>
                    <p>There remains only the National Iranian Oil Company. At present it has access
                        to only a few thousand barrels of oil a day. Theoretically the NIOC could
                        take royalty oil in lieu of payments but the net return to Iran would be
                        much less than at present and this seems an unlikely development. However,
                        Iran has a barter deal with Rumania (although no oil has yet been shipped)
                        and the Shah has told Ambassador Meyer of his plans to embark on large scale
                        trading with other Eastern European countries. Assuming Eastern Europe is
                        willing to buy oil shipped through Israel (a not entirely warranted
                        assumption), Iran would be able to make profitable sales only by getting oil
                        from the Consortium for prices slightly above cost. And it was this point
                        which all Consortium companies refused to concede to Iran during the
                        negotiations this spring. If Iran intends to proceed with the project, the
                        Consortium will face a very serious new problem with the GOI. Also, it could
                        become difficult for Consortium owner companies to justify to some of their
                        consumers any outright refusal to participate in what could be described as
                        legitimate commercial transactions. There are, in short, many unanswered
                        questions. But Israel is going ahead with the line.</p>
                    <p>There would seem at least three good reasons why Israel would wish to develop
                        such commerce: (a) hope of profit; (b) desire to replace Suez as an oil
                        artery, thus reducing Egypt's regional and world importance and increasing
                        Israel's; and (c) interest in developing closer relations with Eastern
                        Europe and, hopefully, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, insofar as
                        the oil's destination might be Communist countries. On this latter point,
                        the sole remaining substantial portion of the Diaspora is Russian Jewry.
                        Those Israelis who oppose withdrawal from the present ceasefire lines no
                        doubt see this group as the one sure source of population required to
                        balance the increasing numbers of Arabs within Israel. While this would be a
                        very long-term proposition and is speculative at best, the <pb n="362"
                            xml:id="pg_362" facs="0390"/>desire to introduce a note of Communist
                        dependence on Israel could well be an additional factor in Israel's pipeline
                        project—and hence in its attention to Tiran and Senafir.</p>
                    <p>Whether or not the last point is valid, there may well be one further reason
                        for Israel's interest in these islands. <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                            >Jarring</persName> conceivably may work out a settlement between Israel
                        and its Arab neighbors which would include Israeli withdrawal from Sinai.
                        But Israel has made public its intention to remain on Tiran and Senafir
                        until a peace settlement is reached. This could well mean a peace settlement
                        with Saudi Arabia. Since no such settlement is even under discussion, the
                        Israelis may well calculate that their chances of a long stay on Tiran are
                        better than at Sharm al-Shaykh.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft">
                        <hi rend="italic">Conclusion</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>To sum up, Israel's renewed interest in Tiran and Senafir seems gradually to
                        have broadened since last summer. Basic security, economic and psychological
                        motives are now involved. In the light of Faisal's assurance to us, and
                        Saudi military impotence, we continue to believe that withdrawal would be in
                        Israel's overall interest. Reference to “routine patrolling” rather than to
                        a “garrison” may suggest that some rethinking along these lines is going on.
                        Because of our important interests in, and past assurances to, Saudi Arabia
                        we will continue to do everything we can to accelerate this trend.<note

                            three Fatah with machine guns”-could close the strait. Therefore the
                            Israeli position was that the Tiran issue had to be part of a larger
                            settlement package. (Ibid.)</note>

                                November, you know of our position on the ultimate disposition of
                                the West Bank and Jerusalem. You should also know that we would
                                strongly oppose any occupation of territory beyond the present cease
                                fire lines. I recognize that Your Majesty has sought to prevent use
                                of Jordanian territory to mount acts of violence across the cease
                                fire line and urge that continued efforts be made to prevent these
                                actions which promote instability and are an impediment to progress
                                toward peace. I wish also to assure you that we are continuing our
                                efforts to bring about a just settlement in the Near East which is,
                                after all, the only solution to the problem about which we are both
                                concerned.”</p>

                        summary of the talk is based on an uncleared memo of conversation, is <gloss
                            target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>, Noforn, and subject to change on
                        review.</p>
                    <pb n="365" xml:id="pg_365" facs="0393"/>
                    <p>2. The Foreign Minister explained that he had come to discuss two related
                        problems: (a) that of the Lebanese-Israeli border, and (b) the general
                        problem of an Arab-Israel settlement. (The conversation, however, was
                        limited to the first problem.) The Foreign Minister explained that since
                        June 1967 the Government of Lebanon had been concerned by a number of
                        “threatening statements” by high ranking Israeli officials with respect to
                        Lebanon's southern border. More recently, the Israelis attacked a Lebanese
                        village on the pretext that commandoes from Lebanon had caused incidents in
                        two Israeli villages. He wished to make clear that the Lebanese Government
                        had taken a firm stand against the commandoes. Commando training was not
                        permitted within Lebanese territory, and the Lebanese Army had done its best
                        to control transit of commandoes from Syria. The Lebanese Government,
                        however, could not completely insulate its borders to commandoes. The
                        Israelis should be aware that the initiative and responsibility for commando
                        activity belonged to the Ba'ath Party of Syria or those who support the
                        Ba'ath and not the Lebanese Government. In any event, the <gloss
                            target="#t_OSD1">GOL</gloss> could not accept the principle that the
                        Israeli Government had the right to attack Lebanon simply because one or two
                        incidents within Israel may have resulted from commandoes slipping through
                        Lebanese security arrangements.</p>
                    <p>3. The Foreign Minister could not believe that Israel considered Lebanon a
                        threat to its security. He stressed that the Lebanese southern border was
                        the only armistice line where practically no incidents had occurred since
                        1949. The border was recognized both as an international border, a
                        cease-fire line, and an armistice line. In addition, Lebanon was not
                        involved in the June 1967 fighting.</p>
                    <p>4. Despite all this the Israelis after the June war repudiated the
                        Lebanese-Israeli armistice agreement. The Foreign Minister thought he could
                        at least understand the rationale for the repudiation of the Jordanian and
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> armistice agreements. He could not
                        see logic, however, in the repudiation of the Lebanese agreement. It was in
                        this general framework, that Lebanon could only interpret Israeli actions
                        and statements as indicating some Israeli design upon southern Lebanon. For
                        a time the <gloss target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss> thought of taking the matter
                        to the Security Council but it finally decided that the Foreign Minister's
                        trip was a better answer. Certainly an attack by Israelis on Lebanon would
                        be in nobody's interest as it could easily result in the disintegration of
                        Lebanon as now constituted, lead to the loss of that country to the Western
                        world, and induce a radical political trend which could only cause trouble
                        for Israel. In view of the importance of this matter, the Foreign Minister
                        felt that Lebanon had the right to ask the United States as a friend and
                        major power to take a position on this matter and to use its influence with
                        the Israelis.</p>
                    <pb n="366" xml:id="pg_366" facs="0394"/>
                    <p>5. The Secretary addressed himself first to the policy question. He made
                        clear that the United States supports the present southern border of Lebanon
                        and attaches great importance to the preservation of the territorial
                        integrity and independence of Lebanon. Furthermore, we accepted without
                        qualification <gloss target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss> assurances of its
                        non-involvement in terrorist activity across its southern border. However,
                        as the Lebanese Foreign Minister had pointed out, others might well be
                        operating from Lebanon territory. The Lebanese Government should make quite
                        clear that it opposed as a matter of public policy terrorist activity. The
                        Foreign Minister replied that the <gloss target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss> did
                        not recognize or deal with commando organizations as political entities, and
                        it would continue to do everything to interdict and control terrorists. The
                            <gloss target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss>, however, could not publicly oppose
                        the activities of commandoes because what the Israelis called terrorism the
                        Arabs call resistance. Those involved were people who were trying to regain
                        their homes and were acting in somewhat the same fashion as the resistance
                        movement in Europe during the last war. He emphasized again that the <gloss
                            target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss> would not give the commandoes assistance
                        and would continue to try to prevent them from using Lebanese territory.</p>
                    <p>6. The Secretary suggested that the strongest position the Lebanese
                        Government could assume was to object to the abuse of its territory by any
                        organization or state. The Secretary continued that we had had a good deal
                        of experience in Vietnam with infiltrators and realized the problems which
                        the Lebanese Government was experiencing. We were opposed not only to the
                        raids but also against retaliation of those raids. We had made our position
                        on retaliation clear in a number of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                        resolutions. We had a special interest in Lebanon and would see if there
                        were anything further we could do with respect to the problem the Minister
                        raised. The Secretary went on to say that the fundamental problem was that
                        terrorist activity inspired retaliation and that the two in tandem prevented
                        the prospect of peace.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> continued that the <gloss

                        King <persName>Hussein</persName> and his entourage. Israel was committed
                        not to discuss this matter in detail and he was therefore limited in what he
                        could say. He could tell us, however, that <persName>Hussein</persName> was
                        ready for a peace treaty through secret, direct negotiations under cover of
                        the <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> Mission. There was an
                        argument in Israel as to whether <persName>Hussein</persName> could be
                        relied upon. Government policy, however, was to maintain the <persName
                            corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> Mission while trying to make
                        progress secretly with <persName>Hussein</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Elaborating on the foregoing, <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName>
                        said that Israel's official public policy was as set forth in Eban's four
                        points: (1) Face to face negotiations, (2) Agreement on the issues, (3)
                        Conclusion of peace treaties, and (4) steps to carry out the agreements set
                        forth in the treaties. All Israeli Government spokesmen would hew to this
                        line but their purpose now was to advance secretly toward an agreement with
                        Jordan. This cover was necessary in view of the basic differences between
                            <persName>Hussein</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                            >Nasser</persName>. Israel knew what kind of settlement
                            <persName>Hussein</persName> wanted and there was hope in Israel for a
                        settlement with Jordan. There was no more talk of overthrowing
                            <persName>Hussein</persName>. All key members of the Israel Cabinet
                        agreed that “everything will be adjusted to this policy.”</p>

                            <persName>Hussein</persName> on this course, <persName

                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> concurred.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> asked how Israel planned to

                        cooperation, explaining why negotiations with Jordan made this necessary. In
                        this connection <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> indicated that
                        Israel was thinking in a time frame of about another six weeks.<note n="2"

                            <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt Rostow</persName> summarized the
                            Israeli policy on negotiations with Jordan in a June 4 memorandum to
                            President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>. In light of
                            this information, which he noted was confirmed from sources in Jordan,
                            “we have been standing down on any effort to become more active on the
                            fringes of <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> talks.” He
                            added that <persName>Hussein</persName> might ask the United States to
                            intervene with the Israelis on substance at some point. (Ibid.)</note>

                    <p>By mid-1968, prospects for the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>-sponsored
                            <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> peace mission had clearly
                        become very limited. The <persName>Johnson</persName> administration looked
                        therefore to a renewal of secret contacts between Israel and Jordan as
                        offering a more promising basis for a bilateral agreement, which might lead
                        to a more general Arab-Israeli peace settlement. The United States
                        encouraged and followed the progress of the contacts between May and
                        November 1968. President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s
                        Special Assistant <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt Rostow</persName> kept
                        him informed about the progress of the talks. In a June 27 memorandum to the
                        President, <persName>Rostow</persName> stated, “Whether we take a Middle
                        East initiative depends, in fact, on whether Israel-Jordan talks work out.”
                        Thus far, he said, the situation was “not hopeful,” but the talks were “not
                        yet broken off.” In a September 30 memorandum, <persName>Rostow</persName>
                        described the secret contacts as “the best hope” for peace. In November the
                        Israelis proposed an agreement based upon the “Allon plan,” which posited
                        Israeli control over the West Bank, while returning political control of
                        some two-thirds of a demilitarized West Bank to Jordan. However, it soon
                        became apparent that King <persName>Hussein</persName> was increasingly
                        skeptical that Israel would offer peace terms that he could accept, and he
                        eventually broke off the talks. It was also clear to U.S. policymakers that
                        only the United States could pressure Israel to accept a peace settlement
                        premised upon its withdrawal from occupied Arab territory.</p>

                            message from the President: Your apprehensions concerning future
                            sanctity of Jordanian territory have been brought to my attention. I
                            wish again to assure you, as I did in my letter of February 11,<note

                            our close relationship and our support of the Hashemite Kingdom of

                            indicated to you, we have made abundantly clear to the Government of
                            Israel our policy toward the continued independence and integrity of
                            your country. You should also know that we would strongly oppose any
                            occupation of territory beyond the present cease-fire lines. I recognize
                            that Your Majesty has sought to prevent use of Jordanian territory to
                            mount acts of violence across the cease-fire line and urge that
                            continued efforts be made to prevent these actions which promote
                            instability and are an impediment to progress toward peace.</item>

                        would be a mistake in present situation to make clear to Arabs that they
                        faced no Israeli nuclear threat. If Israel removed the question mark from
                        this issue, it would remove a factor which Arabs must now consider in
                        approaching a peace settlement. Problem was therefore a psychological one
                        rather than question of whether or not Israel should have nuclear
                        weapons.</p>

                    <p>I have asked Pat <persName corresp="#p_DSP1">Dean</persName> to deliver this
                        message about the Arab/Israel situation because I am much concerned about
                        the way events may move during the next few weeks both on the ground in the
                        Middle East and also in New York. The very sharp exchange of fire on 4 June
                        across the Jordan and the subsequent call for a Security Council meeting
                        have underlined the ominous dangers which confront us all. I have in mind
                        also that although the 21 May Security Council Resolution on Jerusalem<note
                            n="2" xml:id="d190fn2">On May 21 the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            Security Council considered a letter from the Jordanian Permanent
                            Representative protesting actions by Israel to change the status of
                            Jerusalem in contravention of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            resolutions. Pakistan and Senegal introduced a resolution deploring
                            Israel's failure to abide by the resolutions relating to Jerusalem, and
                            declaring that all legislative and administrative measures taken by
                            Israel to change the legal status of Jerusalem were invalid. The
                            resolution was adopted by a vote of 13-0, with the United States and
                            Canada abstaining. (<gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> doc. S/PV.

                        back to the Council on its implementation, events could easily cause Arab
                        pressure to build up, perhaps very suddenly, for a return to the Council on
                        this issue, particularly as we can presumably rule out any hope of the
                        Israelis doing anything which could even remotely be represented as
                        compliance with the Resolution. All too soon, therefore, we may be
                        confronted with a call for sanctions against Israel, which would involve
                        difficult and dangerous decisions for both our countries. In the
                        circumstances, I attach the greatest importance to our exchanging views with
                        each other and to our trying as far as possible to keep our ideas on how to
                        proceed closely in line. There is the further point that we can expect an
                        approach from Mr. <persName>Malik</persName> to Lord Caradon following up my
                        agreement to Mr. <persName>Gromyko</persName>'s suggestion that the Russians
                        and we should keep in touch on the Middle East. To avoid any possibility of
                        these talks being exploited by the Russians adversely to our common
                        interest, it seems highly desirable that we should make sure that we are
                        working broadly on the same lines with you before matters of substance come
                        up in any Anglo-Soviet meetings in New York. Another reason for our getting
                        together soon is that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>
                        indicated to Lord Caradon in a recent talk that he is now thinking in terms
                        of consultation with the permanent members of the Security Council.</p>
                    <p>In these circumstances, it seems to me that it would be timely for us to
                        exchange views on the Arab/Israel situation at an early opportunity. <pb

                        on 23 June for the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meeting might, if
                        you would agree, provide a suitable opportunity for us to do this. If you
                        agree that this would be helpful, I think it would be desirable if senior
                        officials on both sides could go over the ground first, so that the main
                        problems likely to arise during the next phase can be identified and
                        possible ways of handling them can be reviewed as a basis for our own
                        discussion. I should propose to ask Sir Denis Allen to go to Washington to
                        discuss these problems with your people in the State Department and with
                        representatives of our two U.N. Delegations during the latter part of the

                                >Yafi</persName> was concerned about the Israeli shelling of a
                            Lebanese border village near Houle on the morning of June 15. The
                            Israelis claimed to be returning fire from the village but Yafi stated
                            that his government had no knowledge of terrorist activity in the area.
                                <persName corresp="#p_YA1">Yafi</persName> asked that the United
                            States exert pressure on Israel to refrain from inflaming the border
                            situation. Telegram 10177 from Beirut, June 15, reported that President
                                <persName corresp="#p_HC1">Helou</persName> was convinced that the
                            border incident was part of an Israeli effort to set the stage for
                            further action against Lebanon. In telegram 10178 from Beirut, June 15,
                            Porter recommended issuing a strong U.S. statement expressing concern
                            about the apparently unprovoked Israeli attack on a Lebanese village.

                            more Russian weapons.</item>

                        <item>We believe that this trend of growing Russian influence is not
                            irreversible. If we believed to the contrary, it would be our duty
                            recommend direct confrontation with Soviets in Middle East before things
                            get irreparably worse and contagion spreads. But we remain convinced
                            that once UAR's rational and irrational fears of Israel began to be
                            allayed, Egyptian nationalism would reassert itself to point of limiting
                            Soviet military presence and influence here.</item>

                        <item>If this line of reasoning has any validity, it follows that an early
                            and equitable settlement of Arab-Israel problem is a supreme national
                            interest of the United States. It means US must play more vigorous role
                            in promoting such a settlement for two reasons: <list>

                                <item>Despite logic of our position that parties to dispute must
                                    play leading role in settlement, fact is that after one year it
                                    has become evident that they incapable of doing so. US is thus
                                    far unable to provide necessary catalyst. As Secretary Dulles
                                    put it on August 26, 1955: “Both sides suffer greatly from the
                                    present situation, and both are anxious for what they would
                                    regard as a just and equitable solution. But neither has been
                                    able to find that way. This may be a situation where mutual
                                    friends could serve the common good. This is particularly true
                                    since the area may not, of itself, possess all of the
                                    ingredients needed for the full and early building of security
                                    and well-being.” (underlining ours)<note n="3" xml:id="d193fn3"

                        <item>We firmly believe that the US has the substantive ideas and the
                            diplomatic gifts to promote such a settlement. As to substantive ideas,
                            there are file cabinets of documents dating back from the “Operation
                            Alpha” days of 1954-1955 to the summer of 1967 as to what could be done.
                            We are either unduly modest or self-deceptive if we say <gloss

                        <item>As to tactical capabilities, we will confine our remarks to Egypt.
                            Egyptians continue in touching, if exaggerated, belief that only US can
                            produce settlement remotely acceptable to them. Our diffidence to make
                            the effort is read by them as sinister intent. Their attitudes toward
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> are now comprised of suspicion,
                            distress and, paradoxically, considerable loneliness; we believe a
                            tactical gesture from US would go far toward promoting some basic
                            rethinking throughout <gloss target="#t_GUAR1">GUAR</gloss> and instill
                            new readiness examine substantive problems involved in settlement

                        <item>We believe one useful tactical measure would be to invite <gloss

                            <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> Riad to Washington for talks

                            to commend it. For one thing we think Egyptians would leap at the
                            opportunity. Privately they would be highly gratified. Publicly they
                            could sell a Riad trip to Washington to their own public opinion and
                            that of the other Arab states as a continuation of <gloss

                    <p>Mr. <persName>Begin</persName> opened by affirming that there is widespread
                        appreciation in Israel for President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1"
                            >Johnson</persName>'s support over the past year. Then he raised two
                        specific requests: (1) that the US deliver the Phantom aircraft requested as
                        soon as possible; (2) that the US speed up delivery of the Skyhawks. He felt
                        the President's withdrawal from the election campaign gave him a unique
                        opportunity to prove that US support for Israel had nothing to do with
                        American elections and that even a President who is free from election
                        pressures will aid Israel.</p>
                    <p>He said both these requests were of the utmost importance to all members of
                        the Israeli Cabinet. Israel could not accept the idea that <persName
                            corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s threatening statements were for
                        domestic consumption alone. Moreover, Israel had to minimize its casualties
                        in any war because “Israel has little blood to spill.”</p>
                    <p>Finally, Mr. <persName>Begin</persName> said Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> had reported to the Cabinet that the
                            <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> sees a difference between a peace
                        settlement and peace treaties. Mr. <persName>Begin</persName> said he would
                        like to understand this difference.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Rostow</persName> promised to convey the Minister's concerns to
                        the President. He made clear that the President was as close to Israeli
                        security needs as he was to any major international problem. The President
                        had not yet made a decision on Phantoms, though he had put himself in a
                        position to deliver aircraft to Israel quickly if he decided that were
                        necessary. There were many factors involved, and the President alone would
                        make this decision. Although it was impossible for Mr.
                            <persName>Rostow</persName> to say when or how that decision might be
                        made, he knew that, in the President's view, peace was the overriding
                        objective. The President had told Foreign Minister <persName
                            corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> that he does not believe that last
                        June's war was an unqualified Israeli success in the long run. He believes
                        that Israel's survival depends on its acceptance as a nation in <pb n="380"
                            xml:id="pg_380" facs="0408"/>the Middle East. He does not believe peace
                        can be achieved if one party simply arms to the teeth and expects his
                        adversary to give in and come around asking for peace.</p>
                    <p>Turning to Mr. <persName>Begin</persName>'s question about peace treaties,
                        Mr. <persName>Rostow</persName> said that we had never committed ourselves
                        to one instrument over another. We felt there were numerous ways to record
                        international commitments. The important thing was to engage in a process of
                        peacemaking so that agreement could somehow be achieved among conflicting
                        interests. He reaffirmed that we understand Israel's basic objective of
                        achieving stable boundaries and acceptance by its neighbors, and we will
                        continue to pursue those objectives. But we feel that the Israelis had an
                        obligation to reach out to their neighbors and help them rise from
                        humiliation to some sort of peace settlement.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Begin</persName> made some general comments which showed little
                        inclination to accept Mr. <persName>Rostow</persName>'s general approach to
                        peacemaking, but he picked up two of Mr. <persName>Rostow</persName>'s
                        points:</p>
                    <p>He denied that Israel's right to live should be a central element in a peace
                        settlement. He said a nation's right to live derives simply from its
                        existence. There should be no question or discussion about it.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Rostow</persName> had mentioned Jerusalem as one of the most
                        difficult elements in a political settlement. Mr. <persName>Begin</persName>
                        said he could not understand why Mr. <persName>Rostow</persName> had
                        mentioned Jerusalem. Jerusalem was the capital of Israel, and Israel had
                        guaranteed full access to worshippers of all faiths. He did not believe that
                        Israel should deal with <persName>Hussein</persName> as a potential
                        protector of Moslem interests in the city. In short, he did not see any
                        alternative to full Israeli control. He wondered what solution Mr.
                            <persName>Rostow</persName> had in mind.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Rostow</persName> said quite informally that he envisioned a
                        Jordanian role in keeping the Moslem holy places and a Jordanian role in the
                        police, education and judicial systems of East Jerusalem. He saw the
                        economies of Jordan and Israel meeting in Jerusalem, and an easily
                        convertible relationship between the two currencies. While he held no
                        special brief for these suggestions, he felt that without some sort of
                        political recognition of Arab interests in Jerusalem, there was not much
                        hope for a peace settlement.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Rostow</persName> ended the conversation by saying that he was
                        more pessimistic over the prospects for peace in the Middle East (as a
                        result of his conversation) than he had been for some time. In closing he
                        said that he would like some time to hear Mr. <persName>Begin</persName>
                        speak about what he felt the Israelis' obligations were for reaching some

                    </p>
                    <p>In the general consideration of Israel's request for F-4s, I recall that the
                        Israelis have never really been forthright with us in discussing their own
                        planning on the introduction of the MD-620 surface-to-surface missiles that
                        are being built under contract in France. Despite several probes last fall
                        (e.g. our questioning of Brig. Gen. <persName corresp="#p_WBGE1">Ezer
                            Weizman</persName>, Chief of Operations, Israeli Defense Forces, and a
                        subsequent approach to Prime Minister Eshkol), all we have been told is that
                        an Israeli decision on moving from development to production of the MD-620s
                        was not imminent and that Israel had not determined the role <gloss
                            target="#t_SSM1">SSM</gloss>s might play in its overall military
                        posture. A senior Israeli Foreign Ministry official told our Charge that
                        Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName> believed we were
                        carrying our inquiries in this field too far. We were advised to ask again
                        in “18-24 months” (<persName corresp="#p_WBGE1">Weizman</persName>) or “two
                        to three years” (<persName corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName>). The US
                        intelligence community, however, indicates that an initial operational
                        capability of the MD-620 system, political considerations aside, is
                        technically possible as early as 1969.</p>
                    <p>Up to now we have used our Ambassador in Tel Aviv as our main information
                        channel out of respect for the wishes of Prime Minister <persName
                            corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName> who, for his own reasons, did not
                        want to involve the Israeli Embassy here in nuclear or missile questions.
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName>, however, has a
                        very special relationship with <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName>,
                        and as former <gloss target="#t_IDF1">IDF</gloss> Chief of Staff, is
                        familiar with the problem. I recently raised this question with Minister
                        Evron who pleaded ignorance. It seems to me that an approach now by you to
                            <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> would emphasize the great
                        weight we attach to the missile issue today in view of our pending decision
                        on the F-4s. A personal approach by you might also reassure the Israelis
                        about the security of information we are asking them to provide. They are
                        particularly touchy on this score in view of recent leaks about the MD-620
                        program.</p>
                    <pb n="383" xml:id="pg_383" facs="0411"/>
                    <p>In view of the implications for the US of this decision and the highly secret
                        nature of the Franco-Israeli missile contract, it seems to me that we
                        deserve more forthright answers than we have so far had from the Israelis.
                        Should we decide to grant the Israeli request for F-4s and actually deliver
                        them, only to find out afterwards that missile production and deployment
                        were proceeding in a predetermined fashion, the effect upon the Middle East
                        arms balance would be grave.</p>

                        he believes we're approaching another crunch point. To pave the way, he sent
                        several officials from London and New York for talks with Nick Katzenbach
                        this morning.<note n="2" xml:id="d197fn2">Notes on these talks are ibid. The
                            talks were summarized in a June 21 memorandum from <persName

                    <p>They believe pressures are mounting to throw the whole issue back into the
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Security Council. A big border
                        incident could put it there <pb n="384" xml:id="pg_384" facs="0412"/>any
                        time. In addition, the Russians seem to be angling to get it back there,
                        probably to isolate us.</p>
                    <p>We would probably lose control if the issue goes into the Security Council
                        now. There would be overwhelming support to amend the November 22 resolution
                        and to spell out the terms of an imposed settlement. If Israel refused to
                        accept, the next step would be sanctions. We'd face the demand to cast our
                        first veto, thereby isolating ourselves from the Arabs.</p>
                    <p>Our main difference with the British is that we think we may have a little
                        more time. They see July as a watershed, after which we start going downhill
                        if we let events and <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> go on at
                        their present pace. We're not sure the crunch will come quite that soon, but
                        we're not complacent.</p>
                    <p>Our other difference is that it's not as easy as they think to figure out how
                        to become more active in helping achieve progress toward a settlement. We
                        would have to persuade the Israelis to talk with us about the substance of a
                        peace settlement. So far, they have held out for direct negotiations and
                        refused to talk substance with anyone but the Arabs. Our purpose would be to
                        get for the Arabs a solid Israeli commitment to terms that the Arabs would
                        consider at least reasonable enough to talk about.</p>
                    <p>The problem is how to appear to the Israelis to be making an honest effort to
                        help and not to be selling them out. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1"
                            >Rusk</persName> will only be exploring with Stewart the pros and cons
                        and possible tactics. Obviously, he would wish full discussion with you if
                        and when he has a precise recommendation to make.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Stewart</persName> noted that <persName
                            corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> was not making significant progress
                        in his mission and he feared that a serious border incident could throw the
                        matter again into the Security Council. Sanctions might then be voted and
                        this could wreck all chances of a settlement.</p>
                    <p>The question now, said <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Stewart</persName>, is how
                        to expedite <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>'s work. The
                        British understand that the Arabs may have made some proposals. If we are to
                        move to some sort of timetable, or a series of steps on the installment plan
                        which would require something for each side at each step, there would have
                        to be some assurance that the entire program would move on to its end.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> noted that Kosygin's
                        position last fall had been that Israel should first withdraw and then
                        discussions on further steps could begin. Both Israel and Washington were
                        suspicious that Arab proposals might fall into Kosygin's pattern.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Stewart</persName> said the Soviets had shown a
                        little movement when he recently talked with Gromyko in Moscow. While
                        Gromyko said that Israeli withdrawal was the main point, <persName
                            corresp="#p_SM1">Stewart</persName> said that equally important were the
                        end of belligerency and the right of passage through the straits and the
                        Canal as well. Gromyko did commit himself to the idea that once a phased
                        program had started, it must go through to its end.</p>
                    <pb n="386" xml:id="pg_386" facs="0414"/>
                    <p>Stewart thought we must push on the two parties at issue; the Soviets would
                        probably have to push the Arabs, while the US and <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                            >UK</gloss> should press Israel to come up with some program ideas.
                        Otherwise we risk letting the situation get out of control. The Secretary
                        said he shared this sense of danger and realized that time was not working
                        in favor of a settlement. One serious incident could have disastrous
                        consequences.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary thought that there were several problems, including the fact
                        that <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> and the Secretary General
                        were not bold enough in pressing for both substantive and procedural
                        progress. Unfortunately, pushing on U Thant was like pushing on the end of a
                        piece of spaghetti; nothing happens at the other end. U Thant has not made
                        the parties realize how dangerous the situation is. Secondly, the internal
                        situation in Israel is such that outside influence has little effect on the
                        government, in which there is a contest for power. The US has tried often
                        with no result. <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName> is afraid to
                        move with <persName corresp="#p_DM1">Dayan</persName> and others snapping at
                        his heels.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Stewart</persName> said Lord Caradon feels
                        that July is the critical month. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1"
                            >Rusk</persName> was skeptical about fixing a flash point, but said
                        there is great inherent danger in the situation. Stewart said Caradon thinks
                        that even without a major incident, the problem could come back to the
                        Security Council in July. U Thant has led people to believe that there will
                        be a report from <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> in July. The
                        Arabs are counting on this and they are trying to show that they have moved
                        while the Israelis have not. Brenchley noted that the Arabs still have the
                        Security Council seized with the Jerusalem question, and they could use this
                        device to open up again in the Council.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Stewart</persName> said that if it goes back to
                        the Security Council, there will be pressure for the Council or the four
                        permanent members to take charge away from <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                            >Jarring</persName>. Brenchley thought the Soviets might aim at this
                        development. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Stewart</persName> noted that while
                        Couve was still Foreign Minister he seemed to hold the same idea.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Stewart</persName> then suggested that the US
                        and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> hold further talks on how to pressure
                        the Israelis to make substantive proposals to <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                            >Jarring</persName> and also to try to analyze the elements of a
                        settlement. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> doubted
                        that the Israeli Cabinet could agree to any realistic proposals. On the
                        other hand, if <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> made the
                        proposals, we could then push on the Israelis to accept them.</p>
                    <p>Brenchley asked how we could get <hi rend="italic">Jarring</hi> to move, and
                        wondered if we should discuss this with him. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> noted that <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                            >Jarring</persName> will be talking with the parties while he is on
                        leave. For our part, the US has found <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                            >Jarring</persName> extremely reserved and not disposed to reveal his
                        hand. Brenchley stated the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> had a somewhat
                        different line from <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>. He had
                        told them that he would welcome help from individual <pb n="387"
                            xml:id="pg_387" facs="0415"/>members of the Security Council, and that
                        he needs assistance. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>
                        thought that <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> was inclined to
                        accept suggestions, but then simply pass them along and blame the individual
                        party (i.e., Israel) for rejection.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Stewart</persName> asked if in about 2 weeks
                        the US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> could consult on what we would
                        both say to <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> and to Israel. He
                        saw little chance of this matter working itself out, and said that the
                        question is whether we work through <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                            >Jarring</persName> or through Israel. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> hoped the British would give further
                        thought to the problem, but reiterated his concern about the extreme nature
                        of any proposals the Israelis might be able to agree on among themselves.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Stewart</persName> thought that if this
                        situation persisted, <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> would
                        have to be the path.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said that <persName
                            corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName> should be thinking over the longer
                        range problem of how tiny Israel could live in a sea of Arabs, but he seems
                        unable to do this. On the other hand, said Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, the Egyptians said last summer that
                        the question of passage through the Canal and the straits could be resolved.
                        But they did not say that on June 1, 1967. The Arabs had also blocked a
                        cease-fire attempt on the first day of the war, which, if successful, would
                        have averted the fighting with Jordan and Syria.</p>
                    <p>There was some discussion about the duration of <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                            >Jarring</persName>'s mission, and Mr. <persName>Brenchley</persName>
                        said he understood that <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> would
                        remain at least until the end of August.</p>
                    <p>It was agreed that the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and US would talk
                        again in a week or 10 days. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1"
                            >Rusk</persName> said that even if they agreed on pushing <persName
                            corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>, there would also have to be work
                        done with the Arabs and Israelis.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the Canal, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1"
                            >Rusk</persName> said that we think the World Bank could play a role.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> is thinking about this,
                        along the lines of the Bank taking the Canal in escrow for a period of
                        rehabilitation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> would
                        probably visit Egypt in August, and so far as we know, <persName
                            corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> has not rejected the idea.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_SM1">Stewart</persName> agreed that the continuing raids and
                        artillery attacks on Israel risked a major Israeli reaction.</p>

                            >Ball</persName> is our Middle East man.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>: We're getting in a
                        trap in the Middle East. <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> will
                        come back with nothing.</p>
                    <p>The Russians and the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> will come back into

                    <p>An American position must be made. It will take intense diplomacy.</p>
                    <p>Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>: The
                        British want us to take joint initiative.</p>
                    <p>The <persName>President</persName>: Aren't they in a deep internal

                    </list>
                    <p>As the military credit sales revolving fund got set to close out on June 30,
                        Defense found that it had a little money left.</p>
                    <p>One place to use it would be to give Israel credit ($25 million, six years at
                        6%) for its already approved purchase of four Hawk missile batteries. Since
                        this would involve Ex-Im money guaranteed by Defense ($6.5 million), a
                        determination would be required, saying mainly that you believe the sale is
                        in the national interest and that you have taken into account its effect on
                        the local arms race. Both of these are true; this is a purely defensive
                        weapon and we have a clear interest in Israel's ability to defend
                        itself.</p>
                    <p>The real question is whether we just toss off a $25 million credit for Israel
                        with a flick of the pen without getting something for it. In view of the
                        fact that we have to obligate this money by Sunday or lose it, I believe we
                        should go ahead but make the most out of it by: (a) using it in the Congress
                        to support our argument for the new credit sales bill (this was Nick
                        Katzenbach's main reason for choosing to use this money on Israel);<note

                            <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>'s June 25 memorandum

                            to the President, <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt W. Rostow</persName>,
                            Vol. 85, 6/29-30/68.</note> (b) letting our Jewish friends here know
                        about it; and (c) asking both Luke Battle and <hi rend="italic">Wally
                            Barbour</hi> to call special attention to it among the Israelis as
                        evidence of our continuing desire to help meet Israel's defense needs.</p>
                    <p>It would be hard to ask for anything more specific from the Israelis because
                        they were prepared to pay cash, and they know why we're suddenly making this
                        offer. Nevertheless they have a number of dollar repayments from previous
                        purchases bunching up right now, and they will welcome the relief. If we
                        eventually sell Phantoms and have to sell for cash, this would help them
                        indirectly with that purchase. But this is more a matter of earning
                        ourselves a little credit than of giving in on a vital issue.</p>
                    <p>I think this is basically a good gesture. It permits us to cite the
                        additional Skyhawks we sold after the <persName corresp="#p_EL1"
                            >Eshkol</persName> visit and now this as evidence <pb n="391"
                            xml:id="pg_391" facs="0419"/>that—even though we haven't sold the
                        F-4's—we're right in there helping. It's a little easier to hold the line on
                        Phantoms when we can show steady support in other fields.</p>

                        <item>We recognize difficulties of making this assessment, particularly when
                            so many relevant factors are unclear. We, nevertheless, need your best
                            analysis of political forces now at work in Israel, especially as they
                            would relate and react to such a US initiative with Israel in first
                            instance to facilitate settlement with Arabs. Such initiative at outset
                            would probably need to focus on problem of getting substantive
                            negotiating process started and would most likely aim at getting <gloss

                            settlement without first having obtained a categoric Arab commitment to
                            face-to-face negotiations and eventual peace treaty. In taking such
                            initiative with <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> we would take pains
                            to reassure Israelis that any explorations with them are within
                            framework of June 19, 1967 policy statement and November <gloss
                                target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> resolution and we would try to make clear
                            depth and seriousness of US concern with present situation for reason
                            stated para. 1 above. Despite such assurances and explanation, we assume
                            that serious and forceful <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> effort in

                                the Israelis to break the present impasse. We agree fully with this

                                involving concessions from both sides and play an active role with
                                both the Arabs and the Israelis to bring about the necessary
                                compromises. Our present approach is more modest than this: while a
                                US representative could seek to press the Israelis to give us their
                                basic notions about a settlement, I doubt we ought go to them with
                                our own blueprint at this stage. A more realistic goal is to press
                                the Israelis to make some limited specific substantive suggestions
                                which will give <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>
                                something more to work with. We should not preclude developing our

                                greater Israeli flexibility as to modalities and the form in which
                                the agreement should take. For example, a joint or parallel
                                declaration would be every bit as binding as a peace treaty if it
                                results from an agreement between the parties.</item>

                                neighbours—particularly as not all the nuclear powers are associated
                                with the treaty. While the three-power Security Council declaration
                                is of political importance, it is a declaration of intention, and
                                not a binding commitment. Its practical effect in a specific
                                situation would depend on the three powers concerned taking a common
                                position and joint action. One of the three powers is openly hostile
                                to Israel, and has in the past threatened us with missile attack.
                                The declaration does not appear to go beyond the provisions of the
                                Charter concerning any act or threat of aggression; nor is the veto

                    <p>George has completed his review of previous work on the proposed Israeli
                        desalting plant. His brief letter to you enclosing a more detailed

                            <item>He would like to lay on a couple of further studies because prices
                                this spring in the nuclear desalting field have jumped sharply. At
                                the same time, the price of fuel oil has gone down, making
                                oil-fueled desalting more competitive. Our large planned plant in
                                California is up in the air until we can reconcile problems created
                                by these increased costs. Woods believes we should have the benefit
                                of that analysis before we go any further.</item>

                                for the desalting plant, and he would like to hear latest Israeli
                                thinking first hand. This would not involve negotiations at this
                                    stage.<note n="3" xml:id="d206fn3">

                        Israel. I think this is a good idea. I might say that I have talked to
                        George several times about this project and am happy to say he is fascinated
                        with it and has a positive attitude toward desalting. He is realistic about
                        the unresolved problems but thinks we ought to keep pushing ahead.</p>

                            We were also of course glad to follow Gromyko's suggestion that we
                            exchange views on <gloss target="#t_ME1">ME</gloss>, which could only be

                        <item>Rostow then said that we saw three key issues in <persName

                            question of agreement. He said that Riad's acceptance of resolution as a
                            whole on May 9 had seemed to us important step forward. Question was,
                            however, whether <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> in accepting
                            resolution as package included paragraph 3, with its reference to
                            agreement. We considered paragraph 3 required agreement of parties and
                            issue of whether <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> accepted this
                            concept was important. Timetable as described by Gromyko seemed to
                            assume need for prior agreement of parties and confirmation of this
                            could be critical.</item>

                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said Gromyko description
                            seemed to him quite clear on this point and he wondered what we wanted
                            Soviets to do vis-a-vis <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>.
                                <persName>Rostow</persName> said Egyptian position was not at all
                            clear to us; we sometimes had impression they wanted to have issue
                            returned to <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> for agreement on timetable
                            which would then be imposed. It was pointed out to <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> that we were not so much
                            interested in confirmation of details of timetable as outlined by
                            Gromyko but rather in confirmation that <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                                >UAR</gloss> accepts need for agreement among parties as stated in
                            paragraph 3 of resolution. <persName>Rostow</persName> said that
                            confirmation of this sort could help remove our doubts regarding
                            Egyptian intentions. He also said we were not sure that <persName
                                corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> understood Egyptian position as
                            it had been stated by Gromyko. On this latter point <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he believed <persName
                                corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> was informed.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> commented that US had
                            been very cool to whole idea of timetable in past, and he wondered if
                            our interest in Gromyko idea reflected change in this attitude.
                                <persName>Rostow</persName> replied that there was no change in our
                            position. Our impression from <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> had
                            been that timetable was to be imposed by <gloss target="#t_SC1"
                                >SC</gloss> as substitute for agreement of parties. In this sense,
                            timetable was not acceptable to us. We had never objected to a timetable
                            of implementation flowing from agreement of parties. We are now
                            questioning whether <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> had moved from
                            this position to acceptance of principle of agreement.</item>
                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>Rostow then said that second important issue seemed to us to be how
                            agreement was reached. President had said a year ago that no method
                            should be excluded. Direct talks seemed to us to be normal way of
                            seeking agreement, but we understood problem they pose for Arabs. At
                            same time concept of direct talks is acute political symbol for Israel
                            of Arab will for peace. It was our hope that clear confirmation by
                                <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> that it accepted idea of
                            agreement would make it easier to deal with question of modalities.
                            Perhaps Rhodes formula would be way to proceed. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> observed there were many
                            interpretations of Rhodes formula. <persName>Rostow</persName> said we
                            meant by it that no form of discussion was excluded. We understood that
                            at Rhodes there were formal meetings only at beginning and end.</item>

                        <item>Rostow continued, saying that third critical question was form
                            agreement would take. He noted that while Israeli position insisted on
                            peace treaty and <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> stood on Khartoum

                            pressing Israel to be flexible, but this hard to do outside negotiating

                            case. We had worked hard to achieve March 10 and May 9 decisions, but

                        involved in another round of debate on the Arab-Israeli problem; 3) there is
                        a good chance that Amb. Jarring's efforts can be kept alive on the present
                        basis at least until fall when the Foreign Ministers meet; and 4) a US or

                        from Israel will not minimize increased Soviet penetration in the Middle

                        something must be done, either alone or with the British, we should limit

                            <item>I have not commented on US-<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> talks
                                since in my view reports thereof have indicated a healthy skepticism
                                on our part as to probability and desirability of our taking
                                initiatives at this time with regard to the <persName

                                it cannot be avoided, and, in addition, perhaps more importantly,
                                whether if we decided on a joint US-<gloss target="#t_UK1"

                                retrogressive, it seems to me that although it could be better, the
                                Israeli position, so far, is supportable on its merits. They have,
                                at our urging, accepted the November resolution and have been
                                endeavoring to get their defeated adversaries into some kind of
                                substantive discussion which has been resisted by the latter on the
                                ground that they wish an advance commitment that Israel will
                                eventually withdraw to unrealistic (June 4) lines. There is also
                                considerable supplementary public evidence at least that the Arab
                                tactic only masks a real intention to do nothing politically toward

                            <item>As to desirability, or more accurately feasibility, of our

                                thoughts we might be able to evoke will not, as bargaining
                                positions, fall far short of the goals set by the Arabs and
                                therefore tend to harden Arab attitudes. Furthermore, while our

                                whether as a practical matter we would or should exert such maximum
                                measures as probably would be necessary to achieve a halfway step
                                which might or might not move the parties toward an ultimate

                            <item>Soviet penetration into the Middle East is, of course, our major

                                the theory that in the absence of a genuine US-Soviet detente

                                room for maneuver on our part to influence a minimization of Soviet
                                involvement. Rather this would seem likely to come about by the
                                Soviets' own realization that they may be over-extending themselves,
                                for example, in Egypt, or a longer range realization by the peoples
                                experiencing Soviet tutelage that such tutelage has features they
                                could better do without.</item>

                                more vocal series of minority groups which would resist concessions
                                to the end. But the whole spectrum of Israeli political public life
                                is unanimously apprehensive of initial Israeli concessions in the
                                absence of any indication that they would be matched by Arab
                                willingness to conclude binding peace. This is based on the same
                                security considerations which have been of paramount concern to all
                                Israelis for twenty years and created a climate of fear and
                                apprehension prior to June 5, 1967. Also fundamental is the fact
                                that Israel is a democracy with a government headed at present by an
                                individual who, although decisive enough on occasion, is not a
                                world, or even Israeli, figure enjoying the charisma of <pb n="403"
                                    xml:id="pg_403" facs="0431"/>Ben-Gurion, who in his long heyday
                                could take personal decisions and subsequently maneuver the
                                democratic process to a ratification thereof. Also the American
                                relationship and support of Israel, not only that of the Jewish
                                community in the US, but the broader understanding by the whole
                                American body politic, is the one practical and sustaining
                                psychological prop on which Israelis consciously or unconsciously
                                lean. Despite any reassurances we could give them as to our motives
                                therefore, US initiatives would at least arouse major
                                apprehensions.</item>

                                    <item>There would [be] no doubt a “Cabinet crisis” with the

                                        religious party. However, the Labor alignment, while shaky
                                        within itself, is now so close to a majority that <persName

                                        weather the storm, more especially since there is no

                                        despite his very widespread popular support. An American

                                        bound firmly by the November 67 Cabinet position on direct
                                        negotiations and supplemental Knesset pronouncements.
                                        However, the government in this parliamentary system can
                                        theoretically reverse such decisions and by a narrow
                                        majority the Prime Minister might win if he sought an
                                        alteration in those directives. However, binding as these
                                        decisions are they do not specify direct negotiations in the

                                    <item>As to the Israeli request for F-4 Phantoms, I am quite
                                        clear that a favorable decision on the Israeli request would
                                        have an effect on the fundamental US-Israeli relationship
                                        referred to above. It would certainly strengthen the
                                        confidence throughout Israel in US preparedness to assist in
                                        the vital field of security and would diminish the arguments
                                        of substantial sections of opinion who question whether our

                                        capabilities. Conversely further delay can do nothing but
                                        adversely affect our relationship. Any concept that we could
                                        expect the Israelis to make political concessions affecting
                                        their security in return for military hardware, including
                                        Phantoms, is in my view erroneous.</item>

                                to endeavor to press the Israelis for specific delineation of
                                substantive positions, our prospects if the <gloss target="#t_SC1"

                                    >Jarring</persName>'s efforts can be continued and kept alive on

                                York in the fall. We should, therefore, resist British nervousness
                                to the maximum extent possible. However, if your appraisal is that
                                something must be done now, or the British are so determined on
                                their course that there is no dissuading them, I strongly urge
                                instead of our coming forth unilaterally or bilaterally with
                                specific suggestions, we limit ourselves to a genuine exploration
                                with the Israelis of the whole situation as we both now see it and
                                solicit any ideas they may have as to useful further steps to be

                            repatriation not now practical alternative. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"

                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> said his reason for
                            linking Suez Canal and refugees was that until there is solution to
                            Palestine problem, he could not allow Israel flags pass through heavily
                            populated areas of Canal. He had already told <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                                >Jarring</persName> he prepared allow Israel cargoes. Seemed to him
                            this created no practical problem for Israel. Israel had plenty of other
                            places to show her flag. But Israel flag in Suez Canal presented
                            practical problem to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>.
                            Bundy countered that refugee question presented practical problem to
                            Israel requiring practical answer. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                                >Nasser</persName> said problem must be solved by Palestinian
                            leaders. Bundy felt <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
                            recognized that his was timid position but he wouldn't get off

                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> felt that if great powers
                            worked together there would be progress on Middle East. Bundy said he
                            had heard that from Soviets. If great powers had an agreed solution in
                            mind, this might be so. But neither Soviets nor ourselves had an
                            acceptable solution. While both Soviets and U.S. had influence they
                            alone could not produce progress. Bundy recalled that one year ago he
                            had counseled President <pb n="406" xml:id="pg_406" facs="0434"/>
                            <persName>Johnson</persName> that distance between two sides so great
                            there was no practical opportunity for U.S. expend political capital to
                            produce a solution.</item>

                        <item>Bundy said <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s remarks had
                            indicated an underlying belief that no political solution is in sight.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> said “Then there is
                            only one other solution.” Bundy said: “How unfortunate.”<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d209fn3"> Bundy commented on Bergus' account of his meeting
                                with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> in telegram 10757
                                from Beirut, July 5. He found it to be accurate but suggested an
                                amendment at this point. “My response to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                                    >Nasser</persName>'s hint at renewal conflict was somewhat
                                stronger than ‘how unfortunate’ and less convinced that he meant
                                what he was suggesting. My own guess is that renewal hostilities are
                                far from his personal intent, and my reaction was both stronger and
                                less credulous, as perhaps, ‘that would be most unfortunate for all
                                concerned, and surely there is a better way to be found.’”

                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> is going out next week
                        to discuss with Israel, certain of the Arabs, and others, the possibilities
                        for a settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict. He will be going first to
                        London and Paris, then to TelAviv, Amman, Beirut and Jidda (also, being very
                        closely held, he may meet the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> Foreign
                        Minister in Beirut).</p>
                    <p>We are told that State is preparing a Memorandum for the President in which
                        they propose that <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> be armed with
                        permission to reveal a “yes in principle” on the F-4s. We are not certain
                        under what conditions this “yes” might be offered, but it seems to be
                        related to the Israeli attitude on progress in the peace talks rather than,
                        for example, Israeli signature on the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> or
                        their agreement to forego missile or nuclear acquisition.</p>
                    <p>The advantages of going forward with the F-4 agreement in principle at this
                        time are as follows: Israel must be able to defend itself—there is a gap in
                        high-performance aircraft between the Arabs and Israelis—eventually Israel
                        will need U.S. aircraft in any case-the duration of the French embargo is
                        uncertain—we could reassure Israel of our support and perhaps make them less
                        rigid—we would convince the Arabs and the Soviets of the firmness of U.S.
                        support for Israel-the Arabs and Soviets may already presume we will deliver
                        F-4s and have discounted this—it would ease Congressional and public
                        concerns in this country-it would strengthen the Israeli Government
                        vis-a-vis its domestic critics.</p>
                    <p>The arguments against going ahead are: there is no real military need to do
                        so now, and we are delivering A4s-there would be an adverse impact on the
                            <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> mission-it would be
                        counter to the latest Soviet moves on Near East arms control—it would bring
                        pressure on the Soviets to supply more and better aircraft—the Mirage
                        deliveries may well go through and could be in operational Israeli units
                        almost immediately after the decision is taken by de Gaulle. This would give
                        the Israelis, at least temporarily, a sizeable “overkill”, particularly if
                        the <pb n="408" xml:id="pg_408" facs="0436"/>MD-620 missiles were also
                        delivered by France-F-4s will not deter essentially irrational Arabs—it
                        would deprive us of potential inducements to get the Israelis to be more
                        flexible.</p>

                        be kept secret but which could be made public at a later point (say,
                        October) after the progress of the possible Near East arms discussions with
                        the Soviets and the <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> efforts
                        are clearer and provided Israeli movement toward a settlement, in the coming

                    <p>Your Majesty:</p>
                    <p>I have asked Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">George Ball</persName>,
                        who has just assumed his new responsibilities at the <gloss target="#t_UN1"

                        current developments in the area. The trip to the area will give him the
                        opportunity to become fully familiar with the Middle East problem.
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> brings with him
                        assurances of our continued firm support for Jordan and my sincere personal
                        wishes for Your Majesty.</p>
                    <p>It has been more than a year since the end of hostilities. In this time there
                        has not been any progress toward the agreement called for in the Security
                        Council resolution of November 22, 1967. I fully appreciate the difficulties
                        you face in the continuing absence of a settlement, and the courage and
                        moderation you have shown in meeting them.</p>
                    <p>I assure you that the United States Government has given its full support to
                        the efforts of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> and
                        that it will continue to do so. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGW1"
                            >Ball</persName>'s visit to Jordan, and to other states in the area, is
                        evidence of our concern and of our close interest in the efforts which are
                        being made to find a way toward peace.</p>
                    <p>I shall look forward to hearing from Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGW1"
                            >Ball</persName> your thoughts on these matters. I hope that his
                        discussions with you will help lead to the just and durable settlement which
                        we all so fervently desire.</p>

                    <p>Dear Mr. Prime Minister:</p>
                    <p>I have asked Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">George Ball</persName>,
                        who has just assumed his new responsibilities at the United Nations, to
                        discuss with you and your colleagues and with certain Arab statesmen current
                        developments <pb n="410" xml:id="pg_410" facs="0438"/>in the area. I know
                        from our very useful exchange last January that you are fully familiar with
                        our policy and that you share my concern over the lack of progress towards a
                        peaceful settlement since the end of hostilities. We stand squarely on my
                        statement of June 19, 1967, and we maintain our full support for the
                        Security Council resolution of November 22, 1967.</p>
                    <p>The trip to the area will give <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">George
                            Ball</persName> the opportunity to become fully familiar with the Middle
                        East problem. I must frankly say that I fear the situation is deteriorating
                        and that it will continue to do so in the area and in the Security Council
                        unless some progress towards a settlement can be made. In particular, I am
                        asking Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> to explore
                        with you steps which your Government might be prepared to take now to
                        facilitate <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Representative <persName
                            corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>'s efforts to bring about agreement
                        between Israel and its neighbors.</p>
                    <p>I hope that you and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>
                        may have a completely candid exchange of views which will advance our mutual
                        interest in the prompt establishment of a durable and stable peace in the
                        area.</p>

                                                Arabs have recently conveyed appearance that they
                                                are more flexible and reasonable than Israel. This
                                                has been noted in Washington, in US public opinion
                                                and in other capitals. We do not know whether
                                                apparent Arab reasonableness is a mere tactical ploy
                                                or reflects substantive change. In circumstances
                                                however the implication is that Arabs want peace and
                                                Israel does not. The result is that <gloss

                                                bilateral negotiations as only way to settlement. We
                                                understand need for contractual agreement but we are
                                                not persuaded that the insistence on direct
                                                bilateral negotiations is more than a procedural
                                                maneuver. If Israel continues to stick on this
                                                point, it will lose support of other countries. We
                                                do not think Israel will persuade Arabs to agree to
                                                bilateral negotiations at least at the beginning. We

                                        while there has been some Soviet penetration, particularly
                                        in Egypt, greater weight should be given to importance Arabs
                                        attach to US role and to existence of strains in Arab-Soviet
                                        relations. There have been several developments on credit
                                        side: doctrine of withdrawal without peace is discredited;
                                        Arab-Israel situation has had large impact in recent
                                        developments in Eastern Europe; and many Communist countries
                                        now regret having broken relations with Israel. In area
                                        itself, there is now intermingling of Israelis and Palestine
                                        Arabs which can never be reversed; logic of geographic
                                        proximity is beginning to prevail. Among governments
                                        concerned there is growing skepticism about efficacy of
                                        acrimonious public debate and <gloss target="#t_GOI1"

                                        are trends which should be permitted to ripen. Nothing
                                        radically dangerous has happened since November and we
                                        should not let delay plunge us into despair. Assumption that
                                        time not on Israel's side is true only if one assumes that
                                        war is likely if present situation continues or if one
                                        assumes active Soviet intervention. Of all Arab states only
                                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> might seek renewed

                                        now senses U.S. skepticism re this idea. U.S. must take
                                        Israel's word that advanced discussions are going forward at

                                        to move from basically good posture. Israel will not
                                        withdraw from cease-fire lines except in return for peace.
                                        Withdrawal must be justified to Israeli people. In some
                                        places peace and security have territorial implications, and
                                        Israel accepts U.S. view stated by <persName

                                        Israel cannot now say where boundaries would be; nature of
                                        peace settlement will influence nature of boundaries. As

                                        Israel cannot be ostracized and in any event issues are too
                                        complex to be negotiated indirectly. Israel does not exclude
                                        third party good offices leading to fruitful
                                        negotiations—e.g., Jarring's probing of <gloss

                                        do for Arabs; U.S. could reaffirm that it wants a solution

                                        Misunderstanding may have arisen from his statement to Argov
                                        in Washington that, so long as such negotiations must be
                                        kept secret that cannot help Israel's public position.
                                        Continuation of dialogue with Jordan is useful although
                                        there are limits on how far <persName>Hussein</persName> can

                                        difficult questions lie with Jordan and that these also
                                        weigh most heavily in world opinion. One could make case for
                                        not treating opening of Suez Canal as urgent matter but
                                        issues with Jordan are pressing. To help get negotiating

                                        possible its willingness to withdraw and its will for peace.
                                        It is important to counteract cynics who tend discount
                                        Israeli statements and conclude that Israel has territorial

                            problem for him is that he has too complete confidence in what Nasser
                            says. He was not referring to contradictory statements by <persName

                            destroy Jewish people. <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName>

                        <item>Prime Minister stressed that question for Israel is one of survival.
                            Israel had not wanted war. <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName>
                            recalled <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> had waited three weeks but
                            finally it became clear there no other way out. PriMin noted that even
                            then he had sent message to <persName>Hussein</persName> stating <gloss
                                target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> desire avoid hostilities with Jordan.
                            Israel won war but in process learned it cannot rely on international
                            guarantees to protect its security. Now it cannot give away gains of
                            victory for nothing. Government which did so could not survive.
                                <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName> pointed to 1957
                            guarantees re free navigation in Straits of Tiran and King
                                <persName>Hussein</persName>'s promise he would not allow tanks he
                            received from US be deployed west of Jordan River. Prime Minister said
                            day will come when he will have to bring Israeli Cabinet to a decision
                            re steps to be taken toward a settlement. This could break up present
                            coalition. He not afraid to work with a smaller cabinet, as before
                            Six-Day War, but he cannot go before Cabinet and people empty handed.

                                target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> did not much care how <gloss

                                <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> Mission or other

                            negotiations; it could use the word clarification or any other word it
                            preferred. The important point was that <gloss target="#t_GOI1"
                                >GOI</gloss> should not appear as impaled on a procedural issue; it

                    <p>2. Prime Minister said he knows <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> view and
                        stands on earlier position that Israel will not be first to introduce
                        nuclear weapons in area. <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName>
                        pointed out, however, <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> is not only state

                        that Israel surrounded by enemies on all sides. <persName corresp="#p_EL1"
                            >Eshkol</persName> said he not seeking to link <gloss target="#t_NPT1"
                            >NPT</gloss> problem with Israeli request for Phantom aircraft but did
                        wish to point out security consideration is a major one. Israel not
                        interested in relieving Arabs of their suspicions re its nuclear intentions.
                        Barbour recalled he had said earlier this was dangerous view. <persName
                            corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> stressed that anything Israel might do
                        which would create shadow of a suspicion that it has nuclear arms aims would
                        establish an even stronger <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> security
                        claim on the Soviets. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> drew
                        attention to US-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> assurances in Security
                        Council to non-nuclear powers in case of nuclear attack. Prime Minister,
                        noting he realized he on dangerous ground, asked whether this a real
                        guarantee or rather a declaration of intention which powers may choose
                        ignore if circumstances change. Israel faces “to be or not to be”
                        situation.</p>

                        <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> SecGeneral Gideon Rafael noted
                            <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> participating in non-nuclear
                        congress which scheduled convene August 29. Rafael said outcome of

                    <p>4. Prime Minister did not challenge <persName corresp="#p_BGW1"
                            >Ball</persName>'s view but gave impression of confusion suggesting that
                        his government had been caught with fingers in the cookie jar. He referred
                        rather plaintively to GOI's situation. The clear impression gained by
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> and <persName
                            corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> was that this was a tactical move
                        related to Phantoms and did not represent position <gloss target="#t_GOI1"
                            >GOI</gloss> would hold over time.</p>
                    <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName> appeared very defensive on
                        this point and stated three times that he “would take the <gloss

                        <item>Speaking “off-the-record” on 16th, <persName corresp="#p_RZ1">Zaid
                                Rifai</persName> read to me from a letter sent to King
                                <persName>Hussein</persName> by “a British person.” The writer
                            stated that his firm had been able to locate seventy 155-mm Long Tom
                            guns which were immediately available. Shortly after finding these 70
                            guns, however, the “source of supply” had informed the writer of the
                            letter that the guns had originally come from the U.S. Source alleged
                            the American authorities had learned of Jordanian interest in them and
                            had taken steps to insure that they could not be made available for sale
                            to Jordan. The writer stated that he regretted that particular source
                            was no longer available but that he was following up certain other
                            sources (Zaid implied the other source was Turkey) and that he hoped to
                            be able to find 20 or 25 guns for Jordan.</item>

                        <item>According to <persName corresp="#p_RZ1">Zaid</persName>, King
                                <persName>Hussein</persName> is furious about the indication that
                            the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has taken steps to cut off all
                            possible sources of 155-mm guns for Jordan. The King has been making
                            noises that he will accept Iraqi offers to supply new 122 (possibly 130)
                            mm guns from the Soviet Union as a “gift.” <persName corresp="#p_RZ1"
                                >Zaid</persName> said quite a “head of steam” has built up on this
                            matter and that both King <persName>Hussein</persName> and General
                                <persName corresp="#p_KGA1">Khammash</persName> are determined that
                            they must at least make up their losses in this category of weaponry. He
                            said the King and <persName corresp="#p_KGA1">Khammash</persName> are
                            particularly upset that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> officials on
                            the one hand have been implying that 155-mm guns are not available
                            because they cannot be located, whereas, in fact, the <gloss
                                target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> seems to have taken steps to make them
                                “unavailable.”<note n="2" xml:id="d216fn2">Ambassador <persName
                                    corresp="#p_SHM1">Symmes</persName> sent an official-informal

                                July 18 emphasizing the problem posed by the 155-mm guns. He noted
                                that he had discussed the problem briefly with <persName

                                supplying such artillery to Jordan, “particularly in the period
                                prior to November.” <persName corresp="#p_SHM1">Symmes</persName>
                                referred again to the King's angry reaction and concluded: “I think
                                whatever we do we have got to come clean soon with the King. We
                                cannot continue this masquerade of ‘unavailability.’ It is causing
                                further disenchantment with us and is not a correct way to deal with
                                a friend.” (Ibid.) Davies responded in a July 25 letter that the
                                Departments of State and Defense were puzzled by the reference to 70
                                155-mm guns. “We know nothing of this and most certainly have not
                                been requested to assent to provision of 155 mm guns by the
                                British.” He added, however, that <persName corresp="#p_BGW1"

                            Israel only seeks changes in territory justified on security grounds. In
                            addition, Hussein could obtain non-territorial gains such as free

                            limits set by fact that Jerusalem is Israel's capital and must remain
                            united, Israel would stretch its imagination to find solution. Israel's
                            thinking ran towards finding formula which would comprise expression and
                            incarnation of Moslem interests. Coupled with concept of open frontiers,

                            West Bank <persName>Hussein</persName> perhaps had some flexibility.
                            Where Jerusalem was concerned, however, he was under pressure from other
                            Arabs and non-Arab Moslems. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName>
                            thought this was easiest aspect of problem since it was precisely Moslem
                            interests for which Israel was prepared make special arrangements.
                                <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> noted that neither US nor

                            since <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> would have
                            difficulty objecting to Palestinian settlement which Palestinians
                            accepted. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> also thought that

                            characterized by inconsistencies: on one hand Faisal was emotional about

                        <item>Returning to Jerusalem question, Raphael noted that there had never
                            been Moslem endorsement of Jordan's unilateral annexation of Jerusalem.
                            If Jordan had been strong enough to carry annexation off, it should be
                            strong enough to make arrangements safeguarding Moslem interests. Eban
                            commented that to pious Moslems it was intolerable <pb n="426"
                                xml:id="pg_426" facs="0454"/>for Jews to control second most holy
                            place of Islam. Israel should accept this reality in seeking Jerusalem

                        <item>Re general problem of getting negotiations started, Raphael said that
                            once Arabs realized no one would pull their irons out of fire and that
                            they must choose between status quo and progress toward new situation,
                            they would stop hoping for big power intervention. Jordan should,
                            however, realize dangers in unstable border situation. Jordan should
                            also know that, while Israel is cooperating in exploring issues, there
                            must be discussions for Israel to go as far as Foreign Minister had

                            Throughout our discussion, the King displayed philosophical detachment,
                            suggesting substantial resignation to the unhappy situation <pb n="427"

                            also referred to US assurances made to King during discussion of
                            November 22 resolution in NY and stated that “we still bore them in

                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>I then outlined presentation made earlier to PriMin, placing emphasis
                            on two questions Israelis had requested <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                                >Jarring</persName> to put to <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>.
                            Significance of these questions, I explained, was not so much their
                            content but their value as evidence that Israel tentatively seeking to
                            begin process of clarifying issues through means other than bilateral
                            negotiations at outset. I made clear that this provided opportunity for
                            Arab nations to move the situation off dead center provided <gloss
                                target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> gave sensible and not merely
                            dialectical reply to the Israeli questions. I suggested also that if
                                <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> really wanted negotiating
                            process to begin, it should accompany its response with submission of
                            question of its own, implying this was test of Arab good-faith
                            determination to seek lasting solution. To avoid misunderstanding,
                            however, I made clear that I had not recently talked with <persName
                                corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> and did not know how he intended
                            to handle Israeli questions.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>Israel was, I stated, clearly more interested in attempting to settle
                            its relations with Jordan than with the <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                                >UAR</gloss>. It wanted to find a modus operandi with its closest
                            neighbor as soon as possible, while being prepared to wait for unlimited
                            time for solution of Suez and Sinai problems. It was in this context
                            that I reviewed with King details of message that FM <persName
                                corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> had asked me to convey to the

                            as to merits or demerits of Israeli position. Moreover, the King should
                            understand that we saw the Israeli proposals as representing merely an
                            initial bargaining position.</item>
                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>The Israelis, I said, had retreated somewhat from their insistence on
                            direct negotiations at the outset and were obviously prepared for some
                            indirect exchanges with the <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> in order
                            to give the King some indication of Israeli thinking. At same time, the
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> considered it imperative that
                            the <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> be prepared to utilize <gloss
                                target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> Rifai's visit to the <gloss
                                target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> in September as the occasion for serious
                            talks with the Israelis. I told the King that I had strongly pressed on
                            Israelis that the <pb n="428" xml:id="pg_428" facs="0456"/>position of
                            doctrinal insistence on direct negotiations to exclusion of all other
                            diplomatic exchanges was totally unrealistic and self-defeating. At the
                            same time, the Arab world should understand that in our view no secure
                            peace could ever be arranged unless the Arabs were prepared at proper
                            point for some form of direct discussions leading to contractual
                            arrangement. I pointed out that as I saw it, the <gloss target="#t_GOI1"
                                >GOI</gloss> had not formulated a governmental position as to
                            precisely what kind of a settlement with Jordan they envisaged. The
                            government was in some disarray with sharply conflicting opinions among
                            the members of the Cabinet and I thought the <gloss target="#t_GOI1"
                                >GOI</gloss> incapable of making any precise plans until forced to
                            do so by the necessities of an ongoing negotiating process. Time was
                            working on nobody's side and if any progress were to be made, the
                            present excuses for inaction on both sides must be put aside. The only
                            way to begin was to begin.</item>

                        <item>King <persName>Hussein</persName> responded with quite evident
                            gratitude for President's letter and for information we had brought him.
                            He made brief general review of efforts he and <gloss target="#t_GOJ1"
                                >GOJ</gloss> had made to bring sanity into situation following the
                            war. At the Khartoum summit, he had tried vigorously, but without
                            success, to avoid the adoption of the conditions of no peace treaty, no
                            direct negotiations and no diplomatic recognition, which today were not
                            only obstructing <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> Mission
                            but also enabling Israel to exploit alleged Arab intransigeance. Since
                            Khartoum, he had tried hard to find out what the Israelis really wanted
                            but, again, without success.</item>

                        <item>Israel, the King said, had three faces. There was the religious group,
                            the hard-line expansionist and the moderate realistic element. As a
                            result, there was no consistent Israeli policy to which the Arabs could
                            address themselves.</item>
                        <label>9.</label>
                        <item>Jordan had made clear to <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>
                            and to its friends, including the US, where it stood on all aspects of
                            the Nov 22 resolution, and the King felt that Jordan must stay within
                            the framework of the resolution since there was no other clear guide to
                            settlement. The King then asked me what in our opinion he could and
                            should do to move the problem forward.</item>
                        <label>10.</label>
                        <item>I answered by referring again to the possible significance of
                            questions that Israel has asked <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                                >Jarring</persName> to transmit to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                                >UAR</gloss> and emphasized need for a constructive Arab response. I
                            referred also to <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName>'s expressed
                            hope that joint Israeli/<gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> meetings of
                            some sort might be arranged in New York in September. The King appeared
                            to agree with these ideas and both <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1"
                                >Sisco</persName> and I interpreted his reaction as a determination
                            to do all that was possible along these lines.</item>

                                >Sisco</persName> made point that the November 22 resolution is a
                            package of principles, the details of which require discussion between
                            the parties to reach a settlement.</item>

                        <item>At the conclusion of our long discussion, the other luncheon guests
                            were brought in, including PriMin and FonMin. The conversation at
                            luncheon was social in character, although toward the end of the meal,
                            in replying to general question, the <gloss target="#t_FonMin1"
                                >FonMin</gloss> stated for the benefit of the whole table that he
                            was not at all discouraged about the Middle Eastern situation and that
                            “we have moved from first phase into second phase.” The <gloss
                                target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> then observed that “if we can
                            move it to this second phase, we can start doing business.”</item>
                        <label>13.</label>
                        <item>When we took our leave after lunch, King stated with great warmth: “I
                            can't tell you what it has meant to me or how grateful I am for your
                            coming here and for what you have told me.”</item>
                        <label>14.</label>
                        <item>Impression given during entire meeting was that King was tired and
                            very serious, by no means despairing and eager and determined to get on
                            with settlement. In course of conversation, the King made two statements
                            which seemed particularly significant. One was that information we had
                            brought him from Israelis gave him “something he could get started
                            with.” The second was that Jordan and <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                                >UAR</gloss> had “different interests,” implying his willingness to
                            press for a settlement of Israel/Jordan problem alone, regardless of
                                <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> foot dragging.</item>
                        <label>15.</label>
                        <item>It seemed significant that audience with the King did not include any
                            Ministers and that at no time did tone or content suggest any of the
                            more formalized Arab position we had been given by Rifai and PriMin in
                            earlier meeting. Nevertheless, <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1"
                                >Sisco</persName> tells me Rifai seemed more attuned to King's views
                            than was case during detailed talks in NY last year.<note n="4"

                            did not say, he seemed to indicate that he personally has some
                            flexibility on the question of Jerusalem and recognized there can be no

                        Jordan.</p>
                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Summary:</hi> In two-hour meeting July 17 with Jordanian
                        PriMin Talhouni and <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> Rifai,
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> gave them his overall
                        impressions of present Israeli attitude towards <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                            >Jarring</persName> Mission and a peace settlement. While obviously
                        noncommittal and at the outset presenting Jordanian position along
                        traditional lines, reaction of Ministers gave impression that specific
                        substantive ideas which <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> asked
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> to transmit to the
                        Jordanians regarding possible shape of an eventual settlement would not be
                        dismissed out of hand particularly in light of fact <persName
                            corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> made clear our feeling that this
                        Israeli opening bargaining position. Suspicion obviously remains in minds of
                        Jordanian leaders that concrete propositions we conveyed to GOJ on behalf of
                        Israel are largely tactical gambit to, in <gloss target="#t_GOJ1"
                            >GOJ</gloss> words, “escape responsibilities of <gloss target="#t_SC1"
                            >SC</gloss> resolution”; nevertheless we had impression matter would be
                        weighed carefully.</p>
                    <p>Atmosphere of talks was influenced in part by fact that word was trickling in
                        regarding Iraqi coup. While conversation in opening round tended to be
                        rather hard expression of Jordanian view, we were impressed with Rifai's
                        very brief but objective summation of current state of play re <persName
                            corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> Mission which he gave to King
                            <persName>Hussein</persName> at lunch. For example, Rifai told the King
                        in front of us that the situation was not unhopeful, that there was some
                        movement, that <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> Mission should
                        be continued and that Jordan should continue to support him and respond
                        constructively. We had distinct impression that Rifai has bought idea of
                            <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> continuing his probes
                        between now and opening of <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> and that <gloss
                            target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> has intention of sending Rifai to <gloss

                        along.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> had excellent opportunity to get
                        across to <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> our impression that there is a
                        will toward peace in Israel though we doubted Israeli substantive position
                        on settlement would crystallize until there were discussions between Arabs
                        and Israelis which would tend to force <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
                        Cabinet to face issues and to make decisions of a substantive
                            character.<gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> seemed impressed with
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> description that we had been
                        categoric in conveying to Israelis our view that while we did not see how
                            <pb n="431" xml:id="pg_431" facs="0459"/>final settlement could be
                        achieved without parties at some appropriate stage sitting down together,
                        nevertheless insistence on acceptance of direct negotiations as condition
                        precedent was untenable posture for <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> leaders also showed interest in
                        information <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> provided them
                        regarding two specific substantive questions Israelis had asked <persName
                            corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> to pass to <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                            >UAR</gloss> in hopes that this might help get “a process” started. Fact
                        that Israelis were conveying specifics to <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                            >UAR</gloss> through <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> and
                        specifics to <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> through us seemed to make
                        some impression, though difficult to ascertain how much.</p>
                    <p>We found that <persName corresp="#p_TB1">Talhouni</persName> and Rifai agreed
                        with us that there is no value to going into the <gloss target="#t_SC1"
                            >SC</gloss> in the foreseeable future, though they obviously felt the
                        need to leave open this possibility, particularly on the question of
                        Jerusalem, should future developments require. Re Israeli desire for direct
                        contacts with <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss>, they (A) voiced suspicion
                        that <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> seeking evade obligations under
                            <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> resolutions; (B) asserted that
                        overriding need was for plan to implement resolution which <persName
                            corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> could work out; and (C) that <gloss
                            target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> “never had nor would enter separate direct
                        contacts with Israel.” In connection with foregoing, Ball stressed that
                        resolution was not a peace settlement, and that Jarring's activities could
                        help prepare way, by clearing underbrush and sharpening issues, for
                        agreement between parties.</p>
                    <p>Biggest area of doubt which developed during course of conversation relates
                        to Israeli intentions vis-a-vis <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                            >Jarring</persName> in late July or early August on which we wish
                        Barbour to follow up as he deems appropriate. Rifai was told by <persName
                            corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> that <gloss target="#t_GOI1"
                            >GOI</gloss> has promised <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>
                        map, or at least descriptive memorandum, giving its conception of secure and
                        recognized boundaries. Neither <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>
                        nor <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> received any such
                        impression from the Israelis. All <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName>
                        and Raphael indicated to us was that they intend to tell <persName
                            corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> one way or another by the end of
                        this month whether they see any real prospects for progress with the <gloss
                            target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss>. They mentioned nothing about providing
                        either <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> or the <gloss
                            target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> with maps of boundaries and we were candid
                        with the <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> in questioning Israeli
                        intention of going this far this soon, particularly in circumstances where
                        there are obvious divisions in Israeli Cabinet and no consensus reached on
                        elements of territorial settlement.</p>
                    <p>We made headway in one other way in that <persName corresp="#p_TB1"
                            >Talhouni</persName> and Rifai both agree that <persName
                            corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> should continue his probes between
                        now and opening of the <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> and that Rifai very
                        much hopes that circumstances will be such that he and number other FonMins
                        can engage in intensive consultations during opening days <gloss
                            target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> in order move things along. In fact the idea
                        of intensive effort on the <gloss target="#t_ME1">ME</gloss> among the
                        FonMins at the time of <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> opening which we
                        have been selling all along the circuit has taken hold. The only real
                        question which unhappily is crucial, will <pb n="432" xml:id="pg_432"
                            facs="0460"/>be the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> willingness to
                        send Riad. Burgus ought to be working on this on a day by day basis so as to
                        assure Riad's presence at that time. <hi rend="italic">End summary.</hi>

                            (Ibid., POL 27 ARAB-ISR)</note> Boutros stressed that Arab decision work
                        for settlement on basis Security Council resolution, involving as it did
                        willingness accept Israel as fact, was act of political courage. For Arabs
                        this made it all the more essential to stay within <gloss target="#t_UN1"

                        therefore influence Israel to give up insistence on direct negotiations and

                        saw as step by step process. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>
                        said step by step approach was unrealistic; Israel would not and could not
                        be compelled to give up its only bargaining position, namely occupation of
                        Arab territory, except in return for agreement on all issues. <persName

                        negotiations a condition precedent. Similarly we urged Arabs to recognize it
                        unrealistic expect that settlement reflecting agreement among parties, as
                        called for in resolution, could be achieved without direct talks at some
                        point down the road. <persName corresp="#p_BF1">Boutros</persName>
                        acknowledged that progress toward implementation could make direct talks

                            corresp="#p_BF1">Boutros</persName> argued that “all or nothing”
                        approach to settlement unrealistic. There was need for <persName
                            corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> or Security Council to devise
                        accommodations that could begin “disarmament of minds” on both sides,
                        without which any treaty would be meaningless. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1"
                            >Ball</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName>
                        replied that process <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> trying to start was
                        initiative by Israeli moderates; Arab response could foster or stifle
                        initiative. They expressed hope <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                            >Jarring</persName> would follow through and <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                            >UAR</gloss> would respond seriously. Re form of settlement, Ball said
                        he had impression Israel would not stick on treaty and that alternative
                        (e.g., like Soviet-Japanese arrangement after World War II) could be found.
                        When <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> noted that <gloss
                            target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> session in fall would offer opportunity
                        for quiet consultations with <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>
                        and FonMins present, <persName corresp="#p_BF1">Boutros</persName> agreed
                        but said question of whether Arab FonMins would go to NY would probably need
                        to be considered first in Arab League <gloss target="#t_FonMin1"
                            >FonMin</gloss> meeting, which he expected occur prior <gloss

                        <persName corresp="#p_BF1">Boutros</persName> also raised <gloss
                            target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss>'s concerns re Israeli intentions toward
                        Lebanon. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said he had made clear
                        to <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> how strongly US opposed any Israeli
                        actions against Lebanon and had received categoric denial of hostile Israeli
                        intentions. <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> had stressed, however, that
                        it would have to respond to serious incidents against Israel across Lebanese

                        <item>In his July 18 talks with Bundy, King <persName>Hussein</persName>
                            sought Bundy's impressions of Israel, showing special interest in
                            attitudes of <persName corresp="#p_DM1">Dayan</persName>. King stressed
                            the importance of progress toward a settlement by the year's end, and
                            the necessity of having something tangible in the form of expectation of
                            a “just” solution before he could directly confront the Fedayeen.
                            Hussein also indicated a willingness to consider some territorial “give
                            and take” in any settlement. The King was worried by the Iraqi coup, and
                            appeared concerned that sooner or later Iraq and Syria might move closer
                            together.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>Bundy stressed that he believed the Israelis genuinely want peace. He
                            encouraged the King not to waste any opportunity for indirect
                            examination of the issues with key Israeli leaders such as <persName
                                corresp="#p_DM1">Dayan</persName>; and he underlined the theme that
                            all avenues leading to an exchange of viewpoints should be explored
                            carefully. Bundy also conveyed Dayan's warning that if Fedayeen forays
                            into Israel continue, Israel might be forced again to strike at Jordan,
                            causing further population displacement. Bundy advised the King that
                            parties themselves have main responsibility for achieving settlement and
                            should not expect <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> or other outside
                            govts to do it for them. Bundy said he sensed that the King has no
                            currently active dialogue with Israelis but that he might, under some
                            circumstances, undertake an initiative with the Israelis. Meanwhile King
                            appears to hope someone else will do the job for him or at least get out
                            in front. End of summary. <list>

                                <item>Bundy had audience July 18 with King

                                    private secretary, Zaid Rifa'i, also were present. Bundy did not
                                    have opportunity before departure to clear following report of
                                    his conversation, which he gave us orally.</item>

                                <item>Bundy said his general impression was similar to that which he
                                    had acquired during King's visit to Washington last summer.
                                        <persName>Hussein</persName> knows the problems that he
                                    faces, and he appears to realize that sooner or later he will
                                    have to make a stab at solving them. Bundy felt, however, that
                                        <persName>Hussein</persName> hoped someone else would
                                    achieve a settlement for him and that at least he,
                                        <persName>Hussein</persName>, would want someone else with
                                    him if not out in front. Bundy thought
                                        <persName>Hussein</persName> had regained some of the
                                    confidence he lacked during the summer of 1967, when Bundy found
                                    him “very shaky.”</item>

                                <item>
                                    <persName>Hussein</persName> asked Bundy to talk about his visit
                                    to Israel. Bundy said he thought the Israelis really meant it
                                    when they said they want peace but that of course they want it
                                    on a secure basis. Alluding to the fact that <gloss

                                    <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> had conveyed to the
                                    Jordanians only the day before <persName corresp="#p_EA1"
                                        >Eban</persName>'s comments on the outline of settlement,
                                    and his desire for a Jordanian response, Bundy emphasized that
                                    any avenue directed at feeling out the respective positions was
                                    worth exploring. <persName>Hussein</persName> commented that the
                                        <pb n="435" xml:id="pg_435" facs="0463"/>Arab Foreign
                                    Ministers might be able to do this later in the summer in New
                                    York. The King also volunteered he considered highly important
                                    there be some meaningful progress by the end of the year. (But
                                    Bundy again felt that by progress the King did not mean
                                    Jordanian initiatives.)</item>

                                <item>King was most interested in <persName corresp="#p_DM1"
                                        >Dayan</persName>. Bundy told him he thought that Dayan, in
                                    the absence of peace, was the firmest of Israelis; yet he would
                                    be the most moderate of all and essentially the most helpful to
                                    the Arabs once peace and Israel's security was achieved. The
                                    King agreed with these comments. Bundy repeated to
                                        <persName>Hussein</persName> what <persName corresp="#p_DM1"
                                        >Dayan</persName> had said to him about the cease-fire
                                    violations and Fedayeen raids. If Jordan were unsuccessful in
                                    controlling the Fedayeen situation in the Valley (implication
                                    being Beisan area), Israel would again have to take firm action
                                    and this might mean more Jordanians would be displaced. Bundy
                                    did not use <persName corresp="#p_DM1">Dayan</persName>'s
                                    argument that deeds, not words, were what counted, but he
                                    repeated <persName corresp="#p_DM1">Dayan</persName>'s comment
                                    that it would be in the King's own interest to control the
                                    Fedayeen. <persName>Hussein</persName> responded that he could
                                    now meet any direct Fedayeen challenge to his authority but that
                                    he thought it was better to deal with the situation with
                                    indirect tactics for the time being.
                                        <persName>Hussein</persName> felt strongly that he had to
                                    have something tangible, the expectation of a “just” solution,
                                    in order to justify a direct confrontation with the
                                    Fedayeen.</item>

                                <item>Bundy commented to us that <persName>Hussein</persName> used
                                    the word “just” frequently and in much the same manner the
                                    Israelis used the word “peace.” A settlement in which all
                                    parties had confidence was the only solution, said the King. He
                                    obviously considers that Israel has given the Arabs thin soup so
                                    far. Nevertheless, he said he was continuing to pressure Nasser
                                    to continue the dialogue with <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                                        >Jarring</persName> (which Bundy took as a reference to the
                                    Israeli “two questions” posed to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                                        >UAR</gloss> through <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                                        >Jarring</persName>), and said that some progress has been
                                    made since the Khartoum conference.</item>

                                <item>Before the King arrived at the meeting, Bundy had been told by
                                    Rifa'i that Israeli terms proposed for Jerusalem were
                                    “impossible.” When Jerusalem came up with the King, the latter
                                    was not so flatly assertive. Bundy referred briefly to President
                                    Helou's idea of deliberately leaving the Jerusalem question
                                    “unsettled,” and obtaining agreement on all other issues first,
                                    but the King was unresponsive. <persName>Hussein</persName>
                                    repeated his frequently-used description of Israel as possessing
                                    three faces: the extremist one, which seeks the downfall of
                                    Jordan and Israeli occupation of the East Bank; the seemingly
                                    reasonable face, which wants a Palestinian entity; and the
                                    moderate face. The King said he has been trying to find the
                                    third face. He gave Bundy the impression that various
                                    territorial adjustments favorable to Israel could be considered,
                                    and that, for example, some territory could be given Israel in
                                    return for free Jordanian passage to the Mediterranean.</item>

                                    about a refugee solution. (Bundy noted wryly to us that

                                    <persName>Hussein</persName> pressed Bundy for information about
                                    political conditions in Washington. Bundy said that the US was
                                    heavily preoccupied with the war in Viet-Nam and with elections,
                                    and that there was little incentive to expend energy on a
                                    no-result exercise in the Arab-Israel contest. Bundy advised
                                        <persName>Hussein</persName> frankly not to depend on just
                                    the US and other outside states to find a way out, and he
                                    followed this up with the suggestion that
                                        <persName>Hussein</persName> should test the water with the
                                    Israelis, in any feasible, indirect way. Bundy mentioned that he
                                    thought <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName>'s proposals,
                                    as conveyed through <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>,
                                    constituted an asking price, a bargaining position, and
                                    suggested <persName>Hussein</persName> not be discouraged by
                                    them. In addition he proposed specifically that
                                        <persName>Hussein</persName> not lose any opportunity to
                                    send a trusted emissary to talk to <persName corresp="#p_DM1"

                            >Attached is a 5 page unattributed memorandum with the handwritten date
                            of July 6 and a subject line that reads: “F-4 Phantoms for Israel-The
                            Pros and Cons.”</note> on the difficult problem of Phantoms for Israel,
                        I come down on the side of acting now, perhaps in the form of the last
                        sentence of the memorandum.<note n="3" xml:id="d224fn3">The last sentence
                            reads: “That solution would be to tell Israel now we are prepared in
                            principle to go ahead on F-4s while deferring a decision on timing and
                            the signing of contracts and seeking to minimize and obfuscate
                            publicity.”</note> I should add that we should start the training part
                        of the exercise at once, to eliminate factors of delay if actual deliveries
                        in 1970 do prove to be necessary.</p>
                    <p>Since Luke wrote, several things have happened. To me, they reinforce the
                        argument for acting now.</p>
                    <p>I'm afraid that the newspaper publicity about <persName corresp="#p_BGW1"
                            >George Ball</persName>'s trip, and some of our diplomatic conversations
                        about it, may have given the Arabs (and the Russians) the sense that we are
                        pushing the Israelis' hand, so that they can sit back and wait. Indeed,
                        according to the last <pb n="440" xml:id="pg_440" facs="0468"/>report we got
                        from Amman (Amman 5865) (Tab B),<note n="4" xml:id="d224fn4">A copy of
                            telegram 5865 from Amman, July 24, is attached. The telegram transmitted
                            a summary report from Foreign Minister Rifai on his recent trip to Cairo
                            and his discussions with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
                            and Foreign Minister Riad. The basic point that emerged from the
                            discussions was the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> insistence that
                            not a single inch of Arab territory could be conceded to Israel in a
                            peace settlement.</note>
                        <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> has raised the ante again.</p>
                    <p>In that perspective, and taking into account the hijacking episode<note n="5"
                            xml:id="d224fn5">See <ref target="#d223">Document 223</ref>.</note> and
                        Soviet preoccupation in Czechoslovakia, the Phantoms should be a good signal
                        to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> to proceed at once towards a
                        settlement. It is indispensably important that the Arabs (and the Soviets)
                        understand our firm intention to support a fair and evenhanded settlement,
                        and a fair and evenhanded process of negotiation required to achieve it.
                        Miscalculation on this point could in itself produce precisely the blow up
                        we want to prevent.</p>
                    <p>On the Israeli side, I think the Phantoms make sense as well. It is very
                        likely that we shall have to commit the planes anyway in connection with the
                        military assistance bill. It is better to make the decision without
                        coercion, and as part of the process of our overall cooperation with Israel.
                        If we lose Israeli confidence, or create unnecessary suspicions, we may find
                        it increasingly difficult to influence Israel towards moderation in the
                        months ahead.<note n="6" xml:id="d224fn6">On July 31 Harold Saunders sent a

                    </p>
                    <p>The Phantoms should be a factor for moderation in another sense as well. When
                        the arms balance is precarious, Israel feels easily threatened, and tempted
                        by the idea of a preemptive strike. It is our interest to avoid another
                        blowup. With confidence in our support derived from an early decision on
                        Phantoms, the Israelis might be less trigger-happy when the next round of
                        episodes occurs.</p>
                    <p>The military situation is genuinely serious. The Arabs have too many planes,
                        and too many modern planes. Their airfields are no longer easy targets. Too
                        many of the Israeli planes are old and patched together. If a war does come,
                        it will again be in our interest for Israel to win, and to win
                        decisively.</p>
                    <p>It might conceivably be worth another round with the Soviets on the subject,
                        on a pretty blunt “Phantoms or talks-with-<persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                            >Jarring</persName>” basis. I doubt it myself, but I wouldn't object to
                        telling the Russians once more that we're tired of <gloss target="#t_UAR1"

                            target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>'s agreement. As to long range, he kept
                        reiterating <gloss target="#t_GUAR1">GUAR</gloss> acceptance of Nov 22
                        resolution in its entirety, including concept of agreed settlement, with all
                        its implications. He said this meant <gloss target="#t_GUAR1">GUAR</gloss>
                        had no intention returning to pre-June 5 situation.</p>
                    <p>6. Stating that <gloss target="#t_GUAR1">GUAR</gloss> had received text
                        Israel's “two questions” from Jordanians, he said he did not feel this
                        anything new but said <gloss target="#t_GUAR1">GUAR</gloss> would not “be
                        bashful” in responding and posing questions of its own. Riad said <gloss
                            target="#t_GUAR1">GUAR</gloss> had given <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                            >Jarring</persName> some substantive ideas of its position on free
                        passage, borders and demilitarized zones without any response from <gloss
                            target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>. Long before <gloss target="#t_GOI1"
                            >GOI</gloss>, it had also taken initiative in posing question to <gloss
                            target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> through Jarring—namely, what was Israeli
                        concept of “secure and recognized boundaries.” <gloss target="#t_GOI1"
                            >GOI</gloss> had not responded. Atherton commented that <gloss
                            target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_UARG1">UARG</gloss>
                        had each posed hardest question for other side and neither should expect
                        immediate <pb n="442" xml:id="pg_442" facs="0470"/>full and direct answer.
                        Important point was that this could provide beginning of substantive
                        engagement of parties which offered best hope of breaking present
                        impasse.</p>
                    <p>7. As to procedural impasse, Riad said Rifai had communicated to <gloss
                            target="#t_GUAR1">GUAR</gloss> view of <persName corresp="#p_BGW1"
                            >Ball</persName> that direct negots necessary at some point. Speaking
                        very carefully, Riad said <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> at this stage
                        could not take position other than opposition to direct negots. We said that
                        at this stage important thing was to get process started. We did not see how
                        direct negots at some stage could be avoided but that was not immediate
                        issue and we had some hope Israelis now more flexible this point. When
                            <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> presented his formulation
                        of “two questions” we hoped <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> would take
                        opportunity engage Israelis in substantive dialog.</p>

                        <item>Rifai responded that Jordan very much wants to see progress between
                            now and the <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss>. In fact, as far as
                            Jordan is concerned, progress must be made well before the <gloss

                            Council meeting now set for Sept 3. Jordan and the <gloss

                            to the Arab FonMins at that time. Rifai said he could speak for the
                                <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> also in stressing the
                            “eagerness” of both the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and Jordan
                            to get down to substantive issues. He again recounted his various
                            discussions of the Jordanian substantive position with Jarring. He said
                            he is not trying to be obstructive when he says that the questions put
                            to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and the points brought by

                                corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> are too general and too vague to
                            justify specific comment. We could not see what could be said in
                            response except that Jordan still wants to know what actual boundaries
                                <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> has in mind when he talks
                            about “not all but a great deal” of territory. What specifically are the
                            “certain territorial concessions” that Israel would give? He had put
                            these questions to <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> on

                        <item>In the course of reviewing Jordan's position, Rifai stated that Jordan
                            remains ready to enter into joint meeting (with <persName
                                corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> present) if it finds there are
                            substantive matters that can profitably be discussed. These would have
                            to be something more than generalities like the points that <persName
                                corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> gave to <persName corresp="#p_BGW1"
                                >Ball</persName>. Moreover, Rifai said once again that he believes
                            he would be able to show that progress in getting substantive details
                            had been achieved before the <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss>

                        <item>After further discussions along these lines, I finally asked Rifai if
                            he would authorize me to report that in commenting on <persName
                                corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> points he had said something like
                            the following which might be conveyed to Israel: The <gloss
                                target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> had appreciated Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>'s helpfulness in conveying Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName>'s points and had been
                            interested in them. The <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> welcomed the
                            implication in Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName>'s points
                            that Israel agrees in principle to withdraw from the occupied
                            territories. The <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> has already
                            requested Amb. <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> to obtain
                            from the Israeli Govt specific statements of what they would consider
                            “secure and recognized boundaries.” Jordan is frank to say it would
                            expect to go back to the June 4 boundaries. If, however, Israel has some
                            specific rectifications to propose, Jordan would be prepared to consider
                            these. It cannot consider them unless they are proposed. <pb n="445"
                                xml:id="pg_445" facs="0473"/>Jordan has already stated to <gloss

                            <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> that it would not

                            settlement and would be prepared to limit itself to minimum forces
                            needed for the preservation of public security. The GOJ, of course,
                            found Mr. <persName>Eban</persName>'s statement of the Israeli position
                            on Jerusalem unacceptable. They would like the <gloss target="#t_GOI1"
                                >GOI</gloss> to be more specific and forthcoming on Jerusalem and in

                            response if I believed that this would help to bring about more specific
                            Israeli substantive proposals to <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                                >Jarring</persName> when <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName>
                            sees him in the next few days. He said also that I should tell King

                                <persName>Hussein</persName> later in the day. After reviewing
                            “Jordan's response” once more, I told Rifai I intended to inform
                            Washington and <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss> that he had made
                            these comments on the <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName>
                            proposals and that he had stressed Jordan's hope that Israel could give
                                <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> the specifics that had
                            been promised in the last few meetings. Rifai said he had no

                                <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> had received the two
                            questions brought by <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> in the
                            form of three with the same substance. He said he did not believe the
                                <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> would be responsive to these
                            questions since they had already been forthcoming in much more detail to
                                <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>. As in previous
                            discussions I again urged Rifai to recommend to the <gloss
                                target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> that, notwithstanding their belief they
                            have already given <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>
                            substantive details, they keep the ball rolling. If necessary let them
                            restate what they have already said to <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                                >Jarring</persName> as a response to the Israeli questions. Rifai
                            seemed to buy this idea.</item>

                            <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> On the basis of this discussion, I
                            believe we have enough to go back to the Israelis with a substantive
                            reaction from Jordan. I think we could stress to the Israelis that we
                            think it is now up to them to give Jordan through <persName
                                corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> some specifics with regard to
                            what they mean by “secure and recognized boundaries” and “certain
                            non-territorial concessions.” If they could say to <persName
                                corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> that they are ready to withdraw
                            to such boundaries, this could be used as evidence of their acceptance
                            of the principle of withdrawal and would give added stimulus to
                            continuance of indirect discussions. I think it is especially
                            significant that Rifai stated that Jordan is still willing to proceed to
                            joint meetings if some substantive details can be developed before the
                                <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> meetings.<note n="4"

                            August 3, Flott reported that the Algerian Charge Khaled Khelladi called
                            on him on August 2 to discuss the crisis over the hijacked Israeli
                            airliner. Khelladi explained why Algeria had not yet released the
                            Israeli plane, noting, among other things, that Israel and Algeria were
                            formally at war. Flott responded that while international opinion
                            applauded the release of some of the passengers, Algeria was becoming an
                            accessory after the fact in a case of piracy by holding the aircraft an
                            unreasonable length of time. In the course of the conversation, Khelladi
                            said that if Israeli authorities were to liberate some Palestinian
                            prisoners of war, not as a quid pro quo but as a humanitarian gesture,
                            Algerian investigation of the case could be accelerated. (National

                            >Barbour</persName> pointed out, our concern is that this latest
                        military action will discourage the Jordanians from responding positively to
                        Jarring's efforts to get peace talks started; that early prospects for
                        getting back the El Al airplane and the 12 Israelis from Algiers have been
                        seriously undercut; and that Israel will find itself completely isolated in
                        the Security Council for taking counter action universally viewed as
                        disproportionate to the incidents which preceded it.<note n="3"

                    <p>We have instructed Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>:
                        (a) to refrain from any United States lead which would be interpreted as an
                        attempt on our part to condemn Israel; (b) to make a major effort to assure
                        that any condemnation of Israel is balanced by explicit criticism of the
                        Fatah <pb n="449" xml:id="pg_449" facs="0477"/>raids which gave rise to the
                        Israeli counter attack; (c) to call once again on both sides to accept a
                        strengthened <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> presence as a deterrent along
                        the Jordan-Israel ceasefire line; and (d) to state publicly our support for
                        an expected Israeli demand for release of the El Al airplane and its 12
                        personnel.</p>
                    <p>We have also asked Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> to
                        exercise maximum influence in discouraging a call for sanctions against
                        Israel which we expect the Jordanians to press at the outset. We are
                        reasonably confident that, while every member of the Security Council will
                        support condemnation of the Israeli air raids, a number will be unwilling to
                        support sanctions.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet strategy is to isolate the United States in the Security Council
                        and to exploit this in the Arab world by portraying United States policy as
                        one of total support for Israel. In practical terms, if our position of
                        reasonable impartiality in the area is to be maintained and if our overall
                        interests are to be protected, the United States will be required to vote
                        affirmatively, as was the case last March (enclosed),<note n="4"

                        resolution condemning Israel and which includes reference to prior
                        provocative Fatah incidents. Such a vote would help neutralize Soviet
                        efforts to exploit the situation and help to maintain our influence with
                        both sides.</p>
                    <p>Since the prior incidents which gave rise to the raid are not well
                        documented, our efforts to achieve balance in the resolution will be very
                        difficult. We can assume the Israelis will press us to make an effort to
                        avoid condemnation. We intend to assure them that we will make a substantial
                        effort. However, we would intend to make clear at the same time that U.S.
                        interests in the area require us to avoid being isolated in the Security
                        Council on this issue. An affirmative vote on such a resolution would come
                        as no great surprise to the Israelis, in light of our affirmative vote last
                        March.</p>
                    <p>We would expect that, as in the case of the Karameh raid, the Israelis will
                        begin to discount in their own public opinion the significance of a second
                        condemnatory Security Council resolution. This in turn leads us to believe,
                        for the present at least, that there would be no serious adverse domestic
                        flak if we voted affirmatively and thereby avoided being isolated.</p>
                    <p>We request that this memorandum be sent to the President for his
                            information.<note n="5" xml:id="d229fn5">There is no indication that the

                            reason to ask the Israeli Government about the contacts. The Department
                            noted that the Israelis had indicated that they intended to offer a
                            judgment as to the possibilities for progress with the Jordanians by
                            early August. The Embassy was instructed to deny all knowledge or
                            suspicion of such contacts. (Ibid.)</note>

                            third, his confidant, <persName corresp="#p_RZ1">Zaid Rifai</persName>,
                            invited me into his private office for what turned out to be a long
                            conversation. After making his usual arguments for the need of US
                            pressure on Israel to move more constructively toward a peace
                            settlement, <persName corresp="#p_RZ1">Zaid</persName> at one point
                            commented the Israelis should know that Jordan would welcome secret and
                            separate talks if Israel had something concrete to offer. He said that
                            Israel would be surprised by how receptive Jordan would be to realistic,
                            concrete proposals designed to bring about a package settlement with
                            Israel. He then volunteered that there are not now and have not been in
                            the past any contacts with Israel about specific matters of substance.
                            Referring to messages that have been brought over by people like Hikmat
                            al-Masri, <persName corresp="#p_RZ1">Zaid</persName> said, “The trouble
                            is the Israelis never get down to earth with us.”</item>

                            <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> Viewed in the gloomy aftermath of
                            Israel's air strike on August fourth, Zaid Rifai's comments might not
                            seem so significant as the day they were uttered. Nevertheless, I would
                            judge they more than likely reflect the thinking of the King, and
                            therefore should be treated seriously. Rifai's reference to the need for
                            concrete proposals from Israel underlines what has been said frequently
                            by the <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> and Hussein to recent
                            American visitors such as <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>
                            and <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName>. It reveals that if
                            concrete, specific proposals were advanced by Israel, Jordan or, rather,
                            the King would attach relatively little importance to the channel
                            through which they might be transmitted, whether from <persName
                                corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>, or through something like the

                        does not want a real peace and that one reason he refuses to face reality
                        and settle with Israel is that he still thinks he can win the arms race.

                        there is to be any progress the Israelis will have to begin talking

                        The Israelis want these mainly to cover normal attrition over the life of

                    <p>216436. 1. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SAH1">Sharaf</persName> of Jordan
                        called on Assistant Secretary Battle on August 6 and expressed his deep
                        concern that the continuation of the present trend of events would make it
                        increasingly difficult for King <persName>Hussein</persName> to justify his
                        close relationship with the United States. He said that the recent Israeli
                        air attacks had created a strong public reaction in Jordan. Almost all
                        Jordanians believed United States could prevent such attacks if we wished to
                        do so. In fact, the air raids had been carried out partially with US Skyhawk
                        aircraft which had been delivered to Israel after Israel had occupied Arab
                        territory in June 1967.</p>

                    <p>2. The Ambassador said that Jordan had accepted the November 22 resolution in
                        toto even though the resolution had included almost all of Israel's
                        objectives. Jordan had done so in light of US assurances that the <gloss
                            target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> would use its full weight to support the
                        resolution. Unfortunately the Israelis had blocked the implementation of the
                        resolution by arguing over modalities of agreement and the United States has
                        not used its influence with Israel to bring about an agreement. The Arabs
                        therefore concluded that the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> is
                        retreating from its assurances, both in respect to our support of the <gloss
                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolution as well as our earlier assurances
                        on territorial integrity for the nations of the Middle East. In addition to
                        all this, the Ambassador continued, <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> is
                        now attempting to balance a few sporadic acts of resistance carried out by
                        individual Arabs in the occupied territories with the calculated and
                        destructive air raids carried out by the armed forces of Israel in the
                        heartland of Jordan. The obvious disproportion between the provocation and
                        the response has made the US posture appear insincere to the Arab world.
                        United States actions are creating a situation in which it is increasingly
                        difficult for King <persName>Hussein</persName> to justify his relations
                        with the United States, and in fact, such ties are becoming more dangerous
                        for the King in a “concrete sense”.</p>
                    <p>3. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BLD1">Battle</persName> said that he could
                        dispute many of the specific points made by the Ambassador but this ground
                        had been covered many times. He was now more interested in hearing any ideas
                        the Ambassador might have on how the trend of events could be reversed.
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SAH1">Sharaf</persName> replied that
                        despite our protestations the US could use its leverage on Israel. We had
                        done so in 1957 and we could now withhold arms shipments. Both <persName
                            corresp="#p_DM1">Dayan</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_EL1"
                            >Eshkol</persName> have said that they do not care about the rest of the
                        world as long as the United States continued to back Israel. The US could
                        also show more balance and understanding for the Arab position in the
                        statements made by <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> leaders. Even the
                        Vice-President had recently made statements favoring the delivery of
                        Phantom-jet aircraft to Israel.</p>
                    <p>4. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BLD1">Battle</persName> pointed out that the
                        situation in 1967 was different from that in 1957. The rights and wrongs
                        were clearer in 1957 and the failure of the arrangements negotiated at that
                        time were a major reason for our present difficulties. It is also a fact
                        that many observers could see a causal relationship between Arab terrorism
                        and Israeli reprisals. Our position on both has been clearly stated and we
                        still believed that the November 22 resolution and the <persName
                            corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> mission offer the best opportunity
                        to check the present unhappy course of events. Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_SAH1">Sharaf</persName> said that he was afraid that the
                        Israeli rigidity on negotiations and their policy of armed reprisals would
                        soon make the November 22 resolution irrelevant.</p>

                    <p>5. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BLD1">Battle</persName> pointed out that
                        the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> found both the Arab and Israeli
                        positions on modalities to be unrealistic and asked why Jordan resisted the
                        stationing of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> observers along the
                        ceasefire lines. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SAH1">Sharaf</persName>
                        replied that Jordan did not trust Israel and believed that the Israelis
                        wished to convert the ceasefire line into a permanent boundary. In any
                            case,<gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> observers would not answer the
                        real problem. The real problem was how to implement the Security Council
                        resolution. The three “noes” of the Khartoum conference were a necessary
                        concession to Arab public opinion and provided the framework which made Arab
                        acceptance of the November 22 resolution possible.</p>
                    <p>6. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SAH1">Sharaf</persName> ended the
                        conversation with a plea that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> at least
                        make some gesture indicating a greater understanding of the Arab position as
                        we have already gone far down the road towards severing meaningful contact
                        with the Arab world. The United States' abstentions on the <gloss
                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Jerusalem resolutions had probably hurt US
                        prestige more in the Arab world than our arms sales to Israel.</p>

                                granted—particularly in view of their interest in opening the Suez
                                Canal. It seems doubtful that we can deflect the Soviet Union from
                                its one-sided support of the Arabs, but we should at least make an
                                effort, if for no other reason than that 100 countries will expect
                                us to do so.</item>

                        degrees. Regarding our interest, <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>
                        concludes: “We should make a study in depth to determine our position with
                        regard to the opening of the Canal. If that study should show—as it well
                        might-that our interests are best served by keeping the Canal closed—thus
                        frustrating Soviet strategic ambitions and raising the cost of Soviet
                        supplies to North Vietnam—then we should be quite tough-minded in not
                        joining in efforts to separate this issue from an overall settlement, in
                        spite of the continuing expense to our British, German and Italian friends.
                        Alternatively, if the study should show that these strategic considerations
                        are only marginally important, we might make a real effort to trade our
                        support for the reopening of the Canal for Soviet support of an acceptable
                        final settlement of the Middle Eastern problem.”</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> said it was certainly helpful
                            to have this report of Symmes talk with Rifai. Welcomed indication that
                            Rifai remains of the same disposition as in May when he expressed desire
                            to find way for Jordan and Israel to meet under <persName
                                corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>'s chairmanship. Thought this
                            willingness on Jordan's part was most important thing that has come from
                                <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> Mission. <persName
                                corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> thought there should be no further
                            American approach to Jordan until he, <persName corresp="#p_EA1"
                                >Eban</persName>, had seen <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                                >Jarring</persName>. He would ask <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                                >Jarring</persName> to tell Rifai that if the Jordanians find a way
                            to meet with the Israelis under <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                                >Jarring</persName>'s chairmanship they would then not any longer
                            hear generalities about Israel's position but specifics. Whether <gloss
                                target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> could give them anything more specific
                            before such a meeting, however, would depend. If a meeting such as Rifai
                            envisaged with <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> present
                            could be arranged, then the speed of progress would increase by
                            geometric proportions, so speedily as to bear no relation to the pace of
                            progress up to now. He would ask <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                                >Jarring</persName> to tell Jordanians, however, <pb n="457"

                                target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> views it must be done in a situation in

                            <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> went on to say that the
                            current situation on the frontier might be said to offer great obstacles
                            to negotiations. Certainly it was hard to try to make peace with a
                            country which maintains anti-ceasefire organizations on its territory.
                            Some members of <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> say that Jordan
                            should be required to take strong action against El Fatah before Israel
                            would be willing to negotiate, but the <gloss target="#t_GOI1"
                                >GOI</gloss> is ready to proceed without this. Nevertheless,
                            relationship of <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> to El Fatah is an
                            important element. One alternative would be to say that the local
                            security situation is an obstacle which must prevent negotiations from
                            the point of view of both sides, but another, which he thought more
                            realistic, would be to disassociate the two. Noted Jordan had not yet
                            said that security situation would influence peace moves.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>His feeling, <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> said, was that
                            if Israelis got around a table with Jordanians there would be a great
                            deterrent on both sides against security situations which might
                            adversely affect negotiations and both countries would take pains to
                            avoid them. Said he would do everything to get <persName
                                corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> to work for a meeting at <gloss
                                target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> because this would be the first time
                            since <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>'s appointment for
                            the Foreign Ministers to be together under one roof. The speed of
                            liaison would be immensely improved, with <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                                >Jarring</persName> able to go from room to room to make meeting
                            arrangements rather than have to fly from country to country with
                            attendant delays. Whatever <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>
                            does for next month to keep pot boiling will be fine, but his aim should
                            be for a meeting at <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>.</item>

                                >Eban</persName> said he understood <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                                >Jarring</persName> had not officially transmitted his questions
                            since he found <persName corresp="#p_KMAE1">El Kony</persName>
                            frustrating to deal with and preferred to keep questions for direct talk
                            with Riad. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> said <gloss
                                target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> estimates Egypt in state of ideological
                            immobility. Result of <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>'s questions
                            would not be to make progress towards peace but to show who is
                            responsible for lack of progress. If the primary goal cannot be attained
                            at least the secondary one can. As long as the <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                                >UAR</gloss>-Jordan ideological gap remains, with one refusing all
                            of the things to which the other agrees, he did not see how progress
                            could be made.</item>
                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>I told <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> we certainly agreed
                            that next step is between him and <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                                >Jarring</persName>. Since he had mentioned question of El Fatah, I
                            had to say again that we deplore both El Fatah and <gloss
                                target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> moves, and regard <gloss
                                target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> response as unfortunate. I added for
                            myself that I was sorry to see that Israel found no response to
                            infiltrators but offensive military force on a scale all out of
                            proportion to the infiltration. <persName corresp="#p_EA1"
                                >Eban</persName> replied that it was important to meet infiltrators
                            on the ground but also important to pursue them to their home bases.
                            Failure is what influences them most, and they will be emboldened if
                            they can maintain their bases with immunity on the acquiescence of
                                <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss>. Even if it could not entirely
                            prevent <pb n="458" xml:id="pg_458" facs="0486"/>Fatah operations,
                                <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> could at least create conditions
                            to make them hard.</item>
                        <label>7.</label>
                        <item>I told <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> that <gloss
                                target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> puts enormous efforts into offensive
                            military tactics. I wondered if they were prepared to take the same sort
                            of risks in the search for peace. <persName corresp="#p_EA1"
                                >Eban</persName> replied that the parallel was not valid because
                            their efforts on the peace front get no reactions from the other
                            side.</item>
                        <label>8.</label>
                        <item>I believe conversation gave <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName>
                            a good understanding of how strongly we feel that opening towards
                            substantive talks represented by Rifai's comments should not be lost. At
                            same time, basic situation seems to remain that Jordan wants specific
                            proposals before it will sit down with <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                                >Jarring</persName> and Israelis, while Israelis say they cannot get
                            down to specifics until they are actually sitting around a table with
                                <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> and <gloss
                                target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss>. In spite of this difference, I think
                            there is room for <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> to
                            maneuver and to seek to extract a little from each side to meet the
                            needs of the other with the hope that, as <persName corresp="#p_EA1"
                                >Eban</persName> says, the final steps to bring them together can be

                        Secretary hopes to discuss this with the President by phone Thursday morning
                        at the President's convenience.</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>“1. The attached resolution is substantially the same as that adopted
                            by the Security Council in March following the Israeli raid on Karameh.
                            This is the case despite the fact that whereas there were general and
                            well-documented prior incidents which provoked the Karameh raid, the
                            same cannot be said for the present situation. The incidents that
                            preceded the Israeli air raid on Salt were of a relatively minor
                            character which could be expected in a situation where there is military
                            occupation of territory. Tekoah (Israel) has made no real case in the
                            Security Council concerning the prior provocations to this latest raid,
                            and we nevertheless have succeeded in injecting balance in the
                            resolution even though the Israelis have made a weak case. The fact of
                            the matter is that this latest Israeli raid was a preventive raid rather
                            than one that was sparked by any prior serious incident. Moreover, it is
                            all the more embarrassing to us that evidence indicates that the
                            Skyhawks we gave to Israel were involved.</item>
                        <item>2. We have worked very hard behind the scenes in order to make the
                            text more balanced than in any of its earlier forms. We have succeeded
                            in two principal ways: (A) the sponsors, pursuant to our pressure, have
                            eliminated any language which might form the basis for future sanctions
                            against Israel; and (B) while the text condemns the Israeli counter
                            raid, it also makes explicit reference to the prior acts of
                            terrorism.</item>
                        <item>3. Friendly members of the Security Council, after concerted and
                            extensive efforts on our part (<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>,
                            Canada, Denmark, Brazil and Paraguay) have helped us achieve this
                            result. They have concluded, as we have, that this is as well as we can
                            do on any text. They are prepared to support the text, and we would be
                            isolated if we were to stand out by abstaining. This would have adverse
                            effects on our overall position in the area and give the Soviets an
                            opportunity to exploit the situation to their advantage.</item>
                        <item>4. A U.S. abstention would encourage the Israelis to feel that there
                            were no restraints regarding similar future raids and that it could
                            disregard entirely the views of the Security Council.</item>
                        <item>5. Last March Israel put the best face on the Security Council
                            resolution by stressing that both the prior terrorist raids and the
                            Israeli counter action were criticized by the Security Council. They
                            discounted its importance in Israeli public opinion, and we can expect
                            the Israelis to play it essentially the same way this time. Our informal
                            discussions with the Israelis indicate they expect condemnation and a
                            resolution similar to the one adopted last March, and that this result
                            they would not find greatly disturbing.</item>
                        <item>6. We do not expect the adoption of this resolution to have any
                            appreciable effect here at home. We have had no expressions of concern
                                <pb n="461" xml:id="pg_461" facs="0489"/>from the Jewish community,
                            and there has been little interest in our press in the <gloss
                                target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> proceedings. The editorials on the latest
                            incident in our papers have been balanced and have linked the
                            provocations with the counter action, so that I do not anticipate any
                            major press problem.</item>
                        <item>7. Our affirmative vote would be coupled with a statement by <persName
                                corresp="#p_BGW1">George Ball</persName> in the Council which would
                            stress that the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> resolution applies
                            both to the prior terrorist raids as well as to Israeli counter action.
                            George has already made such a speech in the Security Council, but it
                            would be worth repeating.</item>

                            discussing the possibility of direct contacts between Israel and Jordan,
                                <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> indicated that Jordan
                            could not expect to receive any further clarification of Israeli
                            territorial assurances without engaging in direct talks. Sisco noted
                            that this was at variance with the impression he and <persName

                        <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>'s understanding was that the
                        Israelis would exchange real substance through <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                            >Jarring</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> now says
                        the generalities he's passed are all the Jordanians are going to get, at
                        least through <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>, until they meet
                        directly. Nor did <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> give <persName
                            corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> anything encouraging to take to
                        Cairo, as we suggested he do.</p>
                    <p>Joe Sisco has already reacted, and State has instructed <persName
                            corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BW1"
                            >Barbour</persName> to react similarly. This is a fair start, but I
                        think we ought to arrange a small explosion. If we let them get away with
                        this without more than a passing comment, we can write off right now most of
                        the progress <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> achieved.</p>
                    <p>I am trying to stir State to sharpen and broaden its expression of dismay so
                        the Israelis will get the point. Luke will do so with <persName
                            corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> and will suggest Nick Katzenbach
                        follow suit. He also agrees that we should include this theme in the
                        President's reply to <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName>, but
                        that's still a few days off. If Eppie were here, I'd suggest you call him,
                        but I guess we've lost that channel for the moment. Anyway, you can keep
                        this theme in the back of your mind-the Israelis are slipping away from the
                        position they took with <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>You asked what is going on in Syria. Although much of our information comes
                        from poor sources, we can see the general outlines. What we can't judge is
                        the relative strength of the contending groups. The people in Damascus could
                        be over-reacting to a largely imaginary threat, or they could be one step
                        from defeat.</p>
                    <p>The coup in Iraq a month ago, which brought a right-wing Baath government to
                        power, encouraged the exiled Syrian Baathists in Beirut and frightened the
                        radical Baath rulers in Damascus. Damascus is taking <pb n="464"
                            xml:id="pg_464" facs="0492"/>the reports of plotting in Baghdad and
                        Beirut seriously. We know that there is plotting, but we don't know where it
                        will lead or how much support the plotters will get from Iraq.</p>
                    <p>To counter the threat, Damascus has cracked down—we aren't sure how much—on
                        potential opponents in Syria. One result has been an increase in suspicion
                        within the government and a decrease in domestic support.</p>
                    <p>The crackdown—rather than coup plotting—was probably the reason the former
                        Army Chief of Staff fled to Beirut, and this could also be the reason the
                        Syrian pilots flew to Israel but it is more likely that they just got
                        lost.</p>
                    <p>Because most of the plotters are in Beirut, the Syrians have tried to put
                        pressure on Lebanon. Their main effort was a transit tax which hurt the
                        Lebanese, but also hurt the Jordanians, Saudis and Kuwaitis. The major
                        result so far has been an increase in Syria's isolation in the Arab
                        world.</p>
                    <p>The Syrian rulers have never been popular, but most Syrians don't think the
                        alternatives to the present regime are much better. If the exiles try to
                        seize power, they will find neither popular support nor popular opposition.
                        The only question is whether they are strong enough to seize key positions
                        in the government. The answer to the question is in Baghdad and Damascus.
                        Our sources are in Beirut and Amman. If the exiles win, Syria is likely to
                        be less radical, but it would still be among the Arab extremists.</p>
                    <p>Our main concern in all this is the effect on Jordan. There are indications
                        that the plotters hope to overthrow Hussein as well as the Syrians. The
                        Jordanians believe that Hussein is becoming increasingly vulnerable, and
                        that our “pro-Israeli” policies contribute to radical strength.</p>

                            questions represents a good start, but it must be built upon, not only
                            with additional questions but further and fuller explanations by all

                        <item>We think time has long passed for any of the parties to stick to
                            doctrinal rigidities. We hope that <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                            will respond fully and constructively to questions <persName

                            parties, we believe it would promote progress if all parties, including
                                <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, could begin to clarify their
                            positions in more specific terms re key elements of Security Council
                            resolution.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>For example, a positive reply by <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                            to question of whether it prepared in context of a peace settlement to
                            put a complete end to state of belligerency with State of Israel would
                            be helpful. At best, we would like <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                            to respond with a categoric “yes,” coupling such affirmative reply with
                            indication of willingness to embody such an obligation in binding
                            commitment with Israel not with some third party as <gloss
                                target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>. <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>
                            endorsement of any agreement would obviously be very useful, but it is
                            not a feasible substitute for a binding undertaking between principal
                            parties. <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> could be reminded that when
                            they say they accept <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_Res1">Res</gloss> of Nov. 22 from A to Z as a package,
                            para. 3 calls for “agreement.”</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>A further example can be cited re second question: recognition of
                            political independence, territorial sovereignty and integrity of Israel.
                            Again we feel that if in fact <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> is
                            interested in a fundamental settlement then it must begin to indicate
                            now that it is willing to consider a binding commitment between <gloss
                                target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                            >UAR</gloss>. This would be clearest indication that <gloss
                                target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> had in fact adopted a live-and-let-live
                            policy, and is willing work out a modus vivendi with Israel. Is <gloss
                                target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> ready for this? Statement on its part
                            that “it accepts <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> resolution of
                            November 1967” are useful, but have become part of doctrinal rigidity
                            which has contributed to impasse. What is required is indication of
                                <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> willingness to enter into
                            binding understanding with <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> on
                            crucial point of this kind, as required by para. 3.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>Similarly, distinction which <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> has
                            been trying to make between freedom of passage of Israeli cargoes and
                            Israeli flag ships strikes us as unrealistic and casts doubt on <gloss

                        <item>In short, we feel you ought to smoke out Riad on specifics. We suspect
                            you will not get very far. We recognize <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                                >UAR</gloss> has been conveying piece-meal reactions to specific
                            points in resolution which in our judgment have been designed largely to
                            improve <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> position tactically and
                            publicly. Answers or lack of answers or partial answers by <gloss
                                target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> will help clarify whether their
                            reaction is primarily tactical for public relations purposes or whether
                            in fact they want to come to grips with the elements of a fundamental

                                August 12 Pace, citing “well-informed Arab diplomats,” reported that
                                the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> was prepared to accept a
                                settlement that included internationalizing the Gaza strip, waiving

                                demilitarizing the Sinai peninsula. In another article on August 15,
                                Pace cited “highly placed Western diplomats” as revealing that the

                                >Ball</persName> luncheon with Gohar (August 13), we inquired
                            whether there was anything to August 12 article and got only quick
                            denials from all three <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                            representatives present at the luncheon. We feel you ought to get across
                            to Riad our feeling that positions adopted by <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                                >UAR</gloss> to date have been primarily for public relations
                            purposes rather than a serious attempt to face realities of a
                            settlement. We say this not in sense of trying to make a judgment as to
                            which of the parties is responsible because there has been plenty of
                            rigidity on both sides. But we feel there is genuine opportunity to test
                            real intentions of parties, and that it is a matter of high urgency to
                            prepare the way for constructive exchanges among Fonmins in New
                            York.</item>

                        <item>We note also that <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> has been very
                            careful in avoiding any indication as to whether Foreign Minister Riad
                            intends to be present in opening days of the General Assembly. This too,
                            in our judgment, will be a test. Rifai of Jordan obviously wants to go
                            there, but we detected caution on part of <gloss target="#t_GOJ1"
                                >GOJ</gloss> in absence of knowing what <gloss target="#t_UAR1"

                        <label>8.</label>
                        <item>With reference to <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> statements of
                            “acceptance of the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> resolution” and its

                            is all three have accepted resolution, but each has expressed its
                            acceptance with its own reservations. <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                                >UAR</gloss>, for example, has accepted <gloss target="#t_SC1"
                                >SC</gloss> resolution, but it does not draw attention to fact that
                            acceptance is subject to reservation that it interprets <gloss

                            forces to pre-June lines. Jordan has probably been most categoric in
                            acceptance of resolution, though it too has expressed its reservations.
                            And Israel is also on record as accepting resolution within context of
                            its own reservations. (Tekoah's May 1 <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>

                            willingness to explore substance indirectly, and this was reflected in
                            questions posed to <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and Israeli ideas

                            understood clearly, though there was no time period put on it, that
                            indirect process would be pursued seriously in hopes that it might set
                            stage for serious explorations in the opening days of the General
                            Assembly, including possibility of joint meetings, most likely in
                            presence of <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>. We have
                            expressed concern to Israelis here and in New York that reports of
                                <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName>'s Aug 9 conversation with
                                <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> indicate a less
                            flexible posture than we were led to believe existed. We want to be
                            specific in this regard. Reports are that <persName corresp="#p_EA1"
                                >Eban</persName> told <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>
                            that while Israel remained flexible, “Jordan cannot have specific
                            clarification of Israel's intentions without some kind of direct
                            contacts.” (This is precisely as Argov reported it to us here, see State
                                220328.)<note n="4" xml:id="d240fn4">See <ref target="#d237fn2"

                            take view it unwilling to be more specific unless there is direct

                                >Eban</persName> to keep substantive dialogue going by being
                            directly responsive to Jordanian request for more specificity. We
                            realize this might entail difficult decisions on which Israeli Cabinet
                            divided. But we are reaching watershed, and parties must begin to face
                            up to realities. We felt ideas <persName corresp="#p_BGW1"

                            Rifai's response has certainly a number of elements which are
                            unacceptable to Israelis, nevertheless <gloss target="#t_GOJ1"
                                >GOJ</gloss> has said explicitly that it is willing to get together

                        differentiation between Israel cargoes and flag not understandable. If
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> meant what it said re readiness
                        terminate state belligerency with Israel, then there no basis for any kind
                        of discrimination against Israel flag. Either you had belligerency or you
                        didn't. It didn't come in packages of varying size. <persName
                            corresp="#p_RM2">Mohamed</persName> said agreement which <gloss
                            target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> envisaged would culminate in total
                        implementation of <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> res. Same agreement
                        which opened Canal to Israel cargoes “as a first step” would also spell out
                        circumstances in which state of belligerency would be terminated and Canal
                        opened to Israel flag.</p>
                    <p>7. I mentioned denial of <persName corresp="#p_KMAE1">Kony</persName>, Gohar,

                        leave this to <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> to determine.
                            <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> felt he had acceptance of
                        all three to first two paragraphs of his March-May formula.</p>
                    <p>9. When I talked about possible <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> readiness
                        tell <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> that it willing to try to

                            >Mohamed</persName> said words “with Israel” were the ones that created
                        the problem. This recalled Washington conversations in which <gloss

                        to “sign on the dotted line.” He reverted to proposition that <gloss

                            <p>The <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> is surprised by the
                                assumption expressed by US officers that there has been any change
                                in the position which he and his colleagues outlined to <gloss
                                    target="#t_Amb1">Amb</gloss>
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> and Asst Secty <persName
                                    corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> in Jerusalem. There is not
                                the slightest justification or foundation for this assumption. In
                                his conversation with <gloss target="#t_Amb1">Amb</gloss>
                                <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> in London on Aug 9 Mr.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> gave an account of
                                Israel's views on the <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>
                                Mission in terms which were identical verbatim with those expressed
                                to <gloss target="#t_Amb1">Amb</gloss>
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> in Jerusalem. Indeed he
                                read the relevant part of the Protocol of the Jerusalem talks. It is
                                disturbing that a totally inaccurate view about a change of position
                                should have been propagated within the US Administration, and even
                                outside.</p>
                            <p>Israel's position remains precisely as stated to <gloss
                                    target="#t_Amb1">Amb</gloss>
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> and Asst Secty <persName
                                    corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName>. We do not believe that
                                binding engagements will be reached and signed on the basis of
                                obstruction and refusal to meet. On the other hand our belief in the
                                principle of normal negotiation does not exclude the preliminary
                                exchange of views and clarifications through <persName
                                    corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> and otherwise of some of the
                                main principles involved in the establishment of peace. Thus we have
                                tried to initiate a dialogue with the <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                                    >UAR</gloss> on the juridical and political implications of the
                                term “just and lasting peace.” We shall try to maintain this
                                dialogue and to avoid a diplomatic vacuum. This principle applied to
                                Jordan as well. We have noted Jordan's reported willingness to hold
                                joint meetings with Israel in <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                                    >Jarring</persName>'s presence. On the other hand Jordan wishes
                                to learn Israel's approach to the problem of “secure and recognized
                                    <pb n="473" xml:id="pg_473" facs="0501"/>boundary.” As was said

                                <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> we are ready to

                                ascertained that these opportunities have not been affected by
                                recent frontier clashes. It is however essential that the utmost
                                discretion be maintained on Israel's efforts to diversify its
                                methods of informal communication and that what was said to <gloss
                                    target="#t_Amb1">Amb</gloss>
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> be taken on trust.
                                Israel did not share the view expressed in April that the <persName
                                    corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> Mission was in danger of
                                early liquidation and we do not now believe it impossible to carry
                                the mission on to the <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> when
                                greater possibilities of meaningful communication may present

                            reported that King <persName>Hussein</persName> and his advisers had

                            likelihood that any acquisition of PSF equipment or commodities would be

                            this stage discussions should be limited to Jordanian requirements under

                        <item>Other Internal Defense Assistance. Following represents our current
                            thinking. We agree that most immediate threats to <gloss
                                target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> are popular rioting and fedayeen
                            action. In controlling these threats additional equipment and manpower
                            may be less important than improved training and deployment of personnel
                            and equipment assets now available to regime. We also believe that it is
                            not unreasonable to assume that in certain circumstances the regime may
                            be required to reduce its static border defenses in order to deal with
                            internal disturbances. The forces available for internal security cited
                            in reftel, twelve battalions or equivalent totaling over 6,000 men,
                            should represent an effective security force without additional
                            increases. Should these not prove adequate in <pb n="475"
                                xml:id="pg_475" facs="0503"/>any given situation, redeployment of
                            other forces would be normal and expected next step. We assume that some
                            of equipment we now delivering (e.g. APCs) will be made available for
                            internal security forces.</item>

                        <item>On third I told King <persName>Hussein</persName> the Embassy had been
                            authorized to engage in working level substantive discussions of
                            Jordan's internal security problem. I therefore wanted to have a general
                            discussion with him before our working levels got into details. I wanted
                            him to know we regard the Fedayeen problem as a primary cause of
                            incidents between Jordan and Israel. These incidents place strains on
                            US-Jordanian relations, and they create an impossible climate for
                            progress toward a peaceful settlement. Perhaps even more important, the
                            Fedayeen pose a real threat to the integrity of the Jordanian regime
                            itself. Beyond that, the Fedayeen groups almost inevitably could be
                            counted on to create disorder when and if some tangible progress toward
                            a peaceful settlement was achieved and publicized. We therefore want to
                            do all we can to help Jordan deal effectively with the Fedayeen problem
                            both in the short and long term. Our discussions with his people would
                            be for the primary purpose of determining Jordan's requirements. I had
                            to make clear I was not promising grant aid. In principle, we would
                            expect Jordan to purchase material it needed. We would determine how we
                            could best assist Jordan's own internal defense efforts. I added that I
                            assumed he would have no objection if I kept the British Ambassador
                            generally informed of our efforts. I asked the King what general
                            strategy he had in mind especially with regard to the timing of his
                            efforts to deal with the Fedayeen problem.</item>

                                seek the approval of the Arab League Council for Jordanian efforts
                                to control the Fedayeen. In telegram 6368, August 28, Symmes
                                reported that Prince Mohammad, acting as Viceroy in his father's
                                absence from the country, had told him that Jordan planned to seek
                                the support of other Arab countries in its efforts to control the
                                Fedayeen. Telegram 6426, August 31, reported on Symmes' meeting with
                                Foreign Minister Rifai prior to Rifai's departure for the Arab
                                League Council meeting in Cairo. Symmes, encouraged Rifai to pursue

                            Rifai's tactics in the Arab League Council meeting. (He mentioned

                            has now been formalized, was from his standpoint important as a means of
                            asserting a degree of control over Fedayeen activities in Syria and
                            Iraq.) See NJA-7040.<note n="5" xml:id="d244fn5">Not found.</note>

                        <item>The King said he is confident that the army is loyal to him and, if
                            required, would be able to deal with the Fedayeen. He has issued new
                            orders to insure that army units take even stricter measures to control
                            Fedayeen irregular activities in the Beisan area. In his view the
                            Israelis could not expect perfection from him and his forces any more
                            than they were able to get it from their own in suppressing Fedayeen
                            activities. (I stressed to him during this part of our conversation that
                            we see Fedayeen activity against civilian settlements in the Beisan area
                            as the chief irritant to the Israelis and that I could not emphasize too
                            much our hope that the Jordan army would exert greater control over the
                            Fedayeen in this region. I commented that the Israelis seemed able
                            pretty well to defend themselves in other parts of the ceasefire line.
                            The vicious circle could be broken if some means could be found to
                            prevent or significantly to diminish the Fedayeen attacks on Israeli
                            civilians across the old ADL. We do not question the need to improve
                            public security capability for coping with the Fedayeen, but on the old
                            ADL front the problem seemed to be the army's responsibility. The King

                        <item>The King said he wanted to make it clear that his plans for improving
                            the capability of dealing with the Fedayeen and internal disorder
                            generally were based on public security forces rather than the <pb
                                n="477" xml:id="pg_477" facs="0505"/>army for specific reasons that
                            he proceeded to explain. Psychologically speaking, it was impossible for
                            him to give the army an internal security mission when troubles were
                            taking place along the frontier, the Israelis remained in occupation of
                            the West Bank, and generally hostile Israel-Arab confrontation existed.
                            The presence of Iraqi troops in Jordan and the situation in Syria also
                            made it important for him not to divert the army from its primary
                            mission of defense from outside aggression. While he recognized that if
                            Fedayeen incidents diminished there would be less threat from Israel,
                            the psychological difficulties he had described would remain for some
                            time to come. Therefore, he must rely on public security forces as
                            distinguished from military forces in order to deal with the Fedayeen
                            and other internal security problems. In the event of <gloss
                                target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss>'s moving toward a peaceful settlement
                            with Israel, the Fedayeen would probably seek to promote internal
                            disturbances in protest. Mobile Bedouin police forces had proved
                            themselves over the years the best means of dealing with this kind of
                            security problem. He said he would like for Embassy officials to discuss
                            the requirements with General Ma'an Abu Nuwar and other officials under
                            Abu Nuwar. He stressed, however, that the mobile Bedouin forces would be
                            separate from the police although under Abu Nuwar's over-all
                            control.</item>

                        <item>With regard to timing, the King says he does not anticipate an
                            immediate confrontation with the Fedayeen. On the other hand, he must be
                            prepared to move if his tactics at any moment should provoke outright
                            confrontation. The optimum solution, in his eyes, would be agreement
                            from the other Arabs to order all Fedayeen forces supported from the
                            outside to place themselves under his control. This would enable him to
                            clamp down on Fedayeen activities, assuming that there could be some
                            progress toward a peaceful settlement. In the latter circumstance, he
                            would be able to deal effectively with any Fedayeen confrontation with
                            his control measures and would have the blessing of the other Arab
                            countries. He regards it as unlikely, however, that the other Arabs will
                            agree at this stage to this kind of control. Depending on how <gloss

                            his asserting control over the Fedayeen in Jordan. He anticipates a real
                            problem with Saudi Arabia. He observed that the Saudis at present are
                            subsidizing Fatah on condition they not coordinate with any Arab govt,
                            including Jordan.</item>

                        <p>The Soviet Government as heretofore considers its contribution to the
                            achievement of a Middle East settlement to be one of its principal
                            foreign policy tasks. This unchanging and consistent course of ours is
                            well known to the Government of the USA. It finds its concrete
                            expression in our active support of the just cause of the Arab states
                            striving to liquidate the consequences of Israeli aggression by
                            peaceful, political means.</p>
                        <p>In Moscow there is a conviction that a Middle East settlement does not
                            concern the countries of this region only. Undoubtedly the great powers
                            are also interested in this settlement. The persistence of tension in
                            the Middle East and the continued illegal occupation by Israel of
                            indigenous Arab terrorists cannot fail to cause concern to the Soviet
                            Government, since such a situation threatens the general peace.</p>
                        <p>At the same time it is impossible to deny the obvious fact that while the
                            Arab states recognize the Security Council resolution of November 22,
                            1967 and are prepared to seek ways for a political settlement in the
                            Middle East on the basis of that resolution, Israel stubbornly refuses
                            to recognize it, demanding direct negotiations with the Arab countries,
                            which is clearly unrealistic under present circumstances.</p>
                        <p>On the basis of contacts with the governments of the Arab states, above
                            all that of the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, it appears to us
                            that now it is already possible to speak of the presence of concrete
                            considerations of the Arab states regarding the content of a possible
                            plan and time-table for a Middle East settlement.</p>
                        <p>If we were to summarize the thoughts about the content of such a plan and
                            timetable which were expressed at different times by <pb n="480"

                                    the Suez Canal, as well as of the status of Jerusalem.</item>

                        <p>It is our deep conviction that such a plan and timetable is of important
                            practical significance as a suitable basis for further steps in reaching
                            a settlement. This plan and timetable is sufficiently realistic and
                            specific; in the event of its implementation it would not in any way
                            infringe upon the prestige or interests of any party drawn into the
                            conflict. It is also very important that this plan completely
                            corresponds to the provisions of the unanimously adopted Security
                            Council resolution of November 22, 1967, and that the implementation of
                            each of its stages inevitably leads to the implementation of the next
                            one.</p>
                        <p>This interrelationship and interdependence, it seems to us, stems from
                            the meaning of the resolution of November 22.</p>
                        <p>Finally, such a plan and timetable will to some degree apparently be able
                            to facilitate the mission of the special representative of the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Secretary General, <persName

                            governments of our countries.</p>
                        <p>In this connection we should like to note that against the background of
                            concrete proposals and the sufficiently clear position of the Arabs on
                            the problems of a Middle East settlement, the position of the Government
                            of Israel does not indicate that it has any concrete proposals for
                            reaching a Middle East settlement, but, on the contrary, being sure of
                            the support of the Government of the USA, Israel persists in its
                            negative and deliberately obstructionist position, actually ignores the
                            decisions of the General Assembly and of the Security Council of the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, tries to consolidate for itself
                            the annexed Arab territories and does nothing to lessen the tensions in
                            the Middle East. The time has come to put an end to this position of the
                            ruling circles of Israel.</p>

                        <p>The Soviet Government expresses the hope that the Government of the USA
                            will carefully review the foregoing considerations and during the course
                            of future consultations will express its opinions concerning steps,
                            which, in its view, must be taken for the quickest possible settlement
                            of the Middle East problem. The Soviet Government expresses its
                            readiness to conduct on this question consultations between

                    </list>
                    <p>No one is prepared to recommend that the President release the Phantoms to
                        Israel now. Israel's need is not significantly more urgent than it was in
                        January, and the Israelis have shown little flexibility in moving toward a
                        political settlement despite our steady low-key urging. Nevertheless there's
                        general recognition that Israel will need some supersonics in the next
                        year.</p>
                    <p>There is sharp disagreement over how much we could expect to get for the
                        Phantoms if we did go ahead now. Those who most vigorously oppose releasing
                        the planes feel we should ask the highest price—signing the <gloss
                            target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> and renouncing surface-to-surface
                        missiles—and hold out for it. Others believe the best we can try for are
                        some marginal tactical shifts in Israel's position on negotiations with the
                        Arabs. They remember how in 1965 we had to give up our efforts to trade the
                        Skyhawks for a promise not to go nuclear and feel that Israel is just as
                        unlikely today to trade for Phantoms any part of the position it won in the
                        Six Day War.</p>
                    <p>In fact, the prevailing view in State is not to bargain directly with the
                        planes at all. You'll recall that this was Eppie Evron's advice too—assure
                        Israel's basic security and then tell them what we'd like them <pb n="483"

                    </p>
                    <p>The President expressed pleasure at the opportunity to meet with Deputy Prime
                        Minister <persName corresp="#p_AY1">Allon</persName>. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_AY1">Allon</persName> said that he was very grateful for an
                        opportunity to call upon the President and to bring him the very warm
                        regards of Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName>. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName> had enjoyed greatly his
                        visit to the <gloss target="#t_LBJ1">LBJ</gloss> ranch in January, and he
                        “still carried hope that something would come from that meeting.”</p>
                    <p>The President said that he, too, had found the talks useful. He said that he
                        had great faith in the people of Israel, and he had little doubt that the
                        Israelis would be able to survive their current difficulties and with flying
                        colors.</p>
                    <p>The President asked Mr. <persName>Rostow</persName> to summarize the talks
                        that had gone on prior to the time the President was able to receive us.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Rostow</persName> said that the group had been discussing
                        various problems in the few minutes before coming into the President's
                        office. Mr. <persName>Rostow</persName> said that it had been agreed that
                        Jerusalem was perhaps the key problem. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AY1"
                            >Allon</persName> had said that some role for the Arabs in Jerusalem
                        could be negotiated with access guaranteed. There could be <pb n="485"
                            xml:id="pg_485" facs="0513"/>no change, however, in the civil and
                        sovereign status for Jerusalem. No government in Israel could survive such a
                        change. In fact, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AY1">Allon</persName> had said
                        that if any government attempted to, it might even bring civil war in
                        Israel. There had been a brief discussion of the <persName corresp="#p_AY1"
                            >Allon</persName> plan for defensive enclaves and a consideration of the
                        security problems the Israelis faced. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AY1"
                            >Allon</persName> had stressed the need now for Phantoms. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_AY1">Allon</persName> considered that the Phantoms were
                        necessary to show the Arabs that they could not win in the event of another
                        round.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AY1">Allon</persName> then remarked that Mr.
                            <persName>Rostow</persName>'s summary was a fair one, but he would like
                        to add a few points. The problem today is not how to secure victory. It is
                        how to prevent another war. The supply of U.S. Phantoms to Israel would be a
                        stabilizing factor with both the Arabs and with the Russians whose presence
                        in the area is increasing.</p>
                    <p>The trouble along the Suez is serious,<note n="3" xml:id="d247fn3">An
                            incident that began on September 8 when an Israeli Army unit detonated
                            an anti-vehicle mine discovered on the east bank of the Suez Canal 10
                            kilometers north of Port Tawfiq escalated quickly into an exchange of
                            small arms fire across the Canal, followed by an exchange of artillery
                            fire that spread across a front from Port Tawfiq to El Kantara. (USDAO
                            telegram 1599 from Tel Aviv, September 8; ibid., Country File, Israel,
                            Vol. X, Cables and Memos, 6/68-11/68)</note> but Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_AY1">Allon</persName> did not believe the Arabs would go to
                        war unless they thought they could win. After the Czechoslovakia affair
                        where the West had been incapable of responding, agreement to supply
                        Phantoms might be a helpful reply to the Soviets. Once the Arabs realize
                        that they cannot win a war, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AY1">Allon</persName>
                        believes that they will reconcile themselves to the existence of Israel.</p>
                    <p>The President told Mr. <persName>Rostow</persName> to talk to Secretary
                        Clifford and to get his comments on the current situation. The President
                        said that he would make the decision on Phantoms, but he was not sure
                        whether that decision would be made before or after elections. He had
                        already taken action to put the U.S. in a position to act without any loss
                        of time in excess of the time that would have been required if the decision
                        had been made in January. However, the U.S. wants to try to find a road to
                        peace. We do not want to be charged with inciting another war. The U.S. will
                        be cooperative in any efforts the Israelis are able to make toward
                        peace.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AY1">Allon</persName> recalled that Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> was told that the Israelis
                        would work with <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> or, for that
                        matter, with others. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AY1">Allon</persName>
                        believes, however, that the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> considers
                        that it can risk more than before-not full war perhaps but greater risks
                        without bringing about full war. The Arabs frequently do not act logically,
                        and it was sometimes difficult to anticipate what their illogical acts would
                        be.</p>
                    <p>The Russians must get tired of getting their supplies smashed and will one
                        day perhaps want to slow down the flow of arms to the area. <pb n="486"
                            xml:id="pg_486" facs="0514"/>The Government of Israel is an important
                        factor in the Middle East, and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AY1"
                            >Allon</persName> hopes that the U.S. is aware of its importance.</p>
                    <p>When Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName> left the U.S., he had
                        the feeling that his request for Phantoms would be favorably considered. The
                        Czechoslovakia situation and <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> actions on
                        the Canal are both factors to be considered carefully. That the <gloss
                            target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> acted on the Canal after the Czech incident
                        is a very important fact. The <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> might well
                        consider that it has a greater freedom of action. Its actions indicate a
                        threat of continued terrorism.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AY1">Allon</persName> continued that he had read
                        many statements and heard many speeches in the U.S. campaign. A statement by
                        the President on the F-4's would, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AY1"
                            >Allon</persName> thought, be better than an argument between
                        candidates. Arabs respect firm policies. France's position in the area is
                        weaker than it used to be, for example. The world should know that the U.S.
                        is on the side of Israel, and an announcement on Phantoms would be great

                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CCM1">Clifford</persName> noted that both of
                        these presidential candidates have been talking about the request of Israel
                        for military equipment. He wanted to know if we have in the recent weeks a
                        request for standard equipment from Israel. He said both candidates talked
                        about it yesterday and what's the status of the situation?</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said the President might
                        want to comment on that.</p>
                    <p>The President said: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“Yes. In the last five minutes—there is a constant request from
                                Israel. Vice President NIXON said day before yesterday he was going
                                to give them jet planes. Well, we're giving them jet planes, a good
                                many of them now. And they said, what kind of jet planes. He didn't
                                specify what kind. I don't know—he may have spoken later on the
                                facts. What they want is the Phantom plane. We have put ourselves in
                                the position to sell them Phantom planes with a decision not later
                                than January of this year by some adjustment in our production
                                schedules if we conclude that by that time the military parity is
                                such and the requirements of their security are such that it is
                                desirable. We don't want to be in a position of just being arms
                                merchants and starting an arms race with the Russians there, and
                                we're also trying very hard to use this to try to bring about the
                                success of the <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>
                                mission, to get both of them to do something themselves to find an
                                area of agreement in that part of the world.</p>
                            <p>“The Russians have stepped up their supplies to the Arabs
                                substantially and they have replaced a good deal of what was lost in
                                the June conflict. I might say that the encouragement the candidates
                                have given some folks in this campaign year is not unanticipated and
                                unexpected. For that reason, we have put ourselves—they have
                                really—are for giving them whatever is necessary to insure the
                                favorable consideration at their hands. March 31st I took a step
                                that didn't require that of me and we are going to look at it very
                                carefully and be sure that we think that it is not only their
                                interest and our interest but in the world interest before we
                                act.</p>
                            <p>“And the Congress I think, the House indicated its approval of
                                supplying the Phantom when it passed the Foreign <gloss
                                    target="#t_AID1">Aid</gloss> Bill. The Senate has also indicated
                                its feelings to a somewhat more modified extent. The measure is
                                still in conference. I'm not saying that we are going to supply them
                                or not going to supply them, but that decision hasn't been reached
                                now and our Joint Chiefs haven't passed on it. They think they have
                                adequate security at the present time. The Israelis I think really
                                demonstrated that they had it. Since then we have made available
                                some very fine jet aircraft to them, but it is not the ultimate in
                                the world and it's the ultimate they seek.”</p>

                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> observed that the
                        Israeli Deputy Minister had been here and it was an off the record meeting.
                        The Ambassador was <pb n="488" xml:id="pg_488" facs="0516"/>with him and
                        they took the position in the light of the events in Czechoslovakia that the
                        reaction to the Middle East the last day or two with the skirmishes they
                        have had to require very prompt action on the part of the United States. The
                        President asked <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt Rostow</persName> to
                        comment. Mr. <persName>Rostow</persName> reported that Deputy Prime Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_AY1">Allon</persName> was making a strong plea to
                        the President for the 60 Phantoms. He said the arguments taken were—that
                        after the Czech experience it had (a) made the Russians anxious to have us
                        or somebody else take the light of the world publicity off them, and (b)
                        possibly encourage the Egyptians to start probing across to the Canal
                        because of the passivity of the Western reaction to the Russian entrance
                        into Czechoslovakia, and he therefore urged, along with the conventional
                        arguments that we advanced, not to be delivered until they announce
                        them.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Rostow</persName> reported that in private conversation before
                        the President came in, Luke Battle and <persName>Rostow</persName> probed
                        them a bit on their position in Jerusalem which is critical to the
                        possibility of a deal with <persName>Hussein</persName>, and he indicated
                        considerable give on the press issue, our position with respect to religious
                        monuments, but nothing on the sovereignty of the city as a whole.
                            <persName>Rostow</persName> said that he and <persName corresp="#p_BLD1"
                            >Battle</persName> had pressed them on the <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                            >Jarring</persName> mission, and they said they were forthcoming with
                            <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>. <persName
                            corresp="#p_AY1">Allon</persName>'s main pitch was that the Arabs will
                        not begin to make peace until they are convinced that Israel is
                        unattackable, and that the Phantom delivery is the key to that.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then turned to the
                            Middle East and raised this question: In the wake of their paper to us
                            on the Middle East,<note n="3" xml:id="d249fn3">See <ref target="#d245"
                                    >Document 245</ref>.</note> is there any way that a Summit
                            meeting might push us towards peace in the Middle East? I then pointed
                            out to him that the paper they had given us was interesting in
                            structure, but it did not come to grips with the Israeli judgment that
                            only direct negotiations could lead to a settlement which would be
                            politically and psychologically stable. I told him we were taking the
                            Soviet paper seriously, but there were problems with it, including the
                            relationship of any views that might be developed between the United
                            States and the Soviet Union on the one hand, and the <persName

                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then made a long reply
                            with the following points: <list>
                                <item>—After the Arab-Israeli war, the Soviet Union could have
                                    exploited the situation to set up bases and greatly to
                                    strengthen its military and political position in the Middle
                                    East. They had decided not to do so. This paper reflected an
                                    authentic desire for a stable settlement.</item>
                                <item>—We should be conscious of one particular point in the Soviet
                                    proposal; namely, the idea of a Four-Power guarantee of Middle
                                    Eastern borders. The idea had come to him through Dr.
                                        <persName>Nahum Goldman</persName>, an old Zionist. He,
                                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>, and the
                                    Soviet Government had concluded that a Four-Power guarantee of
                                    the Middle Eastern frontiers was the most solid basis the
                                    Israelis could acquire for the continuity of their national
                                    existence—more solid than a peace treaty with the Arab states.
                                    He suggested that, perhaps, an agreement on this particular
                                    point might be a constructive item for a Summit meeting.</item>
                                <pb n="490" xml:id="pg_490" facs="0518"/>
                                <item>—As for the rest of the substance of the paper, he thought
                                    that <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> might submit
                                    some such paper against the background of prior U.S.-Soviet
                                    agreement. <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> had
                                    been running around the Middle East, but not making much

                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> and Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_AS1">Argov</persName>, urged <gloss

                            Israel. Presentation emphasized theme that while Israel currently strong
                            enough defeat Arabs (particularly in present geographical posture) the
                            Phantoms would serve as a deterrent to war and encouragement to peace.
                            Arabs would only give serious consideration to peace if the possibility
                            of their military superiority removed. Soviet aggression against
                            Czechoslovakia has convinced Egyptians that Soviets are no longer
                            cautious and this, together with Egyptian postwar rearmament, has
                            prompted Egyptians to initiate recent serious incidents along Suez
                            Canal. <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> decision now sell Israel
                            Phantoms would convince Arabs of futility of seeking military solution
                            to Arab-Israel dispute.</item>

                        <item>Secretary asked <persName corresp="#p_AY1">Allon</persName> about
                            status of Israeli missile program. <persName corresp="#p_AY1"
                                >Allon</persName> replied that as far as a Surface-to-Surface
                            Missile (<gloss target="#t_SSM1">SSM</gloss>) was concerned, “Israeli
                            dreams had vanished.” Declared that if the proposed deal with the French
                            for Mirage aircraft was “dead,” the MD-620 program was “doubly-dead.”
                            Asked if Israel was not itself making an <gloss target="#t_SSM1"
                                >SSM</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_AY1">Allon</persName> replied:
                            “No, not yet.” Both <persName corresp="#p_AY1">Allon</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> declared they did not
                            attach much importance to Israeli acquisition of an <gloss

                            “conventional warheads” and such missiles require extremely high degree
                            of accuracy. On other hand, Egyptian possession of <gloss

                            could give that Phantoms would not be used to deliver nuclear weapons
                            and why <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> had not signed <gloss

                                >Allon</persName> replied: “I can assure you on behalf of the Prime

                            American inspection of Dimona reactor as giving additional assurances.
                            When Secretary commented that these inspections applied only to Dimona
                                <persName corresp="p_AY1">Allon</persName> replied that Israel was a

                                <persName corresp="#p_AY1">Allon</persName> saw such a guarantee,

                                <persName corresp="#p_AY1">Allon</persName> replied that increased

                        opened yesterday's conversation by asking what was new, I gave him a copy of

                                    positive step. He added that the Jordanian Ambassador had called
                                    to congratulate the President on a “balanced” speech, and that
                                    Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> had

                                toward a more active Presidential role in attempting to move the
                                Arab-Israeli impasse toward a settlement. He singled out the
                                following points for initial comment: <list>
                                    <item>—He “saluted” the President's call for the parties to get
                                        substance on the table and begin talking specifics of a
                                        settlement. He thought that was extremely important coming
                                        from the President and hoped Israel would take note and put
                                        an end to the sterile semantic exercises that <persName
                                            corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> has been engaging

                                    <item>—He regretted that the President had not mentioned
                                        “withdrawal.” When I said I thought that was implicit in the
                                        paragraph on territorial integrity, he said an issue as
                                        important as this should be explicitly handled.</item>
                                    <item>—He started to object to the fact that the President had
                                        said we cannot return to the situation of June 4 in a
                                        paragraph having to do with territorial integrity. He felt
                                        this confused “boundaries” and “situation.” However, when I
                                        marched him through a sentence-by-sentence <pb n="494"
                                            xml:id="pg_494" facs="0522"/>reading of the paragraph
                                        pointing out that we had always said there could be border
                                        rectifications in the context of an agreed settlement and
                                        that the President had also explicitly ruled out drawing
                                        boundaries on the right of conquest alone, he backed away.
                                        In the course of the discussion, he said that the <gloss
                                            target="#t_GUAR1">GUAR</gloss> accepted the concept that
                                        we could not return to the “situation” of June 4—that we
                                        should end the state of war, draw permanent boundaries and
                                        settle the other outstanding issues mentioned in the
                                        Security Council Resolution.</item>
                                    <item>—He started to say that the Jerusalem paragraph was weak,
                                        and I pointed out that we had elevated it to the status of a
                                        separate principle. He immediately said it might be serious
                                        that we had removed Jerusalem from under the concept of
                                        territorial integrity. I said that was not our concept at
                                        all; in fact, we had never thought of it.</item>

                            <item>He asked whether I had drafted the speech. I said, “We consider

                                    President</hi>, I said it was a short 15-20 minute call
                                scheduled so that <persName corresp="#p_AY1">Allon</persName> could
                                pay his respects. When <persName corresp="#p_GA1">Ghorbal</persName>
                                tried to find out exactly who had said what, I said it was a short
                                conversation in which there was no detailed substantive exchange.
                                The Deputy Prime Minister had briefly outlined Israel's view of the
                                current situation in the Middle East, and the President had stressed
                                the importance of moving forward to peace. When <persName
                                    corresp="#p_GA1">Ghorbal</persName> asked whether <persName
                                    corresp="#p_AY1">Allon</persName> had raised the Phantoms, I
                                simply smiled and said that it wouldn't be surprising if he had.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_GA1">Ghorbal</persName> said he certainly
                                would have, had he been in <persName corresp="#p_AY1"

                                    Security Council</hi>, I countered by asking him—since he had
                                raised the issue—what inferences we should draw from the sudden
                                increase in mining incidents on the Israeli-occupied side of the
                                Canal. He made the following two semi-contradictory points: <list>
                                    <item>—The Israelis are throwing up a smoke screen and
                                        manufacturing these incidents. According to his information
                                        from Cairo, the Egyptians had no knowledge of anyone
                                        crossing from the Egyptian side. He said the Israelis
                                        themselves were engaged in a “ridiculous little cops and
                                        robbers business” to draw attention away from their own
                                        failure to move toward peace.</item>
                                    <pb n="495" xml:id="pg_495" facs="0523"/>
                                    <item>—People in the Arab world are becoming generally
                                        frustrated and an increase in incidents like this is exactly
                                        what we must expect from now on. When I said this sounded as
                                        if he were suggesting that there might indeed be a
                                        connection between an increase in the number of incidents
                                        and a conscious policy decision, he simply said that there
                                        were Arabs on the Israeli side of the cease-fire line who
                                        were frustrated too.</item>

                            East. He stressed that he had authorized Foreign Minister Rifai to take
                            advantage of all opportunities to promote a settlement, including
                            meeting privately with the Israelis if given an incentive to do so. The
                            King complained that the United States had not taken an active enough
                            role in promoting a settlement. He also said that possible U.S. supply
                            of Phantom aircraft to Israel made it difficult for him and others in
                            the area to defend their relationship with the United States. (Ibid.,

                        <item>After the King raised the possible sale of Phantoms to Israel (Amman
                            6653), I commented that as of yesterday the White House Press Secty had
                            stated no decision has been made to supply them. The Israeli request is
                            still “under consideration,” as stated last Jan. Nine months have gone
                            by since the President met with PriMin <persName corresp="#p_EL1"
                                >Eshkol</persName>. During this time some Arab leaders have been
                            making statements that fall just short of calling for “another round.”
                            Some of them were boasting about the degree to which they had been able
                            to obtain new arms from <pb n="501" xml:id="pg_501" facs="0529"/>the
                            SovUnion. The presence of thousands of Soviet instructors in the <gloss
                                target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and Syria has become well known to the
                            general public. I wondered sometimes if the Arab public remembered the
                            bellicose statements of Arab officials when they reacted to statements
                            about Phantoms for Israel. In any case, it seemed to me personally that
                            the administration has shown great restraint in so far avoiding steps
                            that could be interpreted as upsetting arms relationships in the Middle
                            East.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>The King then asked me if Washington had given any thought to what
                            might be provided to Jordan as an offset in the event that Phantoms were
                            sold to Israel. I replied I was not aware that this hypothetical
                            possibility had been considered. I jokingly commented that our thinking
                            generally revolved around avoiding sales of arms. The King then said he
                            had thought about having <persName corresp="#p_KGA1">Gen
                                Khammash</persName> go to Washington to request earlier delivery of
                            eighteen additional F104s and other essential equipment, including 155s.
                            I commented that I thought such a visit would be inappropriate at the
                            present time. With regard to the outstanding request for 155s, I thought
                            that the climate for its consideration might be improved if there were a
                            cessation of artillery exchanges in the Beisan area.</item>

                        <item>At one point the King interjected that the Soviets have indicated they
                            are prepared to supply a “much more sophisticated aircraft with
                            offensive capability" to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> if the
                            US supplies Phantoms to Israel. He obviously thought that he had made a

                            Soviets.</item>

                            to do it in a way which would strengthen, not weaken, <persName

                            contacts at a relatively early stage on certain specific issues. Like
                            the Russians, we, too, could give our paper to <persName

                            and the Russians that we are counting on him to move forward and that we
                            and, we hope, the Russians will be trying to be helpful from the rear.
                            This is the message we would also get across to the Arabs. [Footnote in

                                >UN</gloss> General Assembly. He emphasized the need for Israel to
                            define what it meant by secure and recognized borders or to publicly
                            accept and agree to implement Resolution 242. Paragraph 5 of the

                            conviction that the crux of the problem lay in promoting an agreement

                            and the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> was dependent on Israeli

                    <p>In <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>'s view—which many of your
                        advisors share—the main roadblock is Israel's inability to state its view of
                        where boundaries <pb n="503" xml:id="pg_503" facs="0531"/>should be. Israel
                        cannot do this until the Cabinet makes a decision. <persName
                            corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName> has delayed forcing that decision
                        until the Arabs enter direct negotiations. The Arabs will not surrender that
                        trump card-symbolizing recognition of Israel-until they believe the Israeli
                        government has committed itself to withdrawal.</p>
                    <p>Many of your advisors feel that we can't hope for progress on any front until
                        we tackle Israel on this issue. For instance, they feel that any response to
                        the Soviet initiative—desirable as a response may be—will be academic until
                        we can bring Israel along behind a counterproposal. This is why we
                        recommended as the centerpiece of your B'nai B'rith speech: ”… put their
                        views on the table—begin talking the substance of peace.”</p>
                    <p>The Israelis would argue vigorously that they are ready to put their views on
                        the table <hi rend="italic">only when</hi> they are convinced <persName
                            corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> is ready to talk real peace. And
                        they don't think he is. While no one has any illusions about <persName
                            corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                            >Jarring</persName> believes the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> is
                        ready to end belligerency. We're not sure, but we think there's enough in
                        the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> position to be worth probing.</p>
                    <p>Where we disagree with Israel is that they're holding out for a complete Arab
                        cave-in right from the start—open borders, full recognition, reconciliation.
                        We see the road to that goal made up of a series of stepping stones, and we
                        see a settlement not as “instant peace" but as a framework within which
                        attitudes can change. We think Israel is holding out for too much and losing
                        sight of substantial gains within its grasp—permanent boundaries and passage
                        through the Canal.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, many of your advisors—while agreeing we must treat the Soviet
                        proposal seriously—would hate to see us pin too much hope on it by itself.
                        They believe we must concentrate primarily on moving the Israelis to make
                        their commitment to withdraw clear by stating their position on boundaries.
                        If you were to go ahead with Phantoms, they would consider this a fair
                        return.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>The Secretary said that we would shortly enter on intensive discussion with
                        other powers in New York on the Near East problems and he hoped that we
                        could keep closely in touch with Israel. It was important that we know what
                        the Israeli position is on the Security Council resolution and on such
                        questions as boundaries, Jerusalem, procedures, etc. It was important also
                        that we know whether Israel considers the problem as one to be solved in its
                        entirety as a package or whether it might be broken down into parts which
                        might then be negotiated. The Palestine problem made a large and complex
                        package but it might be possible or desirable to break it up and deal with
                        the components in different contexts. The Secretary thought we also ought to
                        consider whether the best approach to settlement was to aim for an Egyptian
                        settlement first leaving the more difficult Jordanian problem aside.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> said it was
                        important to distinguish between the parliamentary situation in the United
                        Nations and the real life situation on the ground. The Government of Israel
                        is convinced that in the course of <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                            >Nasser</persName>'s stay in the Soviet Union an agreement was reached
                        on a <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>-Soviet strategy. Both governments
                        are interested primarily in restoring the status quo ante June 5, 1967 with
                        only minor modifications. Neither power was interested in a real peace. The
                        Egyptian position of rejecting reconciliation and of a termination of state
                        of belligerency with continued isolation of Israel in the Near East could
                        provide the seeds for the next war.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> said the present
                        Soviet strategy is to gain time to strengthen the <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                            >UAR</gloss> militarily and to seek a settlement which would leave the
                        Arab-Israel problem extant. During <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                            >Nasser</persName>'s second visit to Russia an agreement had been
                        reached to provide 100 additional new <pb n="505" xml:id="pg_505"
                            facs="0533"/>aircraft, 550 new tanks and an additional 100 Soviet pilots
                        for the Egyptian Air Force. The <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> has
                        agreed to tailor its policy to Soviet objectives. The <gloss
                            target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> now supports guerrilla warfare as a means
                        of supporting Soviet-<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> political aims in
                        the area. The Soviet strategy to return the situation to pre-June 1967
                        includes, first, bringing all parties to accept the <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                            >UK</gloss> resolution and, second, through <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                            >Jarring</persName> or through international consultation to fix a date
                        for withdrawal of Israeli forces to the June 4 lines. As next phase, the
                        states involved would deposit documents recognizing such things as the right
                        of nations to national existence and a termination of the state of
                        belligerency. Makeshift measures for transit through the Straits of Tiran, a
                            <gloss target="#t_UNEF1">UNEF</gloss> force in Sinai and at Sharm
                        ash-Shaykh, a phased withdrawal to permit Egyptian forces to take over and
                        clear the Suez Canal would also be included.</p>
                    <p>The Soviets also proposed that the Security Council issue a guarantee for the
                        boundaries. As the Israelis understand it, such problems as refugees,
                        Jerusalem and Israeli use of Suez Canal would be put aside for later
                        Security Council action.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said this was a Soviet presentation of an Arab plan. Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> replied this is not an
                        Arab plan but rather a Soviet plan which has been coordinated with <persName
                            corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>. There is “no peace in it.” It is
                        significant that the Soviets propose to leave the refugee problem for
                        consideration after Israel withdraws completely from occupied territories.
                        The refugee problem is the Palestine problem and the Soviets and the <gloss
                            target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> desire to keep the refugees as such in
                        order to continue to threaten the existence of Israel.</p>
                    <p>There is no question, said the Ambassador, of the background of hate that
                        exists against Israel, nor is there a question that this will be eliminated
                        by an agreement, but it cannot start to be eroded without a peace agreement
                        and “open boundaries.” Peace must involve recognition and contacts to reduce
                        hatreds.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that he was struck by the Soviet reference to
                        “multilateral documents" as a means of registering agreement. Would this be
                        acceptable if the document were signed by all the parties to the recent
                        conflict. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> replied
                        that Israel was not dealing with a coalition but with neighbors, with each
                        of which it had distinct and special problems. The Soviet plan, he said,
                        avoids a contractual arrangement between the parties.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked whether Israel is prepared to make a public and categoric
                        declaration that it is prepared to withdraw from occupied territories to
                        secure and recognized boundaries in a context of peace. Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> said that Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> is in a much better position to answer
                        this question, but that personally he did not find difficulty with such a
                        statement. The problem was that of the line of withdrawal. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DM1">Dayan</persName> had told <persName corresp="#p_BGW1"
                            >Ball</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> that
                        the Security Council <pb n="506" xml:id="pg_506" facs="0534"/>Resolution
                        could be interpreted as calling for withdrawal to the June 4 line. <persName
                            corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1"
                            >Sisco</persName> had argued that this was not so but <persName
                            corresp="#p_DM1">Dayan</persName> was not convinced.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that the U.S.G. is not in favor of substantial changes
                        from the former armistice lines but feels that discussions between the
                        parties should lead to a definition of boundaries that each side would find
                        acceptable.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> stressed that to
                        Israel there was a major difference between “elimination of war"
                        (termination of belligerency) and peace. Peace did not equate with an end to
                        the state of war. The Soviets have agreed to help the <gloss
                            target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> regain its territory without entering into
                        a state of peace. The Secretary said that Arab concern that Israel would not
                        budge from occupied territories might lead them to seek solutions other than
                        that provided by the <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> Mission.
                        He said the U.S.G. has no reason whatsoever to believe the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> wants to see the destruction of
                        Israel.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> agreed but said that
                        a condition less than peace would permit the Soviets to continue to exploit
                        Arab-Israel tensions. The Secretary replied that the Soviets would find that
                        the Arabs are not easy to control. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1"
                            >Rabin</persName> said that, nevertheless, by exploiting Arab animosity,
                        the Soviets were deriving more and more concessions from them.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said it was very important that the Israelis get into the
                        territorial questions. Wasn't it possible for Israel to indicate to the
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> that its territory could be returned
                        almost completely? The Ambassador replied that Sharm ash-Shaykh was a
                        critical issue. Twice it had brought war. In addition, Israel must avoid the
                        situation where one side by moving troops and making threats could force
                        Israel into war. The Secretary asked whether a four-power force at Sharm
                        ash-Shaykh might be reasonable assurance for Israel. Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> replied that great powers have their
                        own global interests which could lead them to compromise on matters of vital
                        interest to Israel. He said Israel had too long relied on vague assurances,
                        assurances on territorial integrity, and even more specific ones. When the
                        chips were down, Israel discovered it could only rely on itself. It is
                        better to rely on specific capabilities than on guarantees that might be
                        interpreted differently in critical periods.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary replied that Israel had been told that if it went it alone, it
                        would be alone and Israel had attacked without consultation. Israel had not
                        relied on the guarantees and it is unfair now to charge that they were
                        worthless. In addition, Israel had told us it would not resort to war.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> asked whether the
                        Strait would be open now if there had been no war. The Secretary replied
                        that Israel had not given <pb n="507" xml:id="pg_507" facs="0535"/>the time
                        necessary to test other solutions. If Israel had waited through Wednesday,
                        the answer might well have been “yes.” However, Israel had made its own
                        judgment on what it would do.</p>
                    <p>Israel was in a strange position, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1"
                            >Rabin</persName> said. It was the only country not part of an alliance
                        system which was surrounded by enemies daily threatening it with
                        destruction. At the same time, however, Israel was asked continually to
                        demonstrate that it wanted peace.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> said Israel was
                        concerned with Soviet-Arab reaction to the lack of U.S. response to the
                        Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia, the delay in providing the Phantom
                        aircraft, and the delay in rejecting the Soviet proposal for a Near East
                        settlement. These developments were interpreted as signs of U.S. weakness
                        and tend to stiffen the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> position and
                        erode U.S. policy as expressed to Israel and generally understood. Sisco and
                        Battle had told him that the U.S.G. was considering proposals which are
                        clearly incompatible with stated U.S. policy.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary replied that the Soviet proposal was a “mixed bag" with some
                        good elements among the bad. We could not reject out of hand an approach by
                        a major power which avowed an attempt to cooperate in bringing peace to the
                        area. The President's position on the Phantom was as given in January.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador replied that the approach was a stratagem designed to bring
                        about a break between U.S. and Israeli policy.</p>
                    <p>Reverting to the Secretary's question as to seeking agreement first with the
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, the Ambassador said that the basic
                        difference between Jordan and Egypt was that <persName>Hussein</persName> is
                        now ready even for a peace treaty; the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                        seeks to avoid peace. The extent to which the King is capable of entering a
                        separate peace is doubtful as is the question of his authority within
                        Jordan. Peace, therefore, is the principal point of difference between the
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and Jordan.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked whether there would not be considerable advantage to King
                            <persName>Hussein</persName> if the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                        could move first toward settlement. The Ambassador replied that neither the
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> nor the Soviets are interested in
                        the kind of peace that Israel wants. The Secretary replied that if this were
                        indeed the case, then it is up to Israel to expose their positions. One way
                        to do this would be for Israel to come forward with a reasonable plan for
                        peace. The Ambassador said that Israel had tried this in contacts with both
                        states, and it had not worked. The Secretary questioned whether the “nuts
                        and bolts" of a settlement had indeed been tackled.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said it was going to be necessary for the U.S.G. to become more
                        specific in interpreting the President's Five Points and the Security
                        Council Resolution. It would be of value to us to know what Israel's views
                        are with respect to these matters. He hoped that <pb n="508" xml:id="pg_508"
                            facs="0536"/>when <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> met with
                        him he would be prepared to be more specific on Israel's views. This would
                        be extremely important before we talk to other governments, as we must.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> said that the first
                        purpose of any effort must be to demonstrate that peace is attainable. The
                        Secretary asked what this meant. Doesn't peace rest on a multitude of things
                        that must be spelled out in detail? Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1"
                            >Rabin</persName> replied that it was useless to spell these out in
                        detail when the other side did not want peace. The Secretary thought that
                        this was the whole purpose of the exercise in which we had been engaged over
                        the past months: to move the situation in the direction of peace. Israel had
                        not been specific on the underpinnings of peace either in talks with
                            <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> or in what was imparted to
                        the Arabs. It was not enough to chant “Peace.” Both in Hanoi and in
                        Washington peace was the cry. Yet peace would not be attainable until we got
                        down to the specifics of what must underlie it.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> questioned whether
                        any <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> leader had stated that Egypt desires
                        peace. The Secretary responded that this was a difficult thing for a leader
                        to do publicly when the enemy sat on a considerable piece of his territory.
                        For over seven years he had been assuring Arab governments that Israel had
                        no territorial ambitions. What could he say now?</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> replied that before
                        the war Israel sought peace on the basis of the ADL's. Israel had not wanted
                        war; it had been forced on her. Now, the situation had changed. Israel's
                        security must be uppermost, and peace was the only alternative to measures
                        necessary to insure Israel's security.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> be
                        informed that he would desire to resume with him the discussion on the
                            <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> and on Israel's missile program
                        which, apparently, Deputy Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_AY1"
                            >Allon</persName> had not wished to get into.</p>

                    <p>The Secretary had a vigorous talk with <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1"
                            >Rabin</persName> last night. He said it's up to Israel to make its
                        position clear—to move beyond generalities and get into specifics. When
                            <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> said this is impossible
                        until Israel knows whether the Arabs want peace, the Secretary replied that
                        this must be possible because it is the whole purpose of the exercise. The
                        only way to find out what the Arabs want is to test them with specific
                        proposals.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> left the attached
                            Aide-Memoire.<note n="2" xml:id="d257fn2">See <ref target="#d256fn2"
                                >footnote 2, Document 256</ref>.</note> It says, in essence, that
                        Israel wants real peace—not just the end of belligerency. To <persName
                            corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> “real peace" means open boundaries
                        and full recognition. But the Aide-Memoire does not go that far; it speaks
                        of permanent boundaries, agreed security arrangements, and the other issues
                        in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Resolution.</p>
                    <p>The Aide-Memoire argues that the Soviet proposal is “totally and drastically
                        opposed" to Israel's policy and ours, because it aims only at withdrawal and
                        not at permanent peace. The Israelis somehow know the full details of the
                        Soviet proposition. They urge us to reject it out of hand. <persName
                            corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> argued that the US response to the
                        Czech crisis, failure to make the decision on Phantoms, and indication that
                        it might even consider the Soviet plan have all created a Soviet and Arab
                        impression that the US is weak and is about to back down.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary did not say how we planned to respond to the Soviet plan. He
                        told <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> only that the Soviet
                        proposition was a mixed bag—one that we could not reject 100% out of
                        hand.</p>
                    <p>This was a fairly tough conversation and highlights our main problem in
                        moving toward peace. We don't really disagree with the Israelis that the
                        Soviet proposal is generally unacceptable. We do disagree with their
                        definition of “peace.” They seem to be holding out for a complete Arab
                        “change of heart" whereas we have thought more of the step-by-step evolution
                        of peace through a series of practical arrangements. We've thought of a
                        settlement as a framework within which peace <pb n="510" xml:id="pg_510"
                            facs="0538"/>could evolve. The Israelis seem unwilling to launch that
                        process until they are assured that the Arabs have caved, but the Secretary
                        is right in saying there will be no progress until they do.</p>

                        <item>Accompanied by <persName corresp="#p_BDC1">Bergus</persName> I called
                            today on Foreign Minister Riad for one hour frank, very warm exchange
                            views. After lengthy pleasantries, I said that I felt my visit should be
                            one in which we looked not to past but to the future. I was concerned at
                            increased tension in area which underlined need for getting on with an
                            inevitable job before us. All of us had important roles to play. These
                            roles vary. If there is no progress, we cannot forgive ourselves nor
                            will history forgive any of us who might have contributed to progress.
                            So far, no one had done as much as he could. The upcoming General
                            Assembly with the key Foreign Ministers in New York was an opportunity
                            which we must not lose. I asked what the Minister saw ahead of
                            us.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>Riad agreed we must make special effort next few weeks. A critical
                            stage has been reached and something must be done. <persName
                                corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> is doing his best but what can
                            be expected? The <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> has refused him
                            nothing and the Israelis have insisted on direct negotiations and a
                            peace treaty which no one in the Arab world can accept. This means
                            Israelis don't want settlement. Everyone talks about peace and a
                            settlement but the meaning of these words, plus particularly the phrase
                            “secure boundaries,” [is?] remote with everyone giving his own
                            interpretation. While all express approval <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                                >Jarring</persName> Mission, what it needs is “fuel.” Implementation
                            of the resolution has been refused by Israelis and only <pb n="511"
                                xml:id="pg_511" facs="0539"/>Washington can tell Israel what to do.
                            More and more arms are going to Israel from US. More and more planes are
                            promised them. Both candidates are committed. How can there be movement
                            if US insists Israelis must have air superiority. They can occupy and
                            destroy and are in a happy position from which they can threaten others.
                            They get all the money they need. Why should they withdraw? They hope to
                            destroy the regime in <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and in Syria.
                            Riad hopes they can be convinced to find a just solution but he is not
                            expecting much at <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. He had made
                            suggestions at Stockholm which called for a timetable, a program, or
                            call it what you will. The result in the Arab world has been critical
                            and there had been suggestions for Arab summit to review position he had
                            taken which underlines political problem in <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                                >UAR</gloss> and in Arab countries.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>I replied that we had both heard all arguments perhaps too many times
                            about the past. I must underline that neither side had done as much as
                            it could or as much as was necessary. There had been moments when it
                            seemed to us the sides were close to a situation in which movement was
                            possible but each side had passed the other in the night. Riad referred
                            to US leverage; I must refer to Egyptian leverage. He said the world
                            looked to the US; I said that the world looked to <gloss
                                target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and to Israel. There had been too much
                            talk of modalities and inadequate testing by either party of the real
                            substance of the position of the other party. I must point out that the
                            Israelis now talked a great deal less about direct negotiations and
                            peace treaty, indicating more flexibility on a key issue. In my opinion,
                            for the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> to continue to insist on no
                            negotiations was as unrealistic as for Israelis to insist negotiations
                            could only take one form. We had repeatedly stated our position on this
                            matter, most recently in a very important speech by President <persName

                            that he expected nothing in New York unless the US moved is in effect to
                            dodge the issue and shatter hopes of mankind. Basic issue is whether
                            Arabs and Israelis are willing to live with each other. What the
                            Israelis want is acceptance of their existence and a contractual
                            arrangement in a form the world can understand and support resolving the
                            issue once and for all. This does not necessarily mean exchange of
                            Ambassadors or diplomatic acceptance but it did mean willingness to live
                            and let live.</item>

                            before and after the present war supplied arms but in much smaller
                            quantities than requested. When <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                            rearms itself in great quantities and increases personnel other

                            had shown great restraint and continued to do so. While I regretted such
                            issues found their ways into domestic campaigns, I must point out that

                            accommodation. US has a role to play but, as in past, <gloss
                                target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> tended believe our leverage greater in
                            any situation than it was in fact. We wished find way to help and we
                            want and need peace in area but such leverage as we had in situation not
                            being utilized when both parties focused on modalities and when issues
                            substance not dealt with in manner in which we could press parties
                            effectively toward middle and common ground between their two extreme
                            positions. Both sides, in absence negotiations, permitted their own
                            public opinion to drift and positions harden and cheated themselves of
                            leverage international community might exert towards settlement. Neither
                            the Arabs nor Israelis could afford another round of military action.
                            That Israelis must withdraw in context settlement had always been US
                            position but we cannot say what boundaries would be agreeable. There are

                            Riad had referred to fact Israel “happy.” No one could find happiness in

                        <item>Riad replied there was no end to the arguments each side made. He

                            or Tel Aviv and that what was told to us privately often was at variance
                            with public statements both sides. I urged <gloss target="#t_UAR1"

                        <item>Riad agreed too much had been said. He pointed to Jordan as country
                            which had attempted test intentions without success. Riad spoke in some

                            going on between Israelis and Jordanians. He referred specifically to
                            Israeli contacts Palestinian leaders. In response Israel had declined to
                            discuss substance. At present Jordanians feared another Israeli attack.

                            from my own residence in area. US had public opinion problems which led

                            22 resolution. Algeria and Syria had refused and Algeria had abstained

                            will be more time. There must be more talk in New York and Riad hopes

                                effective military machine. This would involve the shipment of
                                additional military equipment (<persName corresp="#p_RLGY1"
                                    >Rabin</persName> mentioned 100 new aircraft, 550 new tanks, 100
                                more Soviet pilots-the same numbers he had used with Secretary

                                say how long the delivery period would be—"it might be a year and a
                                half, it might be four years.” He acknowledged that Egyptian
                                absorptive capacity would control the timing of these shipments, but
                                he maintained that the Soviets were committed to this arrangement
                                and were working hard at training.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>In return, Nasser agreed to follow the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                    >USSR</gloss>'s political strategy. The Soviets will try for a
                                political solution-not peace, but a political settlement which
                                involves return to June 4 boundaries, and leaving unsettled the
                                issues of passage through the Canal, the refugees, and Jerusalem.
                                All these are issues designed to perpetuate tension between Arabs
                                and Israelis which the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> can
                                exploit. The Soviets have agreed to back the Arab guerilla movements
                                and to a limited Egyptian increase of tension along the Suez Canal.
                                They have done this to heat up the area and to worry the US. At the
                                same time they have come to the US with their notion of a political
                                settlement, which <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> said
                                bore no relationship to either the Israeli or the US concept of a
                                lasting peace. <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> said,
                                “There is no peace in it.” This is the Soviet design and <persName
                                    corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> has subscribed to it.</item>
                        </list>
                    </p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Rostow</persName> said he wasn't at all sure the Egyptians were
                        in any position to follow a coherent strategy, but he agreed that the
                        Ambassador had outlined a serious hypothesis which we would look at
                        carefully. However, he had two outstanding reservations: <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>We have no collateral evidence to confirm that this deal was made.
                                We have received the Israeli information but Israel had not shared
                                its evidence with us so that we could make our own judgment. It is a
                                serious matter for the US to accept as a working hypothesis one for
                                which it has no independent evidence whatsoever. In response,
                                    <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> said it is very
                                difficult to share intelligence sources, but indicated that this
                                information came from a highly reliable source. (Comment: From his
                                hedging, it appeared that he might be referring both to intercept
                                and to an agent in Cairo.) At another point, however, he admitted
                                that there was some Israeli deduction involved too.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>The Israeli hypothesis seemed internally consistent until it came
                                to one point in the Soviet memo-the suggestion of a four-power
                                guarantee. If the Soviet aim is to perpetuate tension in the Middle
                                East, it <pb n="519" xml:id="pg_519" facs="0547"/>seems highly
                                unlikely that the Soviet Union would invite the US to guarantee
                                whatever settlement develops. The Soviet Union is fully aware that
                                the US keeps constitutionally accepted commitments. Vietnam has
                                proved that. If the Soviets were not serious about a final
                                settlement, the last thing they would want would be a US commitment
                                to make the details of a settlement stick.</item>
                        </list>
                    </p>
                    <p>Moving to a related point, Mr. <persName>Rostow</persName> as much as said
                        that it is preposterous for the Israelis to think that we have bought the
                        Soviet proposal lock, stock and barrel. He acknowledged that the Soviet
                        document proposed return to the situation of June 4, 1967. He recalled that
                        the US had fought that position in New York and everywhere else since the
                        second day of the June war. The President had reiterated our position just
                        two weeks ago, and there was no question of our moving away from that
                        policy. However, that was not to say that a Soviet document contained
                        nothing worth looking at.</p>
                    <p>There was one item in the Soviet proposal which especially interested the
                        Israelis—the Soviet suggestion of a four-power guarantee. Mr.
                            <persName>Rostow</persName> said that if he were an Israeli, he would
                        think very seriously about the advantages of a guarantee backed by the
                        Congress of the US. From the Israeli point of view, this would be infinitely
                        better than some treaty signed by an Arab leader. Nobody can guarantee that
                        the Congress would go along with such a proposal, but it is worth thinking
                        about. Mr. <persName>Rostow</persName> added that there are other points of
                        flexibility in the Soviet document, though he reiterated that, of course,
                        the basic proposal was a non-starter.</p>
                    <p>The discussion then turned to the process of peace-making. <persName
                            corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> said that Israel wants the Egyptians
                        to define what it means by peace. By Israeli definition, peace is
                        “reconciliation, open borders, and recognition.” Mr.
                            <persName>Rostow</persName> said that the problem is for each side to
                        define its objectives in a negotiating process of some sort.</p>
                    <p>For instance, rather than complaining about the fact that the US was looking
                        at a document the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> had given it, he
                        would like to see the Israelis produce a document of their own. They had
                        not. As far as Mr. <persName>Rostow</persName> could tell, there were no
                        serious boundary problems between Israel and the <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                            >UAR</gloss>, although we could not say so with any confidence because
                        the Israelis had not told us what their position is. <persName
                            corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> indicated that Israel would have
                        boundary problems with the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, but he did
                        not elaborate.</p>
                    <p>The conversation turned to Jordan, and Mr. <persName>Rostow</persName> said
                        that any settlement with Jordan would involve much more than a peace treaty
                        because Jordan and Israel would have to live in economic intimacy if there
                        were peace. Jerusalem is the sticking point. Mr. <persName>Rostow</persName>
                        reminded the Ambassador that General Tzur had defined the problem this way:
                        “We can't give <persName>Hussein</persName> enough in Jerusalem for him to
                        live with.” <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> said that Israel
                        would give <persName>Hussein</persName> a role in the Moslem Holy <pb
                            n="520" xml:id="pg_520" facs="0548"/>Places. He said that they had even
                        considered building an overpass or a tunnel to give the Jordanians
                        unhampered access to Jerusalem. Mr. <persName>Rostow</persName> said that
                        wasn't good enough. If there was going to be a peace settlement, they would
                        have to show more imagination than that.</p>

                    <p>Secretaries <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and <persName
                            corresp="#p_CCM1">Clifford</persName> recommend that we accede to an
                        Israeli request for 12 more Skyhawks.</p>
                    <p>You will recall that our 1966 agreement sold 48 and that you added another 40
                        after Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName>'s visit
                        last January. Now the Israelis have asked for 12 more, since the production
                        line is going to close down by April 1970 and they would like to have a few
                        extras to cover possible losses over the next few years.</p>
                    <p>Secretaries <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and <persName
                            corresp="#p_CCM1">Clifford</persName> recommend you go ahead. The Arab
                        world is still unaware of the total number of Skyhawks going to Israel, and
                        a few more added to the end of the delivery line would make little
                        difference on the diplomatic front. While this wouldn't reduce pressure for
                        the Phantoms, it would give us additional evidence for proving that we are
                        not totally insensitive to their security requirements. That plus our
                        general interest in Israel's defense are the main reasons for going ahead; I
                        don't think there's much room for a bargain here.</p>
                    <p>The only reason this comes up for decision now is that we must notify Douglas
                        Aircraft by September 30 to avoid a break in the production line which would
                        add to the price. If we're going to do it, we might as well keep the line
                        going.</p>

                            >Katzenbach</persName>, at the latter's request, at his residence on

                    <pb n="523" xml:id="pg_523" facs="0551"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> handed to the Soviet
                        Ambassador the attached paper which the Under Secretary described as the
                        views of the United States with respect to the recent communication
                        presented by the Government of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to
                        the United States.<note n="2" xml:id="d266fn2">The attached paper was
                            summarized in telegram 254018 to Tel Aviv, October 11. (Ibid., POL 27
                            ARAB-ISR)</note> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>
                        emphasized that the paper contained the views of the United States and did
                        not represent the views of the Government of Israel or any other country in
                        the area. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> pointed out
                        that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> has worked
                        long and hard and that he has a chance in the weeks ahead with the Foreign
                        Ministers present to make progress under the resolution of November 22,
                        1967. The United States expects to exercise all influence possible on the
                        situation and hopes to get substantive discussions underway in what will be
                        an important period. It is particularly important, Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> emphasized, for all pressure
                        possible to be placed upon the countries concerned and in particular the
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, Jordan, and Israel. The longer
                        there is no move toward peace, the greater the difficulty, and the United
                        States hopes very much that progress will be possible during the New York
                        meeting.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Ambassador asked what the main point was of the communication. Is
                        it merely to assist Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                        >Jarring</persName>?</p>
                    <p>The Under Secretary replied that this was the main point and that the United
                        States was making every effort to support him in his efforts.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador asked what was new in the paper. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                            >USSR</gloss> considers that there must be concrete proposals if there
                        is to be progress.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> replied that we
                        considered proposals for a solution should be advanced by <persName
                            corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> in an effort to promote agreement of
                        the parties. One of the most difficult points would be to arrive at a
                        definition, for example, of agreed and secure boundaries.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that the
                        Soviet Union agrees that adjustments in these lines are the business of the
                        parties and not the business of the Soviet Union. However, he felt that it
                        was necessary to make concrete proposals and that the Soviet Union, while
                        wishing to help Jarring, considered that its more detailed suggestions had
                        been a move in that direction. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> did
                        not wish to press its paper. If the United States does not like the Russian
                        proposal, the Russians would welcome steps by the United States to offer its
                        own plan. France has a practical approach, and other countries must be
                        equally practical.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> replied that the
                        question of timing was an important element. We consider it important to get
                        the parties down to discussion of issues and substance. We believe that we
                        have a common purpose with the Soviet Union of getting a settlement and
                        ending a <pb n="524" xml:id="pg_524" facs="0552"/>dangerous situation. We
                        are reluctant, however, to tell Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                            >Jarring</persName> what to do. He must make that decision.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> replied that Jordan was, he
                        understood, depressed and may give up. What can be done that is practical
                        and will help? The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is not trying to
                        impose a settlement because of the Czech situation. It, too, wished to help
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> said that he had not
                        brought up the Czech matter, that the Ambassador had mentioned it first.</p>
                    <p>There was general talk of the problems of the area with Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> emphasizing that the Arabs
                        primarily wanted withdrawal while the Israelis primarily want peace
                        arrangements based on recognition of their existence and a permanent
                        arrangement. The United States, of course, is aware that a peace treaty
                        would be difficult, but there were other forms of settlement that could
                        accomplish the same goal.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador agreed to present to the Government of the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> the views contained in the
                        memorandum.</p>

                                        war and the establishment of peace would become effective

                                        or through the signing of a multilateral document.” The
                                        United States believes that the peace must be based upon
                                        arrangements which directly bind the parties. Is this what
                                        is intended by the reference to a “multilateral document"?
                                        The United States believes that a document signed jointly by
                                        the parties is the most desirable, if not the only, means of
                                        obligating the parties to carry out the agreement worked out
                                        in accordance with the resolution of November 22, 1967. It
                                        believes, also, that Security Council endorsement of the
                                        terms of a settlement agreed by the parties could serve a
                                        useful purpose. The United States is not clear what a Four
                                        Power guarantee would add to such a Security Council
                                        endorsement of the agreement of the parties, but it is
                                        willing to examine the possibility at the appropriate

                            <item>The Soviet document comments at some length on the desirability of
                                a plan or timetable for implementation of the Security Council
                                resolution. The United States has no objection to the concept of a
                                plan under which the steps required for carrying out the peace
                                settlement agreed to by the parties, and the timing of those steps,
                                would be spelled out. It may be that the parties would find such a
                                detailed plan necessary since, as the Soviet document also notes,
                                the actions to be taken by the parties in carrying out their agreed
                                settlement would inevitably be interrelated and in some degree
                                interdependent. It is in light of this interrelationship that the
                                United States firmly adheres to the view that all elements of a
                                settlement must be dealt with in arriving at the terms of a
                                settlement. It is the understanding of the United States, moreover,
                                that the parties, including the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>,
                                all recognize that the Security Council resolution requires a
                                “package" which would settle all the problems left open for
                                negotiations by the resolution, whatever the chronology for
                                implementation on which they might agree. In our view this position
                                represents a proper interpretation of the resolution.</item>

                            <item>There is one specific aspect of the program outlined in the Soviet
                                document which in particular merits comment: the idea of Israeli
                                withdrawal to the pre-June 5 line. The essence of the United States
                                policy since June 5, 1967, has been and remains that the state of
                                armistice among the parties must be replaced, as the resolution of
                                November 22, 1967, states, by a condition of peace. The armistice
                                agreements of 1949 called for a transition to peace and specifically
                                contemplated the possibility of agreed changes in the armistice
                                lines of 1949 as part of that transition. The Security Council
                                resolution calls for withdrawal of Israeli armed forces to secure
                                and recognized boundaries, free from threats or acts of force, but
                                does not specify that those boundaries should be precisely the lines
                                held prior to June 5, 1967, or on any other date. In view of the
                                complexity of this question, the United States believes that this is
                                a matter which requires the priority attention of both the parties

                    <p>Jerusalem is the major sticking point. I see no agreement if the Israelis
                        limit Jordan to access to Moslem Holy Places and no agreement if Jordan
                        tries to apply principle of “no territorial acquisitions" to Jerusalem. The
                        best suggestion I know is from an Israeli junior minister: rebuild every
                        church, synagogue, and mosque there ever was in Jerusalem and gradually put
                        60,000 or so Arabs on West Bank, making old city a tri-religion
                        monument.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>It is very difficult to think of Jordan accepting Israeli outposts
                        permanently on its territory along the Jordan. The other alternatives are: <list>

                    <p>Israel might well give on Gaza, as the outlet for a transit road across
                        Israel, leaving the Gaza refugees with Jordan.</p>
                    <p>To make anything constructive out of these initial positions will take a very
                        great effort in the weeks ahead by <persName corresp="#p_JG1"

                            that for the present Israel wanted “to swim in the international

                        Israeli Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName>: (a)
                        sought to discredit recent Soviet Middle East initiative, expressing concern
                        re differing US and Israeli interpretations; (b) welcomed President's
                        September 10 speech, expressing view that reports on US-Israeli differences
                        on approach to settlement were exaggerated; and (c) made clear Israel
                        continues adhere to position that it will withdraw from ceasefire lines only
                        following signature of contractual agreements negotiated face to face at
                        some stage, either under <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>'s
                        auspices or otherwise. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> discounted
                        possibility of early progress toward settlement with <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                            >UAR</gloss> due <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> determination not
                        make peace. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> said Israel therefore
                        now gives priority to agreement with Jordan. He outlined in more specific
                        terms than heretofore concepts which Israel believes should govern
                        settlement with Jordan, which he said have been conveyed authoritatively to
                            <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> outside <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                            >Jarring</persName> context. Concepts as described by <persName
                            corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> suggest some variation of an <persName
                            corresp="p_AY1">Allon</persName> plan, though he did not so categorize
                        them. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> expressed hope for progress
                        with Jordan while in New York, looking ultimately Jordanian-Israeli meetings
                        under Jarring's auspices. At the same time, <persName corresp="#p_EA1"
                            >Eban</persName> said Israel will continue for tactical reasons to probe
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> position. <persName corresp="#p_EA1"
                            >Eban</persName> indicated that effort will also be made to improve
                        Israel's public image. To this end, while not surfacing any concrete “peace
                        plan,” he will seek make clear before General Assembly Israel's concept of
                        peace with respect to such issues as boundaries, recognition and
                        security.</p>
                    <p>Secretary made clear that US not buying “imposed solution" approach but did
                        not think Soviet positions necessarily frozen, and <pb n="530"
                            xml:id="pg_530" facs="0558"/>stressed importance of maintaining contact
                        with <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> on Middle East and other major
                        problems. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> seemed reassured by
                        Secretary's comments including US response to Soviet approach as outlined by
                        Secretary. Secretary urged Israel to pursue both direct and indirect routes
                        as feasible, to continue utilize <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                            >Jarring</persName> and not to give up on <gloss target="#t_UAR1"

                            with some welcome additions, particularly emphasis on concept that
                            Security Council resolution not self-executing but only a basis for
                            parties to reach agreement. This went to heart of diplomatic deadlock,
                            given <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> position that resolution could
                            be carried out by declamation. Behind diplomatic deadlock, however, lay
                            political deadlock arising from <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                            determination not to make peace.</item>

                            <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> continued that, while there
                            was broad area of agreement between Israel and USG on approach to
                            Arab-Israel settlement, he was not sure we shared common view of
                            international setting which was inseparable from area problems.
                            Specifically <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> thought US and
                            Israel had differing views of Soviet policy. Soviet action in
                            Czechoslovakia had caused wide concern in much of world and some friends
                            of United States were troubled by our reaction. Israel believed Soviets
                            had seriously prejudiced their position in world and that it was a
                            mistake to act as though normal relations with <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss> could be maintained. Israel believed Soviet intentions
                            should be exposed, including their increasingly truculent position in
                            Middle East and new Arab arms buildup. Czech invasion should be on
                                <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> agenda. Israel found incongruous
                            and demoralizing the idea that US would welcome Soviet signature on
                                <gloss target="#t_ME1">ME</gloss> settlement. <gloss

                            approach did not constitute peace proposal but merely proposal for
                            return to situation of June 4, 1967, with better basis than previously
                            for Soviet penetration. In Israel's view, role for great powers should
                            be to insist that responsibility rested with the parties. Once agreement
                            reached, it would be natural for there to be international endorsement
                            on pattern of 1949 armistice agreements, of which <gloss target="#t_SC1"

                            exercise, <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> said, represented
                            change of Israeli policy. Israel had begun by asking <gloss

                            <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> said Israel had concluded

                                >Eban</persName> disagreed with argument of some <gloss

                            recover its territories in context of peace. Israel's concern in Sinai
                            was security and free navigation, and <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                                >UAR</gloss> has already made clear that it did not want Gaza.
                            Problem, <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> said, was that
                                <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> wanted return of territories
                            without peace and may believe this is possible, either through 1957-type

                            <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> said that logical approach
                            therefore was to give priority to settlement with Jordan. Palestine
                            Arabs and Jordanian Government in any case more involved since Palestine
                            was heart of problem. Exchanges with <gloss target="#t_GOJ1"
                            >GOJ</gloss>, which began in April through Palestinian leaders, had
                            recently become more intensive, concrete and authoritative.
                            Israeli-Jordanian dialogue existed with respect to peace, population and
                            boundaries. While Israel had drawn no lines on map, Jordan had detailed
                            conceptual picture of what Israel wanted. Israel sought maximum security
                            with minimum change of territory and population. <pb n="532"

                            believed changes were needed in uninhabited areas of Jordan Valley. This

                            envisaged Jordan as custodian of Moslem holy places with access

                            Jordanian reaction and looked for progress in October. In response to

                            could get in position to have direct contacts. Major question was

                            in Israeli press and elsewhere were exaggerated. Some alleged that US

                                >Eban</persName> did not accept. It was clear that peace could not
                            be achieved without parties setting eyes on each other. Historically,
                            transitions from war to peace always involved contacts. Opinion in
                            Israel did not favor perpetuating ceasefire lines, but Israel could live
                            with those lines if it could not have peace. Sacrifices of recent war
                            had sharpened Israeli awareness of need for negotiated peace. Israel
                            would multiply and diversify its contacts, however, putting concrete
                            ideas on table. Israel also understood US argument that it must improve
                            its public image. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> said he had
                            no “peace plan" to present to General Assembly but would use <gloss

                            about Soviet policy, Secretary recalled that he had told <gloss

                            dangerous summer. Even then <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                            appeared moving away from peaceful coexistence. Given threat of Czech
                            developments to maintenance of Soviet position in Eastern Europe, strong
                            Soviet reaction was predictable. Soviets must have anticipated adverse
                            world reaction although extent of condemnation of Soviet invasion was
                            surprising. Secretary said <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> not
                            impressed by demands from others that US do something about
                            Czechoslovakia while they continued business as usual.</item>

                            Secretary said Soviets could be expected to attempt improve their
                            position at expense of both Israel and moderate Arab states. Best way to
                            contain Soviets in the Middle East was to find solution to Arab-Israel
                            conflict.</item>
                        <label>17.</label>
                        <item>Secretary continued that Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia had
                            interrupted aspects of US-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                            dialogue. Other problems such as Middle East and Viet-Nam had not
                            disappeared, however, and it important to maintain contact on these
                            issues. Secretary then summarized US reaction to Soviet Middle East

                            more fully briefed later. In general, Secretary said, we believed
                            parties must find their own answer; solution could not be imposed. We
                            would welcome <pb n="534" xml:id="pg_534" facs="0562"/>it if progress

                            described by Secretary seemed close to Israeli views. Noting recent New

                                >Eban</persName> asked whether we intended to comment publicly.

                            approach. He thought many issues were being re-examined in Moscow and,
                            while not overly optimistic about the outcome, did not have impression

                            Secretary tried to elicit from Riad clear statement what Egyptians were

                            Riad's responses did not add anything new to what we know of Egyptian
                            position with possible exception his remarks on refugees and willingness

                            present. Secretary opened substantive discussion by asking for <gloss

                            progress could be made. Riad said there had been no significant progress
                            since their previous meeting a year ago. He gave review of developments
                            since then, noting that King <persName>Hussein</persName> had understood
                            from our assurances that passage of November 22 resolution would mean
                            Israeli withdrawal. Egyptians had doubted this at time and events have
                            proved them right. <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> had cooperated
                            fully with <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>, but Israel had
                            not. <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> had said that he had
                            a beautiful car but had no fuel for it. We had to decide how to give him
                            a push. If <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> failed he would
                            issue a report and the matter would revert to the Security Council. This
                            question had to be faced in the next two weeks.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>The Secretary agreed that next two weeks would be critical. <persName
                                corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> and the Foreign Ministers
                            concerned were in New York and we needed intensive work by everyone to
                            get some genuine motion. US would do everything to encourage them. We
                            fully supported November 22 resolution. Secretary sometimes wondered,
                            however, whether there were not several resolutions, given differing
                            interpretations of parties. These differences were important because
                            resolution was not self-implementing. We had hoped parties would avoid a
                            procedural impasse and had not believed that Israel should insist on
                            bilateral negotiations, nor that the Arab side should exclude them for
                            doctrinaire reasons. We thought there should be talks at some stage. We
                            ourselves did not attach tragic importance to procedure and the
                            Secretary himself had engaged in negotiations with representatives of
                            Peking and Hanoi, two governments we did not recognize. We had exercised
                            flexibility and hoped the parties in the Middle East would do the
                            same.</item>

                        <item>Secretary said November 22 resolution was a package, but it was made
                            up of many parts. This was classical problem of diplomacy. The whole may
                            be too big to deal with, but pieces could not be separated from it. We
                            had hoped that by this time <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                                >Jarring</persName> would begin to put pieces together to find out
                            where problems are. Secretary then asked what Egypt's main problems were
                            from a national point of view, leaving aside the interests of Jordan and
                            Syria. We had the impression problems between Israel and Egypt were not
                            all that formidable. Where were the real difficulties for Egypt? Were
                            they bilateral or did they involve Jordan and Syria?</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>Riad said greatest problems were between Israel and Egypt because
                            Israel had manifested territorial claims to Sinai since 1956. Egyptians
                                <pb n="536" xml:id="pg_536" facs="0564"/>could not take at face
                            value declarations by Israeli leaders that they wanted peace. Problem
                            was one of security, not of procedures. He then reviewed familiar
                            Egyptian version of Israeli perfidy regarding the Rhodes and Lausanne
                                Agreements.<note n="3" xml:id="d269fn3">On February 24, 1949, Egypt

                        <item>Secretary said he gathered part of problem not so much procedure but
                            of insured implementation. Egyptians were not rejecting procedures in
                            themselves, but saying results of any agreed procedure must be carried
                            out. Riad said after two experiments it clear a piece of paper signed by
                            the Israelis was worthless. Secretary said he could understand <gloss
                                target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> concern that agreement be carried out,
                            but could not understand why it not prepared sign agreement either
                            multilateral or bilateral. Riad said <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                            not refusing to sign document. <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> said
                            it had obligations and must honor them.</item>
                        <label>7.</label>
                        <item>Secretary said he did not wish to be critical but with regard
                            importance of signature he recalled that President Eisenhower had
                            undertaken commitments regarding navigation in the Straits of Tiran.
                            Egypt had not objected but in 1967 had pointed out that it had not
                            signed the commitment and was not bound by it. We were thus left high
                            and dry by an action we took on behalf of Egypt. Signatures were
                            important. Secretary then asked if there were text of agreement worked

                            assuming withdrawal taken care of, what were the other problems? Was the

                        <item>Secretary said assuming it was agreed to end the state of belligerency
                            simultaneously with withdrawal, how could Egypt deny Israel passage
                            through Suez once belligerency ended? Riad said if state of war ended,
                                <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> would have to fulfill
                            obligations regarding international traffic through Canal, but Israeli
                            use of the Canal had been linked to refugees since 1951. Israelis must
                            respect rights of others if they want their own rights respected.
                            Secretary said he could understand organic connection between state of
                            war and use of Canal, but not between use of Canal and some third
                            question. As maritime nation interested in free transit we were
                            concerned that such transit might be denied solely for political
                            reasons. Egyptians might deny use of Canal to us some day because of
                            Viet-Nam problem or some other political issue. Riad said this not
                            problem because Americans had not killed people of Canal, as Israel had.
                            There were two aspects of the Arab-Israel problem, one of refugees and
                            one of expansion. Refugees were humanitarian problem which Israel had
                            refused to consider to date. Canal was unimportant to Israel in material
                            terms, but refugee issue was of great importance to Arabs. Secretary
                            remarked that elimination of state of war had no substance without free
                            passage. Riad said he had told <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                                >Jarring</persName> that once there was agreement on refugee
                            settlement Israeli cargo could transit Canal. Once that settlement was
                            implemented the Egyptians would permit Israeli flag to use it.</item>
                        <label>11.</label>
                        <item>Secretary said we very concerned about refugees. Why not let some
                            reliable person go to each refugee privately and individually and ask
                            him where he wanted to live? Would that work? Riad said this was in the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolution and could be done
                            through a referendum or a plebiscite. Secretary said he was not thinking
                            of a referendum where everyone would be told to vote one way or have his
                            throat cut. Riad said that if the refugees had free choice, very few of
                            them would go back to Israel and said that if money could be invested
                            in, for instance, the West Bank for economic development projects this
                            would attract many of them. He did not know why we had not tried this
                            approach in past. Secretary said he would agree, of course, that new
                            refugees, i.e. those who had fled since June 1967, must be allowed to
                            return. Riad said this would come about naturally once Israel withdrew.
                            Secretary noted that he did not think money would be a problem if there
                            was a serious solution in sight.</item>
                        <label>12.</label>
                        <item>Secretary said we had no problem with agreement on a sequence of
                            events which might be called a timetable. We were concerned, however,
                            with original idea put forth by Kosygin last year that withdrawal must
                            precede everything else. We did not know if the Soviet <pb n="538"
                                xml:id="pg_538" facs="0566"/>view had changed, but we were wary of
                            withdrawal first. This was, frankly, our problem in Paris. We had no
                            objection to stopping the bombing, but Hanoi insisted that everything
                            else must be held in abeyance until that happened.</item>

                        <item>Riad asked who was to set forth the timetable. Secretary thought it
                            would take care of itself once there was agreement on substance. Riad
                            said <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> had made its position clear on
                            substance, but Israelis refused to discuss details. Secretary said he
                            thought this might be because of procedural points. If Arabs did not
                            exclude direct talks and Israelis did not exclude indirect talks as
                            matter of doctrine, progress could start. Riad said he did not
                            understand. Talks could either be direct or indirect. Secretary remarked
                            that they could also be a combination of the two. Riad said Israelis
                            insisted on direct negotiations, which Egypt could not accept. Rhodes
                            talks had been indirect until the end, but the Israelis were refusing
                            this combination now. The Jordanians had told the Israelis they were
                            ready for such negotiations but Israel must first accept resolution
                            unequivocably. Israel had refused.</item>

                        <item>Secretary asked if <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> was ready to
                            accept Rhodes formula. Riad said Egyptians had tried it twice and it
                            didn't work. <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> was now
                            engaged in indirect negotiations in effect. He was going from one party
                            to the other, in same way Bunche did. All this talk of negotiations was
                            rhetorical. Israelis simply did not want to reach agreement.<note n="5"

                            some confusion arising from Khartoum formula. We understood it to mean
                            that there could be no formal peace treaty. Did we understand correctly
                            that <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> did not exclude eventual
                            face-to-face encounter and signature of a document if it could be
                            assured that Israel would keep its part of the bargain? Riad said at
                            Khartoum it was agreed there would be no direct negotiations, no peace
                            treaties, and no diplomatic recognition. It did not mean <gloss

                            indicating he not yet prepared to advance this to parties and requesting

                            <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> said he now inclined
                            believe most productive approach wld be to separate out key elements of
                            problem which are susceptible to early agreement, putting others like
                            Jerusalem and refugees aside for further study and agreement at later
                            stage. (He noted Sovs have similar idea re Jerusalem and said he has not
                            yet raised it specifically with Jordan because he regards it as most
                            intractable of all elements in problem.) He envisaged possibility of
                            breaking out following elements; withdrawal of troops; secure and
                            recognized boundaries; free passage through international waterways. He
                            thought there might be some hope in such combination since so many
                            nations, particularly <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and Asians,
                            keenly interested in reopening Suez Canal. Moreover, he felt territorial
                            issues between <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and Israel were
                            minimal. Therefore, he conceived of approach which would include Israeli
                            withdrawal from <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, with Sinai
                            demilitarized (possibly with <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> presence)
                            with <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> undertaking binding commitment
                            (not clear whether between parties) to terminate belligerency and
                            permitting Israeli free passage through Suez and Gulf of Aqaba.</item>

                            <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> seemed more sure than
                            before that he could get <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> signature
                            on some kind of a document that would in effect legally bind them to
                            carry out their obligations under the agreement. He also felt that
                                <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> might be able to swallow
                            agreement to let Israeli ships through Suez provided Israelis would not
                            make an ostentatious display when their first ship goes through. As part
                            of above arrangement, Israelis would be expected as first step to
                            withdraw about 30-40 kilometers from Suez. As for Gaza, he adheres to
                            earlier thought that this might be put under <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> supervision for lengthy period, possibly going later to
                            Jordan. Latter could capitalize on acquisition of Gaza to prove that
                            even if some of their territory goes to Israel they wld <pb n="541"
                                xml:id="pg_541" facs="0569"/>not suffer a net loss of land in
                            process. He did not consider Israelis would have legitimate claim in
                            saying Gaza constitutes security problem if Sinai demilitarized. Gaza of
                            course consists primarily of refugees, and solution of Gaza cld be
                            considered largely as refugee problem rather than territorial or
                            security problem. He considered that such approach would give Israelis
                            most of what they want vis-a-vis <gloss target="#t_UAR1"

                            with Jordan. Re latter, he complained that whereas Israelis say
                            Jordanians have clear picture of what they mean by secure boundaries
                            with Jordan, they have refused to tell him what they mean by it, which
                            continues to preclude him from playing significant role in advancing

                    <p>The Secretary referred to a proposal that a multilateral document settling
                        the Arab-Israeli dispute in the Middle East be signed by all the parties,
                        including Israel, Egypt and Jordan. He did not care what such a document
                        might be called, a Treaty or any other designation would do, as long as it
                        was signed at a minimum by Israel, Jordan and the <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                            >UAR</gloss>. If substantive questions were resolved, the parties could
                        sign the same document, not necessarily at one and the same time; thereby
                        they would assume certain obligations which they would undertake to carry
                        out. Mr. <persName>Gromyko</persName> inquired whether the Secretary had
                        discussed this possibility with Riad. The Secretary indicated he had,
                        although at the time Riad was accompanied by some other Arabs. He said that
                        if an Arab has an Arab for an audience things have a tendency to become
                        difficult. Riad had thought, however, that perhaps the various parties could
                        sign different copies of the same document. Mr. <persName>Gromyko</persName>
                        proposed that such a document be signed first by one side, and then Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> could take it to the other
                        side, so as to get it signed by all parties. Then, after all had signed it,
                        suppose the members of the Security <pb n="545" xml:id="pg_545" facs="0573"
                        />Council also signed, at least the permanent members. The Secretary thought
                        such a procedure might be possible. In any case, said Mr.
                            <persName>Gromyko</persName>, we should not let a comma stand in the way
                        of peace if there is agreement on substantive issues. The Secretary said
                        that he was interested to see a reference to a multilateral document in Mr.
                            <persName>Gromyko</persName>'s statement and suggested we see what could
                        be done in this respect. A second problem had to do with passage through
                        international waterways. Our understanding of the Soviet position was that
                        the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> had no objection to international
                        waterways being open. We take the same view; both our countries are maritime
                        powers. If the Arabs said that they were prepared to end the state of war
                        with Israel, it would seem that the obstacle to the passage of Israeli ships
                        through the Suez Canal would also have been removed; for over the years the
                        only justification for barring the Canal to Israeli shipping had been the
                        state of war. It follows then, that if the <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                            >UAR</gloss> now says that it is prepared to end the state of war, but
                        would postpone consideration of the question of opening the Suez Canal, then
                        these are merely words without any real substance. Riad had said that Suez
                        would be dealt with in connection with the refugee question. The Secretary
                        had suggested to him that each refugee be asked where he wanted to live,
                        whether he wanted to return to Israel or live in other countries, and that
                        this be done in a most confidential manner so that he would not get his
                        throat cut for having chosen one option over another. He was interested in
                        the fact that Riad did not turn down this idea. Perhaps we could make
                        progress on this basis, with the help of the Swiss or someone else. Mr.
                            <persName>Gromyko</persName> asked for the Secretary's estimate of the
                        number of refugees who would elect to return to their former territory. The
                        Secretary guessed that number to be no more that 10 per cent of all the
                        refugees. If this were really so, Israel would be prepared to receive them;
                        it could not, however, commit itself to receive unlimited numbers. Mr.
                            <persName>Gromyko</persName> then inquired as to the possible sequence
                        of steps concerning the Canal and the refugees, once such a poll among the
                        refugees had been taken and Israel had agreed to accept those who wanted to
                        return. The Secretary thought that one possibility was to have <gloss
                            target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss> or the Swiss or some other neutral
                        carry out the job of polling the refugees, possibly <persName
                            corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> or some such person. If we could get
                        this arrangement made and on the basis of that unlock the problem of opening
                        the Suez Canal, that in turn would unlock the problem of the state of war;
                        then we could take up territorial matters and troop withdrawal. The Israeli
                        cabinet had not as yet reached any firm conclusion on the subject; but it
                        was the Secretary's impression that there were no territorial problems that
                        could not be solved between Israel and Egypt; there were none between Israel
                        and Lebanon: the territorial problems between Israel and Jordan, he was
                        sure, could be solved by quiet, behind the scenes negotiations. There was
                        also not much of a problem in this respect between Israel <pb n="546"
                            xml:id="pg_546" facs="574"/>and Syria. Jerusalem, however, did indeed
                        present a very thorny problem. Replying to Mr.
                        <persName>Gromyko</persName>'s inquiry, the Secretary said that while he
                        would not object to the Gaza Strip being classified as Arab territory, it
                        was not Egyptian territory. He did not know what solution could be found for
                        the Gaza Strip, possibly a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> solution; of
                        course, he knew that Jordan wanted Gaza; but this problem would perhaps be
                        eased once the refugee problem was out of the way. Thus he took the view
                        that the solution of each point at dispute made the solution of other points
                        easier.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Gromyko</persName> said that it would be good for each of our
                        two sides to try to work with the appropriate sides for the purpose of
                        influencing them toward a solution. But, could we be sure that this work
                        would not be in vain, that Israel perhaps would then come out with a
                        statement saying it did not agree with the US position?</p>
                    <p>The Secretary emphasized that he was presenting the US view of these
                        problems; he did not, however, have any way of guaranteeing that Israel
                        would see things the same way as we. In this connection he also said that in
                        June 1967 we had received Israeli assurances that they would not be the
                        first to take military action, yet they had done so. On the other hand, the
                        Arabs were exaggerating; he was convinced that Israel was not engaged in a
                        major campaign of territorial expansion. Mr. <persName>Gromyko</persName>
                        asked if we had any good grounds to believe in a successful settlement of
                        the various disputes if we worked in this direction. The Secretary suggested
                        that we keep in close touch during the next three or four weeks as <persName
                            corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> explores all of these possibilities
                        first hand. Mr. <persName>Gromyko</persName> asked if the Secretary was
                        suggesting that we keep hands off during that period of time. The Secretary
                        replied that <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> needed the
                        support of the US and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to be
                        successful in his efforts. To Mr. <persName>Gromyko</persName>'s question
                        whether the Secretary was in touch with Israel directly, the Secretary
                        replied that he was. Mr. <persName>Gromyko</persName> then said that we
                        should work in parallel to get all possibilities considered while <persName
                            corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> was proceeding with the matters he
                        was working on. The Secretary called attention to a statement by <persName
                            corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName>, in which he had strongly commended and
                        supported <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>'s efforts. We would
                        also support <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>'s work by talking
                        with Israel and the Arabs, although he was sure Mr.
                            <persName>Gromyko</persName> knew that our influence with the Arabs was
                        not very great. Ambassador Malik remarked that it seemed to him our
                        influence was not very great with Israel either. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> repeated that <persName
                            corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> was working and said “let us work
                        behind the scenes.” Mr. <persName>Gromyko</persName> asked that we keep in
                        touch through the respective ambassadors; everything should be done to find
                        a solution—such was the view of the Soviet Union. The Secretary added that
                        we seemed to have common views on the points mentioned although we disagreed
                        on the most important point of view of arms limitation in <pb n="547"
                            xml:id="pg_547" facs="0575"/>the Middle East. Mr.
                            <persName>Gromyko</persName> reminded the Secretary of the assurances
                        the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> had given several times to the
                        effect that when the problem of Israeli troop withdrawal was resolved, the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would be willing to consider the
                        question of arms limitation. The Secretary said he hoped it would not be too
                        late for that by then. Mr. <persName>Gromyko</persName> said we should be
                        realistic; who would be causing trouble, surely not <persName
                            corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> or Syria. The Secretary thought both
                        sides sometimes acted as if they were crazy. Ambassador Malik objected that
                        the Arabs were victims of aggression. To that the Secretary said that in the
                        same vein we could then proceed to mention the Straits of Tiran, the Arab
                        Holy War and so on; we could argue all the way back to 1945. The fact is
                        that we have to start where we are and try to make some sense. Mr.
                            <persName>Gromyko</persName> said that in the meantime it would be good
                        if both sides could be prevailed upon to refrain from any acts which could
                        inflame the situation. He thought that the US could strongly advise Israel
                        not to stir up trouble. The Secretary said frankly that we had been doing so
                        almost every week; we get back reports of terrorist acts by El Fatah, etc.
                        As concerns Lebanon and Jordan, these two countries have been trying to
                        restrain the terrorists and Israel knows that. We would like to see a
                        situation where there were no incidents in any direction. He agreed that at
                        times Israeli reaction to terrorist acts was too violent. Mr.
                            <persName>Gromyko</persName> said that he was glad to know the Secretary
                        would talk to the Israelis. For his part, he was sure the Secretary knew
                        that he had made many private as well as public statements counselling
                        restraint. The Secretary said it would be good if Syria could be prevailed
                        upon to cooperate with her Arab neighbors, Lebanon and Jordan. Mr.
                            <persName>Gromyko</persName> said that Syria's position, with part of
                        her territory occupied, had to be understood. To that the Secretary replied
                        that the Syrians had been engaging in hostile acts long before June 1967.
                        Syria had even then been a center for El Fatah. He asked the Foreign
                        Minister to keep in touch.</p>
                    <p>The meeting ended with a brief discussion of what to say to press inquiries.
                        It was agreed to mention the subjects and areas which had been discussed but
                        also to state that no definite conclusions had been reached.</p>

                    <p>3. At their discretion addressee posts may wish to point out to local
                        contacts that President's statement was made in context of clear expression
                        Congressional views on subject and in light continuing Soviet deliveries of
                        arms to certain Arab countries. While we recognize Arabs will be prone to
                        jump to unjustified conclusions, simple fact is that arms limitation in
                        current volatile Near Eastern situation cannot be onesided. You should
                        emphasize fact that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>/<gloss
                            target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> discussions may take some time and
                        agreement will have to be reached on a range of points before there will be
                        any actual aircraft dispatched to the area.</p>
                    <p>4. Although you should avoid discussing comparison of aircraft, you may wish
                        to note that since June 1967 war Soviets have delivered many supersonic jet
                        military aircraft to Arab countries on or near Israel's borders … several
                        times the number of Phantom aircraft Israel <pb n="549" xml:id="pg_549"
                            facs="0577"/>has requested. Furthermore, with French embargo on Mirages,
                        Israel has had no source of supply for aircraft in this category to replace
                        its wartime losses. Supply of supersonic jets to Israel by <gloss

                        area.</p>
                    <p>5. We will continue work for resolution complex Arab/Israel issues in
                        peaceful atmosphere which would render provision additional arms to either

                    <p>Nick Katzenbach said he felt that, if the issue goes back to the Security
                        Council, the best we can hope for would be to have the issue referred back
                        to <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> or somebody like him,
                        perhaps with a slightly revised mandate. The worst would be a reasonable
                        solution proposed by a majority of the members of the Security Council which
                        would face us with a choice of going along against Israel's wishes or
                        abstaining.</p>
                    <p>It was generally agreed that the US should prepare itself quickly to inject
                        its views on the substance of peace terms, though there was no decision that
                        the time had actually come for us to do this.</p>
                    <p>There was also general agreement that perhaps we had worried too much in the
                        past about urging <persName>Hussein</persName> into direct negotiations.
                        Harry Symmes shared Nick's view that <persName>Hussein</persName> was
                        probably in a lot better position to go it alone if he had to than we had
                        often given him credit for, though he unquestionably would like to have a
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> umbrella. The meeting concluded with
                        agreement that we should bring out all past solutions on Jerusalem and West
                        Bank demilitarization and put them in the best shape possible.</p>

                                <persName>Hussein</persName> given to PriMin Talhouni Oct 12 along
                            with further explanations based on Dept's guidance. PriMin expressed
                            appreciation but reviewed US actions on aid, arms, and Near East issues
                            at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> as demonstrating lack of
                            balance in US position toward Jordan as compared with Israel. Asserted
                            these actions embarrassed friends of US and stimulated heavy pressures
                            from the public against those friends. These pressures had been
                            withstood but it was becoming increasingly difficult.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>I acknowledged some delays and problems inherent in our system and the
                            complexity of the situation but stressed the great strength of our
                            fundamental policies and determination to carry through on them. I also
                            suggested as a personal observation that clearing away the Phantom issue
                            might make our dialogue with the Israelis on more fundamental problems
                            easier. Meeting was cordial and overall effect of President's message,
                            particularly reaffirmation of intentions continue work for a solution,
                            seemed useful. <hi rend="italic">End Summary</hi>.</item>

                        <item>Touqan commented that they had thought of calling me in yesterday and
                            both he and PriMin expressed appreciation for information and
                            background. <persName corresp="#p_TB1">Talhouni</persName> said that
                            while he did not know what King's <pb n="553" xml:id="pg_553"
                                facs="0581"/>reaction message would be, of course, he would give the
                            present views of the King's govt. <persName corresp="#p_TB1"
                                >Talhouni</persName> then gave a long and closely reasoned account
                            of events of the past year, culminating in the announcement of the
                            Phantom decision, which he said led him to feel there was a basic and
                            disturbing lack of balance in the relationships of the US with Israel
                            and with Jordan. He cited the suspension of budget support, the
                            protracted ban on arms shipments to Jordan, and various stands taken by
                            the US at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> as examples of the kind
                            of moves which the Jordan public could not understand and which were an
                            embarrassment and a source of mounting criticism of the King and govt by
                            all walks of life in Jordan. He emphasized he was not asking for a
                            resumption of budget support but was illustrating the kind of things
                            which had been piled one on another and made it hard for Arab friends of
                            the US. During the arms ban Jordan had been under tremendous pressure to
                            accept Soviet arms and the Soviets had indicated willingness to supply.
                            The Jordan Govt, however, had decided that the wisest course was to
                            maintain its ties with the US. He mentioned too the delivery of Skyhawks
                            to Israel while Jordan was still under the ban. Also Jordan had expected
                            a major effort by the US to help clear the way for real progress after
                            last November's <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> resolution.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>With respect to the supersonic aircraft, <persName corresp="#p_TB1"
                                >Talhouni</persName> said this opened the way to the Soviets to
                            supply more aircraft which would tend nullify whatever additional
                            security these planes were expected to give Israel. Also there was the
                            fact these would be viewed by the Arabs in the light of the use of the
                            Skyhawks supplied with modern rockets (sic) in the attack on Salt in
                            which innocent civilians had been killed. He said he was distressed by
                            the timing of the announcement and deeply concerned for the cumulative
                            effect of such actions on the US image in the area and the position of
                            the people who continue close ties with the US. Certainly up until now
                            King <persName>Hussein</persName> had been able to stand off all
                            pressures and attacks on his policy, but this was becoming increasingly
                            difficult.</item>

                            <persName corresp="#p_TB1">Talhouni</persName> said that while it was
                            not for him to suggest what US policy should be he could not escape the
                            conclusion that US interests had suffered from various actions in the
                            past year, mentioning in this connection the entry of additional Soviet
                            ships into the Mediterranean. He also expressed concern for implications
                            of the delay in ratification of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty as
                            symptomatic of US problems today.</item>

                            <persName corresp="#p_TB1">Talhouni</persName> said the press had asked
                            him to comment on the aircraft negotiations announcement and he had
                            refused just as he had refused be drawn out on the Eban speech. Touqan
                            said that they had just received a telegram from Farra in New York
                            reporting a decision of the Arab delegates at the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> to ask their governments to express to respective <pb
                                n="554" xml:id="pg_554" facs="0582"/>American Ambassadors their
                            concern and displeasure for the Phantoms announcement and to urge trade
                            unions and other institutions in the country to telegraph their protests
                            to the US and the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. <persName
                                corresp="#p_TB1">Talhouni</persName> said that Jordan obviously was
                            not going to stir up the local organizations and the street against the
                            US in such a way, but this was an example of the kind of pressures they
                            were under. <persName corresp="#p_TB1">Talhouni</persName> also
                            described the latest meeting with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                                >Nasser</persName> in which <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                                >Nasser</persName> had said that it was only on account of
                                <persName>Hussein</persName> that he had been persuaded to make a
                            public acceptance of the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> resolution.
                            This decision had, <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> said,
                            given him countless headaches with his own people and he maintained it
                            because of <persName>Hussein</persName>.</item>
                        <label>8.</label>
                        <item>After hearing <persName corresp="#p_TB1">Talhouni</persName> out, as
                            he had me, I said I would report fully his comments. I said I also wish
                            to reaffirm that I knew that the highest levels in the <gloss
                                target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> admired and appreciated the wisdom and
                            course he as well as the King had followed in this long difficult
                            period. We knew that delays and sometimes our actions resulted in
                            problems for them. These elements were inevitable in our system and the
                            complex situation with which we were dealing. With respect to budget
                            support, the facts of the fiscal situation had made the action
                            inevitable but we had tried to show our support for Jordan in other
                            ways. He should not overlook, however, the great strength of our
                            fundamental policies and our determination to carry through on these.
                            One of these policies was to work for a basic solution which would
                            establish conditions of real peace in the area. This required
                            cooperation of all. I noted the reaffirmation of our intentions in the
                            message to the King and the statements of <gloss target="#t_Amb1"
                                >Amb</gloss> Wiggins in New York.</item>
                        <label>9.</label>
                        <item>With respect to the aircraft negotiations decision, I said that
                            speaking apart from instructions and as an observer, I saw real value in
                            having cleared away an issue which had served only to confuse more basic
                            problems in our relations with the Israelis. Again stressing it was my
                            personal view I said that entry into negotiations should make it easier
                            for us to talk with the Israelis about a solution of the broader
                            problems. So long as Israel had no indication of source for replacement
                            of its losses while Soviet planes were being supplied to its neighbors,
                            Israel's preoccupation with its ultimate security prompted it to hang on
                            to every tactical advantage it had and made it unresponsive to our
                            suggestions for moves which it claimed might undermine that security. I
                            stressed I did not know the extent to which this might play a part but
                            said I thought it could be important.</item>
                        <label>10.</label>
                        <item>I closed with a renewed request for understanding of the complex
                            factors that had entered into the President's decision. I said I
                            believed they should see in our genuine efforts in New York and
                            elsewhere evidences of the real and fundamental support which we had
                            again reaffirmed to Jordan. I again referred to appreciation of the
                            wisdom <pb n="555" xml:id="pg_555" facs="0583"/>and understanding
                                <persName corresp="#p_TB1">Talhouni</persName> and his colleagues

                    </p>
                    <p>The last point is the tough one, but there's strong feeling in the Bureaus
                        that we have to tackle the Israeli missile program now or give up on it.
                        There is serious doubt, however, that the President would be willing to
                        refuse delivery of the Phantoms if the Israelis refused to give all these
                        assurances. In fact, one can even argue persuasively that we have an
                        interest in getting the Phantoms there so Israel can defend itself. At the
                        same time, there's great peril in standing back while Israel goes nuclear.
                        Even the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> just puts them 90 days away if
                        they are <pb n="556" xml:id="pg_556" facs="0584"/>otherwise prepared and
                        give notice of pulling out. I do not know how the Secretary feels about
                        going this far-though it is clear that he'd like a signature on the <gloss
                            target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Even if we decide that these should be our conditions, there is still a
                        debate over how to satisfy them. Most of the Bureau officers feel we must
                        have assurance on all points in writing specifically linked to the sale of
                        aircraft. Wally Barbour on the other hand believes it is satisfactory to get
                            <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName>'s oral assurances. He could
                        do this or the President could do it when he sees <persName corresp="#p_EL1"
                            >Eshkol</persName> at the end of the year, though this does not cover
                        the probability of <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName>'s eventual
                        replacement.</p>
                    <p>While I share everyone's uneasiness about Israel's going down the missile
                        road, I personally don't believe we can expect 50 airplanes to buy us this
                        kind of say in Israel's strategy of survival. I do think we might make a
                        case for signature of the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> and even
                        reaffirmation of Israel's nuclear assurances, but I don't see how we could
                        begin to expect Israel to close the path to missiles. I'm afraid we'll just
                        have to be content with making our opposition known.</p>
                    <p>No action required. I just thought you'd want this feel for the issue that
                        will have to be discussed with the President before Secretary <persName

                                    >Document 250</ref>.</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> had justified continued
                            Israeli presence on Tiran as military necessity, saying “even three
                            Fatah with machine guns” on Tiran could close straits to shipping.
                            Secretary had told <persName corresp="#p_AY1">Allon</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> he did not find this
                            argument convincing. <persName corresp="#p_DRP1">Davies</persName> said
                            we wished once again to take up this point. Citing distances involved,
                                <persName corresp="#p_DRP1">Davies</persName> said it was difficult
                            to see how light weapons could in any way interdict or otherwise harm
                            shipping passing through the main Enterprise Passage which
                            four-and-one-half miles away from Tiran. Only weapon that could do this
                            would be long-range flat-trajectory guns such as Soviet 122 mm. rifle,
                            and we were in position to know Saudis had nothing of this type.
                            Moreover, such weapons obviously could not be installed on island
                            without Israelis knowing about it through air surveillance. Davies said
                            in addition to these factors he wished remind <gloss target="#t_GOI1"
                                >GOI</gloss> we had King Faisal's assurance that Tiran would not be
                            militarized if Israelis left island. We had no reason believe this was
                            not firm and reliable undertaking on King's part. Argov made no comment
                            except to ask if Israeli withdrawal from Senafir had had beneficial
                            impact in Saudi Arabia. <persName corresp="#p_DRP1">Davies</persName>
                            said we had not heard that King had declared public holiday but we
                            believed Israeli action had nevertheless been helpful.</item>

                            taken to keep this matter out of press. Argov said there had been leaks
                            in past and he could give no assurances so far as Israeli press
                            concerned.</item>

                            invited <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> comments or proposals, but
                            it focused on the Israeli thesis that peace must rest on agreement
                            between the parties involved, which should be in treaty form. Israel
                            took the position that unilateral declarations or assurances by others
                            would not substitute for a direct contractual agreement. (Ibid.)</note>
                        Riad had not had time to read it and Egyptians did not know contents.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DRP1">Davies</persName> and <persName
                            corresp="#p_AALJ1">Atherton</persName> stressed that Egyptians should
                        look not at what was wrong with document but at what was right about it and
                        should remember that Eban was having trouble with the cabinet at home.
                        Khouli replied that Riad was having trouble with his cabinet too.</p>
                    <p>3. <persName>Rostow</persName> said that although he did not know contents of
                        Israeli document, delivery was significant in itself and represented fruit
                        of extensive US efforts to get Israelis adopt more accommodating position
                            <pb n="559" xml:id="pg_559" facs="0587"/>vis-a-vis Egypt. Egyptians now
                        had historical opportunity and they should respond in the most favorable
                        possible way to Israelis. We understood political problems which Egypt faced
                        but Israel faced parallel problems. We had not supported the Israeli view
                        that negotiations had to be direct, even though that position had seemed
                        logical to us. At same time we did not think it was practical to rule out
                        eventual direct confrontation between Israelis and Egyptians in signing of
                        document which could be called something other than peace treaty but which
                        would in fact establish peace not armistice, as required by Resolution of
                        Nov. 22. If present opportunity was not seized, results would be tragic for
                        all of us. It was not time to rake over past grievances but look to future.
                        We would support any settlement on which parties agreed and President's
                        phrase in his Sept. 10 speech regarding the real possibility of just and
                        dignified peace had been carefully considered and meant what it said in the
                        light of our knowledge of the parties' positions. But the parties themselves
                        would have to take responsibility. They could not simply listen and ask US
                        to do the job for them. We often heard charge that US policy was influenced
                        by domestic political considerations. This was not the case. The need for
                        peace in <gloss target="#t_ME1">ME</gloss> was one of factors in President's
                        mind in making his decision of March 31. US policy was based on US national
                        interests. We had been using all our energy and imagination to fulfill it
                        throughout this period. But we had had many disappointments.</p>
                    <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_KHS1">Khouli</persName> said Egyptians were prepared
                        for peace but past experience made them extremely suspicious. Israelis also
                        had right to be suspicious of Egypt. This highlighted necessity for
                        international role and guarantees particularly from US regarding any
                        settlement reached. <persName>Rostow</persName> said he would not entirely
                        rule out possibility of US guarantee to support agreement of the parties
                        under Resolution. The question raised far reaching issues which required
                        study. In any event, he could say at this point that we would certainly
                        support Security Council endorsement of agreement reached by the parties to
                        implement the principles of the Resolution.</p>
                    <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_KHS1">Khouli</persName> made frequent reference to
                        Phantoms and to unfortunate effect recent While House statement in this
                        regard had had on <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring Mission</persName> and
                        Arab/American relations in general. <persName>Rostow</persName> said
                        question of Phantoms had been carefully considered and Egyptians should
                        realize statement represented <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> judgment
                        of the best way to deal with tensions surrounding process of reaching peace
                        including the bargaining positions of parties and Soviet policy.
                        Overwhelming preponderance of Soviet aircraft in area was cause of real
                        concern. It could be argued that supplying Israel with more aircraft at this
                        time would make them more flexible in dealing with Arabs. If their security
                        was established through airpower they might be willing to take more risks
                            <pb n="560" xml:id="pg_560" facs="0588"/>on the ground. In this
                        connection <persName>Rostow</persName> mentioned demilitarization of Sinai.
                        Khouli unwilling discuss <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> position but
                        noted that if <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> demilitarized Sinai,
                        Israelis might seize it again, as they had occupied al-Auja.</p>
                    <p>6. Throughout conversation Khouli kept reverting to question US-<gloss
                            target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> relations which he said were essential to
                        both countries. He called attention to statement by Riad in October 10 news
                        conference that <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> was very interested in
                        resumption relations but US would first have to establish its impartiality
                        by agreeing that Israel had committed aggression and by supporting
                        withdrawal of Israel from all occupied territories. Khouli said that in his
                        recent election campaign for ASU he had been struck by fact that fellaheen
                        in all Egyptian villages kept asking why US was enemy of Egypt. He had not
                        been back to Egypt since the White House announcement regarding the Phantoms
                        but he expected an increase in the feeling of the Egyptian populace that the
                        US was against them. <persName>Rostow</persName> pointed out that Nasser had
                        told <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> he fully realized
                        responsibility for absence of relations was his, not ours. We believed in
                        having diplomatic relations with <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and
                        wished to have good relations with that country. Our policy was not
                        pro-Israel, or pro-Arab, but pro-US. We had pursued it steadily, agreeing
                        with Arabs on some points, with Israel on others. On certain issues, like
                        Jerusalem, nobody agreed with us. The problem now was to make peace under
                        the Resolution, which we supported. We understood the <gloss
                            target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> position to be that the Resolution required
                        a package deal, linking withdrawal to all other issues. We agreed with that
                        position.</p>
                    <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_HPT1">Hart</persName> commented that he knew many
                        Americans who were unable understand Egyptian actions against US, such as
                        burning of libraries, speeches about drinking sea, etc. If Egyptians
                        interested in good relations, a new leaf would have to be turned over.
                        Khouli took it in good spirit.<note n="4" xml:id="d282fn4">At <gloss

                    <p>The British Ambassador said that he had instructions to talk to the Secretary
                        at this time, particularly as the Secretary was scheduled to receive the
                        Israeli Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Abba Eban</persName>
                        tomorrow. The Foreign Office believed that the <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                            >UAR</gloss>'s reply to the Israeli document,<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d283fn2">See <ref target="#d282fn3">footnote 3, Document
                                282</ref>.</note> received through <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                            >Jarring</persName>, was rather discouraging. The British understood
                        that the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> has asked two questions of the
                        Israelis: (a) would they accept the November Resolution and state their
                        willingness to implement it; (b) what exactly did they mean by “secure
                        boundaries”. When conveying this to Lord Caradon (UKUN) on October 20,
                            <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> said the Israelis would
                        not like the reply and he wondered “where do we go from here.”</p>
                    <p>Sir <persName corresp="#p_DSP1">Patrick</persName> went on to say that the
                        Foreign Office did not know if the Israelis have passed a similar document
                        through <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> for the Jordanians.
                        The Jordanian Foreign Minister Rifai did not appear to have any new
                        instructions following his visit to London to see King
                            <persName>Hussein</persName>. Since his return, Rifai told the British
                        in New York that the Jordanians were waiting for acceptance by the Israelis
                        of the Resolution and agreement to implement it, together with a precise
                        definition of what the Israelis meant by “secure boundaries”.</p>
                    <p>Rifai had added that, if by these boundaries the Israelis meant acquisition
                        of territory from Jordan, all bets were off. He also had said that Jordan
                        would wish to have the population of the West Bank free and available for
                        consultation before they could take decisions on an overall settlement with
                        Israel.</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Office believed the <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>
                        mission was now in considerable danger. Unless the Israelis were prepared
                        soon to be considerably more forthcoming and to take what they would regard
                        as risks <pb n="562" xml:id="pg_562" facs="0590"/>in pursuit of a
                        settlement, the brighter prospects of a fortnight ago would fade. Prime
                        Minister Wilson had sent a message to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EL1"
                            >Eshkol</persName> to this effect.</p>
                    <p>Sir <persName corresp="#p_DSP1">Patrick</persName> said several things were
                        required from the Israelis in the near future: (a) a public commitment,
                        either directly or through <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>, of
                        their willingness to implement the Security Council Resolution and to use
                        the good offices of <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> to reach
                        agreement on why this should be done; (b) to give <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                            >Jarring</persName> an indication of their ideas for a settlement with
                        Jordan. In light of Eban's visit, the Foreign Office suggested that the US
                        apply pressures along the foregoing lines. Perhaps the President could send
                        a message to Eshkol. The Ambassador said there was a division in the Israeli
                        Cabinet on these questions. They should be warned of the dangers if the
                        present opportunities were allowed to lapse because of their unwillingness
                        to take any risk.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary replied that this presented two problems as far as the <gloss
                            target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> was concerned.</p>
                    <list>
                        <label>(1)</label>
                        <item>We understood that the Egyptian response to what the Israelis gave
                                <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> was inadequate.
                            However the Secretary said there was no good in pressing the Israelis if
                            they received a rejection from the Arabs. Who would put pressure on the
                            Arabs or the Egyptians? We could not. It seemed that now the Arabs might
                            even be opposed to indirect talks; this left us in a difficult position
                            as we had something to do with Israel's willingness to talk
                            substantively to <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>. Our
                            leverage on the Israelis was diminished by the lack of an Arab response
                            to recent Israeli moves.</item>

                        <item>Regarding implementation, we did not see how any government could
                            agree to implementation as interpreted by another. Any government had a
                            right to say it would implement any particular proposal but that there
                            would be clarification in the course of discussions. This Resolution was
                            not self-executing; every word needed to be clarified. The Arabs were
                            not only trying to define the words, but they were trying to deny to the
                            Israelis the opportunity of clarification.</item>

                    <p>Sir <persName corresp="#p_DSP1">Patrick</persName> said he understood the
                        Secretary's view, but the British wanted the Israelis to say publicly that
                        they were prepared to implement the Resolution and to use the good offices
                        of <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> to see how it could be
                        done. He believed this was a step forward. Sir <persName corresp="#p_DSP1"
                            >Patrick</persName> reiterated that it was in the interests of the
                        Israelis not to lose <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said the Israelis were interested in the need to keep <persName
                            corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> in business. In fact, this was a
                        lever which the US had used on the Israelis. The Secretary said that, in his
                        talks with the Egyptian Foreign Minister Riad, the latter was noncommittal
                        on all points other than withdrawal. He asked Sir <persName
                            corresp="#p_DSP1">Patrick</persName> if there was any possibility of
                        anybody applying any influence in Cairo. Sir <persName corresp="#p_DSP1"
                            >Patrick</persName> replied that they would see what could be done in
                        that regard. The Secretary reiterated that he would keep all this in mind
                        when talking to Eban tomorrow.</p>

                    <p>The President reported that he had made his decision on Phantoms in principle
                        last January. He planned to move ahead if the Russians kept on supplying
                        arms to the Arabs; if the Russians proved unwilling to talk with us about
                        regional arms control; if Israel were helpful in seeking peace; and if
                        Israel accepted the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>The President said that he was not making the question of the <gloss
                            target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> a formal condition, but Eban should know
                        the very strong feelings in the American government on this matter. He then
                        read to Eban Sec. <persName corresp="#p_CCM1">Clifford</persName>'s view
                        (Tab A),<note n="2" xml:id="d284fn2">Not printed. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CCM1">Clifford</persName> expressed the view that the

                            warheads. <persName corresp="#p_CCM1">Clifford</persName> felt that the
                            President's concern could lay the foundation for the Department of State
                            to insist that the missile development be stopped as a condition for
                            Israel receiving 50 Phantom aircraft.</note> transmitted to the

                            President, expressing <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s
                            concern about the Israeli missile program and the importance of Israeli
                            adherence to the Non-Proliferation Treaty. A copy of the memorandum is

                    </p>
                    <p>Eban said that the U.S. Government appeared to have an “exaggerated idea” of
                        Israel's nuclear capability. The President said he should talk about this
                        matter with Sec. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and Sec.

                                    conversation in his memoirs. According to Eban,
                                        <persName>Johnson</persName> began by affirming his
                                    intention to supply Phantoms to Israel and asked Eban to tell
                                    Eshkol that Lyndon <persName>Johnson</persName> had kept his
                                    word. According to Eban, the President said that he had
                                    discussed the issue of providing Phantoms with <persName>Richard
                                        Nixon</persName> and Hubert Humphrey and both candidates had
                                    agreed to honor his commitment. He also said that both NIXON and
                                    Humphrey could be counted on to keep faith with the commitment
                                    to Israel's security and independence. (Abba Eban, <hi

                    <p rend="flushleft">Dear Mr. Prime Minister:</p>
                    <p>I have appreciated your recent letters, and I had a good talk with Foreign
                        Minister Eban yesterday. He will be reporting in detail our strong feelings
                        on the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, but I wish to write you this
                        personal note to be sure our emphasis on that issue does not obscure a
                        larger point.</p>
                    <p>I know you face a difficult series of meetings this week and wish to send you
                        this word of encouragement.</p>
                    <p>I am deeply concerned, as you know, Mr. Prime Minister, about Israel's
                        future, and I understand how strongly some of your colleagues feel that
                        Israel's future can best be guaranteed by military means and expanded
                        borders alone. It is so much easier to argue in terms of military balance
                        and lines on a map than it is to argue the case for political compromise.
                        But our own experience has proved that real peace is not found alone on the
                        walls of a fortress—or under the umbrella of air power—or behind a nuclear
                        shield.</p>
                    <p>Every American President knows that our most secure borders are the open
                        borders with Mexico and Canada. That day may not be close for Israel with
                        the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, but it could be close with
                        Jordan.</p>
                    <p>I feel so strongly about the irrationality of trying to make peace by force
                        alone that I must urge you to resist those who find it easier to risk
                        Israel's future on today's expanded boundaries than to reach out for real
                        peace. From my own difficult personal decision last March, I can say with
                        feeling that it is not easy to lead a nation toward a necessary peace
                        without jeopardizing hard-won gains and the future those gains have earned.
                        But I can also say that it is worth reasonable risks, measured compromise,
                        and personal pain.</p>
                    <p>I do not presume to say what your Government should do. But I pray that you
                        and your colleagues will find the courage to seize this moment of
                        opportunity so that peace may be “within thy walls.”</p>
                    <p>I look forward to seeing you later this year.</p>
                    <p>Sincerely,</p>

                                government to make a constructive contribution to the search for a
                                lasting and peaceful settlement to the crisis that has been a matter
                                of deep concern to all of us.</p>
                            <p>I have asked Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SHM1">Symmes</persName>
                                to convey to you upon his return to Amman my warmest personal

                    <p>260399. 1. In course of Eban call on Secretary October 22 (Hart, Atherton,
                        Rabin and Argov also present), Eban summarized present position with respect
                        to negotiations with Jordan and <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> as
                        follows: <list>

                            <item>Jordan had indicated to <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                                    >Jarring</persName> that it would favor joint meetings with
                                Israel under his auspices but first wanted to receive informally
                                more specific idea of how Israel sees future boundaries. There was
                                “mutual feeling” that it desirable to wait week or so in effort come
                                closer on substance before moving forward on procedural problems.
                                Eban said he would see what could be done during forthcoming trip to
                                Israel to overcome obstacles Jordan still faces before entering
                                joint meetings.<note n="2" xml:id="d287fn2">In a separate

                                    contacts. He described the informal contacts with the Jordanians
                                    as serious and pragmatic, but requiring additional time to
                                    achieve agreement. (Telegram 259849 to Tel Aviv, October 22;

                                for peace as Jordan had, which made it possible to give <gloss
                                    target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> idea of Israeli terms. In response
                                to Israeli memorandum spelling out <gloss target="#t_GOI1"
                                    >GOI</gloss> interpretation of Security Council Resolution and
                                making clear Israel wants formal end to conflict, not absence of
                                war, <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> has provided provocative
                                and propagandistic reply, inter alia demanding Israeli withdrawal
                                from all territories. <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> had not
                                said what it means by peace and wanted Israel to renounce concept of
                                settlement through “agreement.” This Israel would not do.
                                “Agreement” was Israel's “safety catch.” Other countries agreed with
                                    <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> that this represented
                                responsible position.</item>

                    </p>
                    <p>2. Secretary said he saw merit in this position and had so told Arabs with
                        whom he had spoken. Secretary continued that we had found Israeli memorandum
                        to <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> constructive so far as it
                        went. It had failed, however, to get into territorial question. It would
                        help if Israel could inject this point into dialogue in ways which made
                        clear it had no designs on <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> territory,
                        while making clear, for example, Israeli <pb n="567" xml:id="pg_567"
                            facs="0595"/>view that special arrangements needed for Sharm al Shaykh.
                        Unless there was movement in discussions with <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                            >UAR</gloss>, chances for success with Jordan would be slim.</p>
                    <p>3. Eban agreed on importance of maintaining dialogue with <gloss
                            target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. Israel had considered providing <persName
                            corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> with map for <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                            >UAR</gloss> but preferred deal in concepts—e.g., need for Israeli
                        presence at Sharm al Shaykh. Israel wanted to talk to <gloss
                            target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> but it would not provide channel. <gloss
                            target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> would have to face this issue at some time,
                        however. If Israel gave its territorial terms to <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                            >Jarring</persName>, Riad would simply reject them. If parties were at
                        same table, Riad would have to explain his objections. Israel would reply to
                        latest <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> memorandum in constructive spirit
                        but, if <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> wanted to discuss lines on maps,
                        it must overcome inhibitions about meeting with Israel.</p>
                    <p>4. Re Sharm al Shaykh, Secretary asked if Israel had considered idea of four
                        power presence there, including Soviets. <persName corresp="#p_EA1"
                            >Eban</persName> said this would “globalize” problem; we should give
                        careful thought to whether it was wise to provide Soviets statutory position
                        in area, particularly in light of their record and their actions in
                        Czechoslovakia. Secretary said Soviets were already in Middle East and would
                        stay there whether we liked it or not; perhaps small Soviet contingent at
                        Sharm al Shaykh with equal US, French and British contingents would not pose
                        serious problem.</p>
                    <p>5. Re Soviet position in general, Secretary said while he could not speak for
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, he had impression Soviets
                        considered arguments about procedure “silly,” had no objections to use of
                        Suez Canal by Israeli flag vessels and did not care about refugees.</p>

                    <p>Begin summary: During meeting with Foreign Minister Eban October 22,
                        Secretary pressed Eban hard about Israel's nuclear weapons and missile
                        plans, stressing that this was matter affecting our fundamental
                        relationship. Eban repeated standard Israeli position, emphasizing that
                        Israel had not made decision to become nuclear power and that deployment of
                        strategic missiles by Israel was not imminent. Secretary said <gloss
                            target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> needed more concrete assurances re <gloss
                            target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> nuclear intentions-i.e., Israeli
                        participation in <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>. Eban and Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> pressed for early start on
                        technical negotiations for the sale of F-4 Phantoms. Secretary said we felt
                        initial discussions should be held on political side, that Asst. Sec. Hart
                        would be his representative for those discussions and that he hoped Eban
                        would bring back new word on Israeli position re <gloss target="#t_NPT1"
                            >NPT</gloss> when he returned from Israel next week. Initial session

                            bilateral Israeli statements to us (e.g., Israel will not be a first to
                            introduce nuclear weapons in area and Israel is not a military nuclear

                            other countries in better security position than Israel were also taking
                            time to study problem. Furthermore Israel had additional problem of its
                            lack of position in <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>Secretary said we had reason to believe Israel involved in nuclear
                            weapons and missile programs. Such missiles were for use with nuclear
                            weapons not high explosives. These were matters of utmost seriousness
                            affecting our fundamental relationship, and we must have clarification
                            with respect to them. For Israel to develop nuclear weapons would (a)
                            confront us with question of whether we were serious about <gloss
                                target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>, which we are and (b) raise questions

                        <item>Secretary said that we could not see how nuclear weapons would solve
                            Israeli strategic problems. Israel's problems with <gloss
                                target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> inspections were something that could
                            be discussed. We wanted something more concrete, however, about Israel's
                            nuclear intentions and could not be reassured unless Israel participated
                            in <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> as matter of fundamental
                            policy.</item>

                        <item>In response Eban's assertion that Israel had not decided to become
                            nuclear power and had not decided not to sign <gloss target="#t_NPT1"
                                >NPT</gloss>, Secretary <pb n="569" xml:id="pg_569" facs="0597"

                            connection Secretary noted <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> was
                            signatory. If country was part way down road to producing nuclear
                            weapons, we took little comfort from statement that it was not nuclear
                            power.</item>

                        <item>Re missile development, Eban said Secretary exaggerated Israeli
                            position which was as stated to us in 1967—i.e., Israel was far from
                            being in situation of having operative missiles ready for deployment.
                            Given slow down due strains in French-Israeli relations, that stage
                            could not be reached before 1970. Stating that missile development in
                            Middle East arose in non-nuclear context, Eban said Israel could not
                            ignore what was happening in <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> which
                            continued to try even though progress not swift. Israeli missile
                            activity was function of what <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> was
                            doing. It would be difficult for Israel to terminate its program in
                            absence similar action by <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>.</item>
                        <label>7.</label>
                        <item>Eban continued that in foreseeable future Israel's central
                            preoccupation would be defense and security. For Israel, very existence
                            depended on a few hundred airplanes. <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
                            has thus welcomed President's October nine statement re Phantom
                            negotiations which had important psychological effect. Given view of
                            some in <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> military that <gloss
                                target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> could seek military solution or at
                            least peace through intimidation in 1969-70, President's announcement on
                            Phantoms would not only help Israel's security position but further
                            prospects for peace.</item>

                        <item>Secretary said he remained concerned about arms spiral. Would not
                            Soviets respond by providing additional aircraft to Arabs? Eban said he
                            believed <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> already receiving all
                            military equipment it could absorb. Furthermore no one could say <gloss
                                target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> responsible for escalating arms spiral
                            since (a) Soviets had been probed without success re arms limitation and
                            (b) President's announcement had come after Soviet re-supply of <gloss
                                target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. This connection, Eban noted that Arab
                            reaction had not been violent. Secretary replied that form of
                            announcement—i.e., President had instructed Secretary to initiate
                            negotiations and report back to him—had helped soften Arab
                            reaction.</item>
                        <label>9.</label>
                        <item>Eban said he understood President's announcement constituted decision
                            in principle and that it was assumed in area that negotiations would be
                            concerned with technical details. Would it be possible to open
                            negotiations today? If so who would represent Secretary?</item>
                        <label>10.</label>
                        <item>Secretary replied that negotiations would be handled for <gloss
                                target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> by Assistant Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_HPT1">Hart</persName>. Meanwhile he hoped Eban would

                                >NPT</gloss> when he returned from Israel next week. In response
                            Eban's comment that it would be bad to link these two questions,
                            Secretary asked how we would assure that Phantoms would not carry
                            nuclear weapons. Amb. Rabin suggested handling this problem as we had in
                            A-4 Skyhawk sale. Secretary said this question could be discussed
                            further with <persName corresp="#p_HPT1">Hart</persName>.</item>

                        <item>Secretary asked what time frame Israelis were thinking of for F-4
                            deliveries. <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> noted that
                            Israel had preferred mid-1969, but that discussions last January had
                            been in terms of beginning of 1970. Eban said Israel would be pleased if
                            deliveries could be expedited, noting Israel had originally requested
                            Phantoms in addition to Mirages now embargoed by France and that, in
                            January, <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> had still thought Mirages

                            reached. Secretary said we felt it necessary to have preliminary talks
                            on political side-perhaps by end of week. If <gloss target="#t_GOI1"
                                >GOI</gloss> felt it needed bring experts to Washington to discuss

                            question could be taken up with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HPT1"
                                >Hart</persName>. Eban suggested as first step we should review A-4

                            October 23 since he was returning to Israel that night and could then

                            declined, asking if <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> and related

                            Noting that Secretary had said political discussions should occur first,

                            Eban in Washington, we have urged Israelis to be specific as possible,
                            particularly on withdrawal-territorial question, in their next response
                            to <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> document. Our urging is based on
                            several considerations: (a) <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                                >Jarring</persName> believes next Israeli response will be critical
                            and decisive; (b) It may well determine whether <persName
                                corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> continues or whether matter will
                            revert to Security Council at early date; (c) <gloss target="#t_GOI1"
                                >GOI</gloss> response will have an important effect and interaction
                            on Jordanian aspect of settlement. If prospects for substantive dialogue

                            most unlikely Jordanians would feel free to proceed in their exchanges
                            with Israelis, by whatever means. This latter point particularly
                            important and is one which Israelis seemed to appreciate in our

                            reply we would consider minimum required by present circumstances. We
                            realize that last <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> reply was very
                            inadequate and that in light strongly held Israeli view <gloss
                                target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> not ready to make peace, we may be
                            rebuffed. On other hand, we are sure you appreciate that while present
                            juncture not particularly favorable, atmosphere likely to be even less

                        <item>Statement below should be given to Eban personally. Eban should be
                            told that these are informal and illustrative thoughts, in large measure
                            based on statements which he and other Israeli officials have made to us
                            in past. It would fully protect Israel since it includes “safety catch”
                            of agreement and “peace.” It would turn tables on <gloss
                                target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and not give <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> opportunity to knife
                                <persName>Hussein</persName>. This is no blue-print, for we have
                            none. But if Eban finds it helpful with his Cabinet colleagues to
                            identify them as American thoughts, he may do so. We know he understands
                            fully that if <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> response to <gloss
                                target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> is inadequate not only could it cripple
                                <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> Mission, but more
                            important it likely to weaken <persName>Hussein</persName>'s resolve and
                            capacity to pursue discussions with Israelis. We agree with Eban's
                            desire <pb n="572" xml:id="pg_572" facs="0600"/>to try to firm up as
                            specific a deal as possible with Jordanians through informal contacts
                            before discussions of substance revert to Rifai and <persName
                                corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>. Our thoughts therefore deal
                            exclusively with <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> response to <gloss
                                target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> through <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                                >Jarring</persName>, though we also agree with Eban's intention to
                            deal at subsequent stage with Jordanian aspect as well.</item>

                            now, we won't have a chance later.” (Johnson Library, National Security

                            on instructions, Ambassador Barbour saw Eban on October 26 and reported
                            that his reaction was neither sharp nor adverse. Eban was somewhat
                            concerned not to reveal Israel's entire negotiating position to the

                            accepted the argument that the Israeli response should be substantive
                            rather than polemical. Eban noted that he did not anticipate returning
                            to New York until after a scheduled Cabinet meeting on October 30. He
                            observed that if Riad was interested in negotiating a settlement, he
                            should be willing to delay his departure from New York until after Eban
                            had returned. (Telegram 5842 from Tel Aviv, October 27; ibid.) The

                    <p>Abe Feinberg called last night to say the Israelis are up in arms because
                        Parker <persName corresp="#p_HPT1">Hart</persName> had apparently linked the
                        Phantoms and the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> after you and the
                        Secretary had stopped just short of linking them.</p>
                    <p>I called Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> who told me the
                        following: The Secretary had not linked the <gloss target="#t_NPT1"
                            >NPT</gloss> and the Phantoms but had told Eban that he wished <persName
                            corresp="#p_HPT1">Hart</persName> to discuss certain political questions
                        with <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> before technical
                        discussions on the planes began. <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1"
                            >Rabin</persName> was leaving for Israel the following afternoon.
                            <persName corresp="#p_HPT1">Hart</persName> told him the one thing we
                        were prepared to go into with <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName>
                        on that short notice was International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards,
                        which Eban had said he had reservations about. <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1"
                            >Rabin</persName> said he wasn't prepared to discuss that; he just
                        wanted to discuss planes. So he and Hart made a date for 3:00 p.m., October
                        30, the day after <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> and Eban
                        come back. <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName>'s line is: The
                            <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> and the planes are two separate
                        issues; let's get on with the planes.</p>
                    <p>I told Feinberg that neither you nor the Secretary had made the <gloss
                            target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> a condition for the Phantoms but you
                        considered the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> of great importance.</p>
                    <p>Feinberg apparently told this to Argov who cabled <persName
                            corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> that there was “no condition
                        precedent” to the sale of Phantoms. (Argov is <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1"
                            >Rabin</persName>'s deputy.)</p>
                    <p>This morning, Argov called me to ask whether he could today supplement his
                        last night's message with another saying that a date has now been set for
                        actual consultations on the Phantoms. He says that the Israeli press is now
                        saying we have linked the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> and Phantoms
                        and that this will put Eshkol on the spot in the Cabinet. He'd like to put
                        Eban in a position to knock these critics by saying (a) there's no condition
                        and (b) what's more <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> is taking
                        technical consultants back with him to begin detailed negotiations.</p>
                    <pb n="574" xml:id="pg_574" facs="0602"/>
                    <p>If we want to wind up the Phantom negotiations promptly, as you indicated,
                        that would make sense. But it would mean working the <gloss target="#t_NPT1"
                            >NPT</gloss> on a separate track. The Israelis are mounting this
                        reaction deliberately to press us to separate the Phantoms and the <gloss
                            target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>. Giving them the kind of answer Argov wants
                        would de-couple the two and take off the heat on the <gloss target="#t_NPT1"
                            >NPT</gloss> that you and the Secretary generated.</p>
                    <p>I can respond to Argov in one of two ways, depending on how you and the
                        Secretary wish to play this:</p>
                    <list>
                        <label>1.</label>
                        <item>We could give Argov a date for the beginning of technical talks—a date
                            several days after <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName>'s
                            return so that we can at least hear what he has to say on the <gloss
                                target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> before the technical talks even though
                            we'd be committed to begin them.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>I could tell Argov: We have set no conditions. However, the Israelis
                            themselves have told us the Phantoms would make it easier for them to

                            agreed to demilitarization on understanding it would be reciprocal.

                        <item>Finally, he pointed out that in his October 19 memorandum to <persName
                                corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>, <gloss target="#t_FonMin1"
                                >FonMin</gloss> Riad had said Israeli declaration of readiness to
                            implement resolution and withdraw its forces “would lead to achievement
                            of peace in Middle East”. He said this was response to our urgings that
                                <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> give indication it ready for
                            “peace” and not just “political solution”. He could assure us Riad meant
                            what he said and that <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> was sincerely
                            anxious for peace. There had been no progress to date, however. <gloss
                                target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> had shown its hand and made specific

                            Israelis had ignored. He did not know whether Riad could remain in New
                            York under these conditions. He had been there a month, largely as
                            result urgings Ambassador Ball. There had been no progress, and now Eban
                            had gone off to Israel. Were Arabs supposed to sit cooling their heels
                            forever? In separate conversation he said Riad <pb n="576"

                            regarding demilitarization but did not comment beyond saying hoped
                            settlement would ensure security both Israel and Arab states. Regarding
                            linkage of Canal and refugees, <persName corresp="#p_DRP1"
                                >Davies</persName> said we hoped Egyptians would not react in such
                            serious fashion each time we made suggestion to them. Bergus had merely
                            been drawing to their attention legal aspects of problem which they
                            should not overlook. We had been just as frank in calling to attention
                            of Israelis certain flaws in their legal position. In so doing we trying
                            to help parties move towards settlement, which all of us wanted. We were
                            not trying separate refugee issue from package. It was Egyptians who
                            seemed to be separating it and Canal issue from rest of package,
                            particularly in Fonmin's Oct 1 conversation with Secretary. We thought
                            that was mistake and that there should be no special linkage of this
                            sort between any of the separate components of resolution.</item>

                            <persName corresp="#p_DRP1">Davies</persName> said we pleased to note
                            Riad had spoken of peace in his memorandum to <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                                >Jarring</persName>. He would call this positive note to attention
                            of others. He hoped at same time that Egyptians would concentrate on
                            positive aspects of Israeli position, and would realize that Israelis
                            had domestic political problem which necessitated extreme caution on
                            Eban's part. Eban had gone home for consultations. Hopefully he would
                            return with more flexibility. We hoped Israelis would respond to
                            Egyptian position in positive fashion and that Egyptians would
                            re-ciprocate. All of us should put our shoulders to wheel and

                            serious tactical error for him to leave on 29th. He should at least wait
                            until Eban returned and find out what latter had to say. Riad had waited
                            18 months, it would be mistake not to wait few days longer. If Egyptians

                    <p>You asked what is going on in Syria. This morning we have a spate of
                            reports<note n="2" xml:id="d293fn2">A list at the end of the memorandum
                            indicates that the following reports were attached: telegram 13810 from
                            Beirut, October 28; [<hi rend="italic">5 document numbers not
                                declassified</hi>].</note> on a showdown that seems to have taken
                        place about October 23-24. On the basis of this third-hand information from
                        Damascus, the intelligence community's best guess is that:</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister Zuayyin's policy of cooperation with the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and local Communists went too far for
                        Defense Minister Asad who decided to oust Zuayyin. Baath Party leader
                        Jadid—the most important figure in Damascus—thought that if Asad succeeded
                        he would be too powerful a rival and decided to stop him. An equally good
                        explanation is that Asad moved against Zuayyin to be in a position to oust
                        Jadid. In any case, Asad and Jadid had a showdown, and our sources in Beirut
                        are reporting that Asad—backed by the army—won. So far there has been
                        nothing official from Damascus to indicate a struggle, much less the
                            winner.<note n="3" xml:id="d293fn3">On October 29 the Syrian Baath Party
                            announced the formation of a new Cabinet headed by Prime Minister Nur al
                            Din al Atasi who replaced Prime Minister Yusuf Zuayyin. The Embassy in
                            Beirut assessed the change in government as “the most fundamental change
                            in the character of the present Syrian regime since it came to power
                            February 1966.” The Embassy noted that the Syrian military had emerged
                            as prominent and that Defense Minister General Hafiz al Asad was the
                            second most important member of the Cabinet. (Telegram 13880 from
                            Beirut, October 29; National Archives and Records Administration, <gloss

                            In a later analysis of the governmental change in Syria, the Embassy
                            concluded that Baath Party Secretary-General Salah al Jadid had been
                            forced to accommodate Asad's expanded power and role, but that there had
                            not necessarily been a split between the two long-time political allies.
                            (Airgram A-1446 from Beirut, November 18; ibid.)</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>If Asad won, Syria might move away from the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                            >USSR</gloss> slightly, but it would still be the most radical Arab
                        nation. They might heat up the border with Israel, but they're more likely
                        to continue showing restraint in view of their obvious shortcomings. If
                        Jadid won, the pro-Soviets would be likely to move Syria even farther left.
                        Another possibility is that fighting among the Baath radicals will give the
                        exiled Baath moderates <pb n="579" xml:id="pg_579" facs="0607"/>and their
                        Iraqi friends an opening, but the moderates are moderate only by

                            including Eshkol and Dayan, have demonstrated a willingness to meet

                        tomorrow, 30 October. Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HPT1"

                        with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> of Israel.</p>
                    <p>The threshold issue is whether our negotiators have authority to impose any
                        political conditions on the sale of the F-4s or whether all that is to be
                        negotiated are the technical details. The second is, assuming that
                        conditions can be imposed, what these should be. Preliminary discussions
                        between the President and Foreign Minister Abba Eban and Secretary <persName

                    <p>As to the first issue we feel that the President's direction to open
                        negotiations does <hi rend="italic">not</hi> mean that we must agree to
                        provide the Phantoms unconditionally. The oral messages conveyed from Prime
                        Minister <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName> and other Israeli
                        officials are to the effect that they understand the sale of Phantoms to be
                        unconnected to the issue of the Non-Proliferation Treaty or any other
                        political question. In our view, we should not accept this position and
                        should instead make clear at the outset of negotiations that the sale of the
                        Phantoms will be contingent upon our satisfaction with Israeli assurances on
                        matters affecting our own national security. Authority for our negotiators
                        to take this position should be obtained from the President.</p>

                    <p>Reports we have as to the President's discussions with Prime Minister Eshkol
                        the first of this year show that the President agreed only to keep the sale
                        of Phantoms to Israel under review and to put ourselves in a position where,
                        if an affirmative decision were to be made by the end of the year, we could
                        begin to supply Phantoms in quantities of two or three per month beginning
                        January of 1970. The announcement of October 9th that we would begin to
                        negotiate with Israel on this sale did not constitute an undertaking to
                        consummate the transaction unconditionally.</p>
                    <p>Even more important, any agreement with a foreign government is subject to
                        modification in accordance with developments affecting the security of the
                        United States. [<hi rend="italic">3 lines of source text not
                            declassified</hi>] This possession of a nuclear missile by Israel would
                        be of no value to that country unless the fact were known to its Arab
                        neighbors. If this fact were to become known, there is every likelihood that
                        the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and possibly other Arab countries
                        would request and receive Soviet nuclear missiles stationed on their soil
                        under Soviet control. At a minimum, this development would lead to increased
                        Soviet penetration and influence among the Arab countries and the complete
                        polarization of the area. The responsibility for Israel's nuclear weapons
                        would generally be charged to us, particularly after the sale of Phantoms
                        has made us virtually Israel's only major source of arms supply.</p>
                    <p>For the future, the consequences of nuclear weapons in the Middle East could
                        be calamitous. There can be no assurance that Israel's possession of
                        strategic missiles would deter the Arab states, particularly if they have
                        Soviet nuclear missiles as an offset. We must at least contemplate the
                        possibility that, faced with a massive Arab attack, Israel might launch a
                        pre-emptive nuclear strike. A retaliatory attack, however limited, would
                        destroy Israel and face us with totally unacceptable alternatives. The first
                        of these, a nuclear strike by the United States, is almost unthinkable. If
                        directed against the Soviet Union, it would lead inexorably to all-out
                        nuclear war. If directed against an Arab state, it would virtually compel
                        Soviet retaliation against U.S. territory, particularly in view of the fact
                        that Israel would have been the first to resort to nuclear arms.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, the inability of the United States to respond to the
                        destruction of Israel by Soviet missiles would damage incalculably our world
                        position and our foreign policy objectives. We would have shown ourselves
                        powerless to protect or even avenge a country for which we have been the
                        principal sponsor and champion. I doubt that the West Germans could retain
                        any confidence in our nuclear deterrent. Their most likely recourse would be
                        an accommodation with the Soviet Union. <gloss target="#t_NATO1"

                            followed. General <persName corresp="#p_HBGM1">Hod</persName> was here
                            for this purpose and undoubtedly additional experts would be needed.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> said he had hoped that
                            U.S. would inform him in today's discussion that political decision had
                            been taken to supply fifty F-4s and that immediate detailed technical
                            discussions would follow. What stage of negotiations were we now in?
                            Hart said we were at the stage of having asked the Israelis for a draft

                                In an October 31 memorandum to Rostow, Saunders summarized the
                                Israeli draft as follows: “places the order for 50 planes and
                                requests that we try to deliver some in early 1969; refers to Eban's
                                paper of October 28 reaffirming Israel's ‘intention not to be the
                                first to <hi rend="italic">introduce</hi> nuclear weapons into the
                                area’ and agrees, accordingly, that the Phantoms won't carry these
                                weapons.” Saunders found the Israeli proposal disappointing: “This
                                is much less than we have been talking about. It doesn't get to
                                Israel's not <hi rend="italic">producing</hi> nuclear weapons. It
                                doesn't touch missile production.” (Johnson Library, National

                                6/68-11/68) In a similar assessment of the Israeli draft, <persName

                                draft posed the question of whether to try to get, in the context of
                                the F-4 negotiations, assurances from Israel concerning the <gloss

                        recording a statement—left him in the position of being the old hawk who
                        must have proposed it. C said he had done it in accordance with what the
                        Pres had said. A one-minute statement on TV and given to the reporters which
                        is fair and is absolutely the rule. He and <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1"
                            >Wheeler</persName> had had a backgrounder.</p>

                    <p>Sec said he had had two or three talks with the Pres on Phantoms. He is
                        strongly opposed to twisting arms on the nuclear thing in connection with
                        Phantoms. Doesn't want them linked. When Sec brought up A-4's and tanks,
                        Pres said they had already gotten this from us. Sec said Pres doesn't buy it
                        at all. C said the problem falls in our area more than theirs. C said we
                        know they have gotten an operational missile from the French. [<hi
                            rend="italic">2-1/2 lines of source text not declassified</hi>] This is
                        the road to disaster. The Soviets will never let them have this in the
                        Middle East. Sovs must know it now. They will send in Sov contingents and
                        set up atomic weapons in Arab nations. It will be the most dangerous area in
                        the world. Sec says he has a directive and C may want to raise it with the
                        Pres. Sec asked about delivery on the Phantoms. C said he thought it was
                        1970. Sec said they (Israelis) say early 1969. C said Nitze and Warnke were
                        with him and their clear understanding is 1970. C said he would talk to the
                        Pres again. Sec suggested sending word to <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1"
                            >Rabin</persName> that there was agreement in principle and they should
                        send someone to the Pentagon to work out things and go on from there. C said
                        they wouldn't want to do that. Sec said the Air Force man who was at the
                        Ranch is in town and is prepared to do it. C said to send him over.<note

                    <p>Yesterday, November 1, 1968, the Secretary of State, instead of negotiating
                        anything with the Israelis, instructed Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DRP1"
                            >Rodger P. Davies</persName> to <pb n="587" xml:id="pg_587" facs="0615"
                        />inform Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> that the
                        American Government was prepared in principle to accede to the Israeli
                        request for Phantoms and that they should get in touch with Defense “to set
                        up technical discussions.” In the attached memorandum of Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DRP1">Davies</persName>,<note n="2" xml:id="d300fn2">See
                                <ref target="#d299fn2">footnote 2, Document 299</ref>.</note>
                        General <persName corresp="#p_HBGM1">Hod</persName>'s name is used as the
                        one to contact us, but Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DRP1">Davies</persName>
                        admits that <persName corresp="#p_HBGM1">Hod</persName>'s name was not
                        included in Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s instructions to
                        him. <persName corresp="#p_DRP1">Davies</persName> also tells us that Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said that we should get from
                        the Israelis no less than we have gotten in the past.</p>
                    <p>I therefore seek your authorization to negotiate with the Israelis on the
                        basis that an agreement in principle leaves ample room for us to require
                        assurances from the Israelis with respect to matters which are vital to the
                        national security of the United States, and specifically much harder
                        assurances with respect to strategic missiles and nuclear weapons than we
                        have received in the past. These were only: (1) that Israel will not be the
                        first to introduce nuclear weapons into the area, and (b) they would not use
                        the A-4 aircraft to carry nuclear weapons.</p>
                    <p>I would propose to tell Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1"
                            >Rabin</persName> that:</p>

                        <item>
                            <p>Israel may consider such weapons to be a deterrent to hostile action
                                by Arab states. The United States Government, having had
                                considerably more experience with nuclear weapons and the concept of
                                deterrence than any other nation on earth, does not believe that
                                these weapons will have the effect on which Israel presumably is
                                counting. Instead, we believe it will compel the U.S.S.R. to station
                                nuclear missiles in the U.A.R. and perhaps in other Arab
                                countries.</p>
                            <p>Such a concept leaves out entirely possible actions by the Soviet
                                Union with respect to the Arab states or with respect to Israel. It
                                also ignores the unstable and irrational nature of the Arabs. Our
                                belief, based on experience, is that deterrence of this kind can
                                work only if the other side is not only capable of rational
                                analysis, but of sustained rational action, particularly in times of
                                great stress. We know, and Israel knows, that neither the Egyptians
                                nor the Syrians nor the Iraqis have been known to exhibit such
                                rational thought and behavior and we cannot be sure that they will
                                be for decades to come. Furthermore, the United States, by selling
                                Phantom aircraft to Israel, is entering into a new relationship not
                                only as the principal arms supplier to Israel—when only a short time
                                before we publicly refused to be a major arms supplier—but also, and
                                partly by virtue of that fact, will put ourselves in a more
                                vulnerable position with respect to any future hostilities. For <pb
                                    n="588" xml:id="pg_588" facs="0616"/>these reasons, we must ask
                                of Israel certain assurances prior to entering this new
                                relationship;</p>

                        <item>Specifically, we would include in any written agreement for the sale
                            of the aircraft, the following assurances: <list>

                    <p>I have set my meeting with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1"
                            >Rabin</persName> for Monday afternoon, November 4. He can be expected
                        to react strongly to my approach and immediately to notify both his
                        government and others in order to elicit the maximum pressure on us to
                        change our position. The meeting, however, should be a long one and the
                        repercussions should not be felt until Tuesday. If you approve this
                        approach, I will of course report immediately to you after my session with
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> for further
                        instructions.</p>
                    <p>One happenstance that may work out well is that I am leaving for Europe on
                        Wednesday, the 6th, and I therefore recommend that Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName>'s next session be with Paul
                            <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName>. If Paul <persName
                            corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> then takes the same line with the
                        Ambassador on the 6th of November that I have taken on the 4th, the Israeli
                        Government might become accustomed shortly thereafter to the thought that we
                        are serious in this matter.</p>
                    <p>In the meantime, I recommend that you report to the President how we intend
                        to negotiate with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName>,
                        and why.</p>
                    <p>I am also attaching a proposed exchange of letters between the President and
                        Prime Minister Eshkol with respect to the assurances that we require.<note
                            n="3" xml:id="d300fn3">Not printed.</note> I consider this method of
                        receiving the assurances the most binding and therefore the most suitable. A
                        cross-reference to these letters could be made in the actual contract. My
                        second preference for receiving written assurances would be in a
                        government-to-government Memorandum of Understanding. In this memorandum
                        there should be a clause which connects Israel's assurances with paragraph 6
                        of the Standard Sales Contract, which reads: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“6. Under unusual and compelling circumstances when the best interest
                                of the United States requires it, reserves the right to cancel all
                                or part of this offer at any time prior to the delivery of defense
                                articles <pb n="589" xml:id="pg_589" facs="0617"/>or performance of
                                services. It shall be responsible for all costs resulting from
                                cancellations under this paragraph.”</p>
                        </quote>
                    </p>
                    <p>I would also recommend as additional sweeteners to obtain the assurances we
                        desire, that we be prepared to offer a number of other items; for example: <list>
                            <label>(a)</label>
                            <item>As is already inserted in the draft proposed letter from the
                                President to the Prime Minister: “The United States undertakes to
                                provide Israel with sufficient conventional military equipment to
                                meet its legitimate security needs.”</item>
                            <label>(b)</label>
                            <item>We would also be prepared to offer something like the following: <list>
                                    <item>—Reconnaissance F-4s.</item>
                                    <item>—As many as 50 more F-4s if desired.</item>
                                    <item>—J-79 engines for which they have already asked for their
                                        Mirage IIIc.</item>
                                    <item>—Non-nuclear weapons systems for the F-4s of a kind which
                                        have previously been withheld, and a number of other items
                                        which they have requested which we have withheld for various
                                        reasons up to now.</item>
                                </list>
                            </item>
                        </list>
                    </p>
                    <p>Finally, I recommend that in the event you are unable to see the President on
                        this subject between now and 2:00 o'clock on Monday afternoon, November 4,
                        that I nevertheless be authorized to talk to Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> along the lines set forth above.</p>

                        <item>Riad said <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> hopes something can be
                            done; hopes US can do something. Observed that Secy and <gloss
                                target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> had not left Vietnam situation for new
                            administration, but had taken big step of halting bombing which it could
                            be hoped would together with other steps lead to peace. Secy said it
                            takes two to make peace in <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> as in
                                <gloss target="#t_ME1">ME</gloss>. Riad said it will be very
                            difficult in <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> and <gloss
                                target="#t_ME1">ME</gloss> since no one has magic wand to bring
                            peaceful situation in 24 hours. In <gloss target="#t_ME1">ME</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> hopes there will be peace, but does
                            not call alternative “war.” Alternative is rather “destruction” and
                            after more destruction settlement would eventually be found. As he and
                            Secy had agreed a year ago, time not in favor of peace but running
                            against peace. If anything this more true today and it necessary to work
                            hard to achieve peace. With opposing forces confronting each other there
                            bound to be incidents, exchanges of fire, resistance. Secy observed
                            these have tendency to build into chain reaction with momentum which
                            leads to larger incidents and full scale hostilities. Riad agreed,
                            referring to last incident in which Israeli “plane” bombed bridges, dam,
                            and power plant inside <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. Riad said
                            this destroys little <pb n="591" xml:id="pg_591" facs="0619"/>in itself,
                            but causes disaster for agricultural food production which must depend
                            on irrigation. Thus Israel initiating dangerous new stage of warfare and
                            if retaliation being considered in Cairo it would have to be something
                            equivalent in importance to what Israel doing to <gloss target="#t_UAR1"

                        <item>Riad said even after further rounds of destruction on both sides there
                            would have to be settlement, so why not do it now? But if peace must be
                            achieved, how can it be done? This subject of discussion in <gloss
                                target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> since June 5, 1967. <gloss

                            <gloss target="#t_Res1">Res</gloss> but whether <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                                >UAR</gloss> likes it or not it is a solution and <gloss
                                target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> has accepted it because of need to be
                            realistic. Israel and <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> might not like
                                <gloss target="#t_Res1">Res</gloss> but they have to accept it. Main
                            question is whether Israel gives up desire for expansion as <gloss
                                target="#t_Res1">Res</gloss> requires. Independence and security of
                            all countries—not just Israel-must be guaranteed. Other questions of
                            refugees and navigation part of <gloss target="#t_Res1">Res</gloss> and
                            must also be settled but main problem is territorial question and
                            security for both sides. Anyone who wants to be fair would agree. Up to
                            now <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> has felt implementation of
                                <gloss target="#t_Res1">Res</gloss> will lead to peace. If situation
                            drags on unresolved, however, Arabs will continue to try to strengthen
                            their position in face of occupation, there will be more incidents, and
                            prospects for peace will dwindle since who would talk peace with Israel
                            in wake of further Israeli aggression? This is why time very precious
                            and it necessary to work hard and very quickly so <gloss

                        <item>Secy said he speaking only for US, not anyone else. US had supported
                            and continues to support the territorial integrity and political
                            independence of states in <gloss target="#t_ME1">ME</gloss>. This not
                            one-sided policy; it had been applied to Lebanon, Jordan, Saudi Arabia,
                                <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, Kuwait, Libya, Tunisia, and
                            Morocco in past. Had <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> Pres not closed
                            Straits of Tiran in May 1967 not one inch of territory would have been
                            jeopardized; had he said on June 1 what he said in September 1967 about
                            Tiran none of problems he and Riad discussing today would be confronting
                            them. Secty said it not <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> policy to
                            support Israeli territorial expansion. Except for events of May-June
                            1967 there would not have been danger of territorial expansion. Secy
                            asked Riad to look at question from US point of view. US pressed Israel
                            to withdraw from Sinai in 1957 and with inter alia closing of Straits in
                            1967 US kicked in shin. Likewise, US would have supported original
                            Palestine <gloss target="#t_Res1">Res</gloss> of 1948, but it had been
                            resisted by arms and slipped out of window.</item>

                        <item>Riad accepted Secy's points; said he not talking about attitude of US
                            but attitude of Israel. <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> could do
                            nothing with historical factors and support of big powers for
                            establishment of Jewish state; problem is whether Israel is going to

                        <label>7.</label>
                        <item>Secy said for US to give expression of our attitude, we need help from
                            Arab side. At critical times this had not been forthcoming. He proposed
                            breaking settlement problem into its component parts. Jordan could take
                            care of its own interests. Re <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, he
                            did not see any reason why Israel would levy territorial claims. Riad
                            interjected that it very difficult for him to talk about <gloss
                                target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> as <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>.
                            It too late for Egypt to discuss settlement problem in isolation from
                            other Arab states directly involved. If problem concerned Egypt only,
                            Egypt would never have become involved in 1948. Egypt was attacked in
                            1956 because she was involved. Israel could not withdraw from Sinai and
                            stay in other Arab areas. Secy said he had not said that:
                                <persName>Hussein</persName> had responsibility for Jordan, <gloss
                                target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> for <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                            >UAR</gloss>, etc. He wished to look at pieces so as to get settlement.
                            Riad reiterated that major question territorial one and that it could
                            not be solved in pieces because it matter of principle. <gloss
                                target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> could not have Israel withdraw from
                            Sinai leaving territorial questions for Jordan and Syria to be solved
                            subsequently. Feelings of people and policy of government would not

                            could not help him so he could try to find settlement himself. Riad said
                            “We freed him, but we cannot free ourselves” because <gloss
                                target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> cannot betray others due to pride and

                            anything unless Israel also leaves Sinai. Sinai was desert and <gloss
                                target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> could wait, but West Bank contained a
                            million people, for its part, however,<gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                                >UAR</gloss> could not go ahead alone, since Jordan and Syria would

                                >UAR</gloss>-Israel issues sorted out in some fashion. Asked Riad

                            problem by pieces then bring them together, Riad said matter of
                            principle re acquisition of territory as result of war had to be agreed
                            on first and on this answer was either yes or no. Discussion of
                            navigation, Holy Places in Jerusalem, demilitarization and security for
                            both sides in Syrian heights sector etc could be discussed for Israel
                            and each party, but not territorial question which only one question and
                            is matter of principle. If territorial question between Israel and each
                            party taken separately <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_Res1">Res</gloss> loses meaning. So <gloss

                            previously answered matters of detail on navigation and how to sign doc
                            or paper to fulfill obligations at previous mtg with Secy. Riad
                            emphasized <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> answers on details all on
                            assumption that Israel accepts and implements <gloss target="#t_SC1"

                            <gloss target="#t_Res1">Res</gloss> and ready to withdraw. Up to present
                            moment, Riad had not heard that Israel ready to implement res; this was

                            words which Israel must use—“accept and implement”—and that what <gloss

                                >UAR</gloss> interprets it. Suggested that <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                                >UAR</gloss> would reject requirement that <gloss target="#t_UAR1"

                                >Res</gloss> as Israel interprets it. Secy said he could not see why
                            any government should accept words of another government subject to that
                            other government's interpretation. <gloss target="#t_Res1">Res</gloss>
                            should be accepted for implementation by each as each interprets it with

                            there is no difference between <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and
                            Israel because <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> has given its
                            interpretation but <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> has not heard
                            Israel's interpretation. All <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> had
                            heard was that Israel accepted <gloss target="#t_Res1">Res</gloss> as
                            agenda. Riad asked if Secy knows what Israel's interpretation of <gloss
                                target="#t_Res1">Res</gloss> is. Secy said <gloss target="#t_Res1"
                                >Res</gloss> not self-executing and details have to be negotiated.
                            Riad asked if this view of US or of Israel? He asking for Israel's view.
                            Secy said he not speaking for Israel, but that US could not go to either
                            side and say you must implement <gloss target="#t_Res1">Res</gloss> as
                            interpreted by other side. Riad asked but what does Israel say? <gloss
                                target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> had told <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                                >Jarring</persName>
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> aim is peace and peace can be
                            achieved by implementing solution in res. Riad said we should forget all
                            words and see how we can implement res. <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                                >UAR</gloss> accepted <gloss target="#t_Res1">Res</gloss> and for
                            first several months of <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>
                            Mission he had refused to give answers to specific questions pending
                            Israel's acceptance of res. Then he gave answers to <persName
                                corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>, but perhaps this was mistake
                            since Israel still not forthcoming on this matter of principle. Secy
                            said he had not seen Eban since latter's return to NY, but if Israel
                            agrees implement <gloss target="#t_Res1">Res</gloss> on basis of details
                            worked out through negotiations would Riad object to that? Riad said if
                            Israel says that he will have no objection. Secy said beyond withdrawal
                            from <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> territory, he not really clear
                            on <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> answers <pb n="594"
                                xml:id="pg_594" facs="0622"/>on other parts of res. Riad, for
                            example, had linked refugees to Canal, but <gloss target="#t_Res1"
                                >Res</gloss> does not so link them. Riad said he not officially
                            connecting anything, but accepted <gloss target="#t_Res1">Res</gloss> as
                            package at urging of US. Riad reiterated that it impossible to split
                            main question of territory into segments. Secy said it not possible to
                            insist on withdrawal until it known withdrawal to what. Withdrawal must
                            be to peace, but he unable as yet to see pieces of the pattern of peace.
                            US would not press anybody on withdrawal as first step leaving
                            everything else up in air to be discussed. US is trying to find way to
                            put pieces of puzzle together to get peace.</item>

                            does not know what policy of US is on res. US says there are different

                            has not heard specific interpretations of others including Israel and
                            US. Secy said interpretation of <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> not
                            known. Riad said <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> can answer on
                                <gloss target="#t_Res1">Res</gloss> point by point and had done so
                            several times. Secy said he would briefly give US interpretation of
                                <gloss target="#t_Res1">Res</gloss> as far as <gloss
                                target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> concerned. Riad said <gloss

                            Secy observed he talking to <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> of
                                <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. Riad said he and Secy
                            discussing res. France and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> had
                            told <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> clearly that Israel would have

                            to date from US. This big problem for <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                                >UAR</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> hoped one day
                            US would make its interpretation known. Secy said he could be specific
                            re what US thinks <gloss target="#t_Res1">Res</gloss> means for <gloss
                                target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>; he could not accept Riad as spokesman
                            of Arab world since others did not accept him as such any more than de
                            Gaulle accepted as spokesman for Europe by other Europeans. Riad said he
                            never said he spokesman for all Arabs. Secy said this implicit in Riad
                            statements. Riad said he could not be spokesman for all Arabs; he had
                            said repeatedly he could not speak for Palestinians and could only speak
                            about <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                                >UAR</gloss> ready to implement whole <gloss target="#t_Res1"

                            her welfare even sometimes at expense of our relations with <gloss
                                target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. Secy noted that he left Gaza question
                            dangling; he had referred to “<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                            territory.” He supposed there could be agreement about Gaza. Riad asked
                            agreement with whom-Israel? Secy suggested with Jordan. To Riad's query
                            on why Jordan, Secy said some say they want this and <gloss
                                target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> has no desire surely for Gaza “slum”;
                            perhaps could be handled as part of refugee problem. Riad said Secy knew
                            that Gaza was <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> responsibility; that
                                <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> had been there when Israel
                                attacked.<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> must see Gaza free of
                            Israeli occupation; after that it an Arab question. <gloss

                        <item>Riad said that from what Secy had said US policy concerning <gloss
                                target="#t_Res1">Res</gloss> is that there should be no territorial
                            gains. Riad said Israel must withdraw from all Arab territories, not
                            just Sinai. This would help achieve peace. On refugees, did US have in
                            mind <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> reses? Secy said he not talking
                            about plebiscite, but about giving each refugee fifteen countries to
                            chose from (including Israel) and then trying to accommodate their
                            wishes. <persName corresp="#p_RM2">Mohamed Riad</persName> noted <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> reses not against this: they required
                            repatriation/compensation but specified no methods or devices. Secy said
                            on basis he suggested he thought there could be a solution. Riad did not
                            demur; observed that many refugees had already gone elsewhere, including
                            to Cairo.</item>

                        <item>Riad said aspirin not enough for man with cancer and main question
                            still whether there enough support for peace in area. This main question
                            still to be answered by Israel. If clear answer given that there will be
                            no expansion, then all problems can be solved. If they reject expansion
                            and try to improve relations with Arabs there will be no problem.</item>

                        <item>Secy asked Riad if maximum effort could be made in next ten days. Riad
                            asked what Secy thinks can be done, what <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                                >UAR</gloss> should do? Riad said he in NY for six weeks and had not
                            seen any movement, only generalities. He had told <persName
                                corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> he would have to leave for Cairo
                            soon. If Eban returned with same nine points and no answers to Riad's
                            two questions—as press reports seemed to indicate—then he would leave at
                            once for Cairo. This would not mean end of discussion; he could return
                            to NY at any time. Movement would depend on whether Eban ready to move
                            on question of implementation of res. <gloss target="#t_UAR1"

                        <label>18.</label>
                        <item>Secy asked whether Riad could give reaction on purely bilateral basis
                            to his seven points. Riad said his reaction could be given now and that
                            main question is territorial. He welcomed Secy's attitude on Sinai,
                            which he still hoped could be extended to other territories. <gloss
                                target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> could not move to settlement unless
                            assured Israel would withdraw from all Arab territories. Secy suggested
                            that in commenting on his seven points, Riad might add additional point
                            that <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> could not itself agree on
                            settlement unless something worked out for other Arab states and that if
                            something worked out for others, <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                            could agree to settle. Secy suggested that El-Kony and Wiggins might get
                            together re seven points. Riad reiterated that territorial question
                            uppermost. Re <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> Secy asked if in view
                            of his first point other six points acceptable? (Said no need for answer
                            on this at present mtg.) Riad said everything is in res, that <gloss
                                target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> accepts <gloss target="#t_Res1"
                                >Res</gloss> and prepared to fulfill all its obligations under res.
                            He had told <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> looking for final settlement in
                            which all questions settled. He had responded to <persName
                                corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>'s questions by saying <gloss
                                target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> would accept <gloss target="#t_UNEF1"
                                >UNEF</gloss> in Sharm El-Sheik and Gaza and Sinai; free navigation
                            in Straits of Tiran not a problem, etc. On signing paper, this depends
                            on paper and how it looks and how other questions are solved. <gloss
                                target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> has no objection as matter of principle
                            to pledge or paper which it would sign and which would be sent to all
                            members of <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> so that it signed not only
                            “to Israel but to all the world.” <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                            ready to do this and if Israel comes and signs on “that” afterwards,
                            this would depend on paper itself, and if it “my doc.” Secy said this
                            would be then a contractual obligation between <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                                >UAR</gloss> and Israel. Riad said <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                                >UAR</gloss> signature would be on doc, but details would have to be
                            worked out. Riad said <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> had signed
                            four agreements with Israel; that this not the question; that <gloss
                                target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> ready to sign. But it must be a paper
                            on which all our obligations are written and stated.</item>
                        <label>19.</label>
                        <item>Re arms, Riad said <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> would be most
                            happy to be released from arms spending since high levels of arms
                            expenditure inhibit economic growth. If <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                                >UAR</gloss> sure Israel not bent on expansion, <gloss
                                target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> would need no arms since no threats to
                                <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> from elsewhere. Secy said two
                            psychological issues are involved: 1) Arabs fear Israeli expansion; 2)
                            Israelis fear Arab desire to destroy Israel. What could be done? Riad
                            said <pb n="597" xml:id="pg_597" facs="0625"/>anyone could see that to
                            destroy Israel not possible practically speaking, but that for Israel to
                            expand all that is needed is for her to annex territory on which she
                            sits by having defeated Arabs.</item>
                        <label>20.</label>
                        <item>Riad again asked if Secy could advise him on what could be done in
                            next few days, as he would have to be returning to Cairo. He might also
                            need to return home for consultation, and could have done so during
                            Eban's delay. Secy remarked that Eban had returned to Israel with strong
                            recommendations from US but that Cabinet Oct 27 had been fully
                            preoccupied with artillery battle across Canal which, together with
                            Eshkol's illness, brought delay. Riad said Eban now returning and
                            question is whether he brings anything hopeful. Secy said he did not
                            know; he would be seeing Eban following day. Secy said it reasonable for
                            Arabs press territorial question and reasonable for Israel to press
                            other questions. Riad recalled that Eban reportedly had once talked of
                            maximum security for Israel and minimum border corrections. What was
                            Israel's position on this? Secy reiterated that on <gloss
                                target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> border he did not think there would be
                            any change. Riad said he talking about res. Secy said Hussein could
                            speak for Jordan. Riad recalled that Secy had spoken of US support for
                            Arabs at times of need; <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> could do no
                            less.</item>

                        <item>In closing comment, Secy said he hoped Riad would understand that US

                                >GOI</gloss> Cabinet. Eban said Suez Canal bombardment weekend after
                            his arrival in Israel had created unfavorable atmosphere and first idea
                            had been not to reply at all to Riad paper since it only invective and
                            propaganda containing nothing specific and concrete to continue
                            dialogue. Eban said he pointed out clear relation of any prospect for
                            progress with Jordan to keeping process alive with <gloss
                                target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and Cabinet decision then taken to
                            pursue dialogue further. Eban said he wished touch on three points: 1)
                            process of clarification with Jordan on which there had been further
                            progress; 2) Cabinet study of what position would be taken if
                            negotiations forthcoming with <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>; and
                            3) tactical considerations relating to <persName corresp="#p_JG1"

                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>Eban said process of clarification with Jordan advancing and expected
                            to culminate mid-November. (Septel) In meantime, it absolutely essential
                            to keep <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> available. Secy
                            asked how Eban anticipated giving <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                                >Jarring</persName> Mission enough nourishment keep it alive during
                            this period. Eban said it is fact that there are possibilities and
                            impossibilities with Israel as with <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>:
                            it would be impossible for <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> to commit
                            “whole destiny” to text without safety catch of “agreement.” Eban said
                            Israel would be able to say something about having accepted <gloss
                                target="#t_Res1">Res</gloss> and willing discuss ways reach full
                            agreement on implementing its provisions as <gloss target="#t_Amb1"
                                >Amb</gloss> Barbour had proposed. Problem is that <gloss
                                target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> keeps wanting imposed settlement
                            whereas Israel wants agreed settlement. Eban said <persName
                                corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> had asked for anything to keep
                            Riad in picture, and this all right with Israel. Problem is that Jordan
                            does not want to go it alone so <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> must
                            be at least indirectly in picture: it must be triangular not bilateral
                            process. Eban said <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> position of
                            placing implementation of <gloss target="#t_Res1">Res</gloss> in context
                            of peace valid in terms both of international law and <gloss

                                >UAR</gloss> and Jordan should be persuaded that there would not be

                            left unanswered question in <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> paper as

                        <item>In response to Wiggins question as to what Eban would say to <persName
                                corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>, Eban said he would refer to his

                                >Jarring</persName> and ask <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                                >Jarring</persName> to move mission out of declaratory rut and into
                            specifics. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> said he would tell
                                <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> frankly that <gloss
                                target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> had decided to go on with mission and
                            with clarification process with Jordan, especially over next two weeks,
                            and that it most important that <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                                >Jarring</persName> not remove himself at this stage.</item>

                        <item>Re <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_EA1"
                                >Eban</persName> said he had enough to draft something for <persName
                                corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> today or tomorrow which he
                            thought would satisfy third parties that Riad would be justified in not
                            breaking up mission. Nothing suggests that <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                                >UAR</gloss> prepared for peace. Either whatever <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> telling them <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                                >UAR</gloss> not listening to, or <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss> not telling them to make peace. Intoxicated speeches
                            of two weeks ago and on throwing Israel into sea reminiscent of May-June
                            1967. Fact that 20 Israelis killed in last barrage and little damage
                            done to <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> must have had enormous
                            influence on hawks in Cairo who wish to gain time for either partial or
                            complete military victory against Israel. Despite <gloss
                                target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> pessimistic view of <gloss
                                target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> intentions, Israel would like to secure
                            limited tactical objective of making it difficult for Cairo to break off
                            on <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> Mission without loss in
                            world opinion. Israel would address itself in this phase with <persName
                                corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> to get enough acquiescence on
                                <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> part to let process of
                            clarification with Jordan proceed. Secy observed that return by Riad to
                            Cairo would not necessarily mean breaking off <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                                >Jarring</persName> Mission. <persName corresp="#p_EA1"
                                >Eban</persName> said gist of <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
                            approach would be to: 1) reaffirm willingness to exchange views on
                            certain matters of substance through <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                                >Jarring</persName>; 2) press for precise definition by parties of
                            positions including answers to questions Israel had already put so that
                            positions could be compared and scope of difficulties of settlement
                            estimated; and 3) make declaration with text almost identical to that
                            suggested by US but (a) without accepting view that <gloss
                                target="#t_Res1">Res</gloss> invalidated because it contains
                            “agreement,” and (b) giving “functional” rather than geographical
                            formula on boundary question which should make clear that Israel's
                            purpose is not expansionism and that once boundaries and security
                            arrangements agreed troops would be disposed accordingly. More specific
                            position would be made known when Israel-<gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                                >UAR</gloss> effort moved from tactical to substantive stage
                            (septel), but it would be counterproductive to discuss specifics while
                                <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> not talking peace. <persName
                                corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> had never said Israel should
                            give map or lines. If <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> says something
                            on paper which is concrete and conciliatory Israel could say something
                            more specific on boundary and res. <persName corresp="#p_EA1"
                                >Eban</persName> said Israel prepared to discuss further all three
                            aspects of approach he had outlined.</item>
                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>Re tactics, <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> said Israel
                            giving first priority to <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>
                            Mission; whoever breaks off mission, whether <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                                >UAR</gloss> or <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>
                            himself, would assume heavy international responsibility. <persName
                                corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> said he would be seeing <persName
                                corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> sometime tonight or tomorrow.
                            Secondly, <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> thinks <pb n="600"
                                xml:id="pg_600" facs="0628"/>
                            <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> should consider again
                            proposal he made in March 1968 about meetings of parties under his
                            auspices. This at least useful as operative proposal on table and Israel
                            would say in advance that <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> would
                            accept proposal if made now. Thirdly, Israel would follow up on
                                <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> speech to <gloss
                                target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> and on Israel's seven questions to <gloss
                                target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> to see if perhaps agreement could be
                            reached on one or more points in contingent initial discussion. With
                            these procedural proposals, together with willingness work out
                            declarations both vis-a-vis <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and
                            Jordan (septel), Israel prepared stand before public opinion if Riad
                            leaves and <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> Mission
                            collapses. In answer to Secy question, Eban said he would have to return
                            to Israel sometime after Nov 15, but could in interim continue

                            agreed that Riad might well want to return to Cairo. But that where he
                            might be located for a short period of time not as important as whether

                                corresp="#p_WJR1">Wiggins</persName> asked how far <persName

                            territory aims and advised him to be as specific and substantive on this
                            as possible. <persName corresp="#p_WJR1">Wiggins</persName> said he felt
                            Rifai wants peace and that Riad has seemed better on this score now than
                            he was previously. Re <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>,
                                <persName corresp="#p_WJR1">Wiggins</persName> said he had moved off
                            demand for total and complete specificity of a week ago and reverted to
                            earlier position that what required <pb n="601" xml:id="pg_601"
                                facs="0629"/>is something with which he can work. <persName

                            not its purpose and that troops would be disposed according to secure

                            <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> said substantive position
                            Israel would take if <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> willing to talk
                            peace. He wanted US and US alone to know re Sinai, it all comes back
                            strongly and sharply to Sharm el-Sheikh, the focal point of two wars.
                            Israel could not accept something which might mean Israel would once
                            again have to send men out to open Straits. Israel would want
                            arrangement enabling Israel to be in Sharm el-Sheikh in order to protect
                            Israeli shipping, with direct communication between Eilat and Sharm
                            el-Sheikh. <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> added: “Direct
                            land communication.” <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> said he
                            had not discussed this in juridical terms; control of territory without
                            sovereignty had been factor in Japan-<gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss> and Japan-US agreements and in Cyprus settlement.
                                <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> said especially if <gloss
                                target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> asked for enclave positions for one
                            reason for another, Israel would want to be there and in direct land
                            communication with Eilat.</item>

                            <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> said what <gloss
                                target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> might propose would be another matter,
                            but Israel would not want to prejudice matters before negotiations
                            begin. <pb n="602" xml:id="pg_602" facs="0630"/>Therefore, Israel will
                            give functional not territorial definition. Israel does not think <gloss
                                target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> has right to stop Israel from asking
                            for this; they can say no and then talk. This all <persName
                                corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> could say on Sinai. It was
                            functional statement relating to security and navigation (in Tiran), but
                            functional requirements could have territorial implications. <persName
                                corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> said <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                                >UAR</gloss> doesn't raise question of Gaza, but he thinks they
                            understand they not coming back to Gaza.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>Secretary said he thought what <persName corresp="#p_EA1"
                                >Eban</persName> outlined on Sinai non-starter. Alternative was in
                            direction of improved international arrangements which were workable.
                                <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> said <gloss
                                target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> hadn't suggested that or anything else.
                            Israel's experience with <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and any
                            arrangement with veto unsatisfactory. Secretary said it important that
                            there not be veto. He could understand Israeli dissatisfaction with
                            arrangements to date, but Israeli presence would be point of infection
                            such that there would be tension thereafter and hard to see how there
                            could be peace. <persName corresp="#p_WJR1">Wiggins</persName> said
                            international presence would have to be such as to be terminated only by
                            action of Security Council. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName>
                            said he didn't see if local sovereignty said international presence
                            should terminate what country, including US, would stand against it.
                            Secy referred to arrangements in Panama Canal and Okinawa where local
                            sovereignty modified. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> said Israel ready to
                            have such treaties.</item>

                            <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> said no point in going into
                            this in detail now since not in negotiating situation. It necessary to
                            hear what <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> would propose. Secy
                            reiterated that as far as US attitude concerned, he had to put in
                            reservation about Sharm el-Sheikh idea: US does not feel it could
                            support that under present circumstances.</item>

                                crowd of demonstrators attacked the U.S. Embassy in Amman on the
                                anniversary of the signing of the Balfour Declaration. A number of
                                windows in the Embassy were broken, one vehicle was damaged, and the
                                U.S. flag was torn down. Police and security units dispersed the
                                crowd. (Telegram 7315 from Amman, November 2; ibid.) On November 3
                                the Jordanian Army arrested 70 members of the Tahir Dadlan Fedayeen
                                group and held them responsible for instigating the attack on the
                                Embassy. (Telegram 7321 from Amman, November 4; ibid.) Heavy
                                fighting between Fedayeen units and the Jordanian Army broke out
                                following the arrests. (Telegram 7322 from Amman, November 4; ibid.)
                                The Embassy reported that, in addition to the arrests, the
                                government informed al-Fatah leaders that no uniformed Fedayeen
                                would be permitted in Jordanian towns, that all Fedayeen
                                organizations would be interdicted from firing across cease-fire
                                lines, and that any infiltration operations into Israel or occupied
                                territory would have to be coordinated with the Jordanian Army.
                                (Telegram 7328 from Amman, November 4; ibid.) On the afternoon of

                                (Telegram 7333 from Amman, November 4; ibid.)</note> (b) requested
                            that US promptly inform Israelis that Fedayeen organizations may try

                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> opened the
                        conversation by referring to his meeting on 30 October with Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_HPT1">Hart</persName>, in which <persName
                            corresp="#p_HPT1">Hart</persName> had asked <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1"
                            >Rabin</persName> to write a proposed Memorandum of Understanding
                        incorporating the provisions Israel considered necessary to the F-4 sale.
                        This was written and delivered to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HPT1"
                            >Hart</persName>.<note n="2" xml:id="d306fn2">See <ref target="#d298fn2"
                                >footnote 2, Document 298</ref>.</note> “We put in it what we
                        thought was necessary, following the precedent of the prior agreement <pb
                            n="605" xml:id="pg_605" facs="0633"/>(A-4 aircraft).” Last Friday, 1
                        November, <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> said he received a
                        call from Department of State to the effect that “in principle, the answer
                        is yes” with regard to Israel's request for F-4s and that he was to get in
                        touch with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WPC1">Warnke</persName>. Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> said that today he would
                        like to get agreement on how we proceed but not go into details.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WPC1">Warnke</persName> said that he would like at
                        the outset to set forth the United States' position. The President agrees in
                        principle to the sale. It is a difficult decision, not because we are not
                        interested in Israel's security, but precisely because we are interested.
                        Heretofore, we have avoided becoming the principal arms supplier to Israel.
                        Wherever possible we have urged that Israel acquire its arms from other
                        Western countries. We felt that this was to our mutual benefit for it
                        lessened the risk of US-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> confrontation
                        in the Middle East and therefore lessened the dangers to the security of the
                        United States and Israel. We would prefer to continue that policy; however,
                        the Europeans apparently have opted out, and the French particularly seem
                        reluctant to supply the Mirage aircraft Israel has purchased.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WPC1">Warnke</persName> stressed that with a
                        decision to go ahead on the sale of F-4 aircraft we will have a different
                        set of circumstances concerning our supply relationship to Israel. We will
                        henceforth become the principal arms supplier to Israel, involving us even
                        more intimately with Israel's security situation and involving more directly
                        the security of the United States.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WPC1">Warnke</persName> reminded Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> that Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> had talked with Foreign Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> about the problems and the
                        dangers of strategic missiles and nuclear weapons. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_WPC1">Warnke</persName> referred specifically to the
                        paragraph in the standard sales contract which permitted cancellation “under
                        unusual and compelling circumstances”; he suggested that Israeli acquisition
                        of strategic missiles and nuclear weapons would comprise such circumstances.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WPC1">Warnke</persName> told Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> that because the security of the
                        United States was clearly involved we must seek from the Government of
                        Israel certain assurances: <list>
                            <label>(1)</label>
                            <item>that Israel will not test or deploy strategic missiles,</item>
                            <label>(2)</label>
                            <item>that Israel will not develop, manufacture, or otherwise acquire
                                strategic missiles or nuclear weapons,</item>
                            <label>(3)</label>
                            <item>that Israel will sign and ratify the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
                                Treaty.</item>
                        </list>
                    </p>
                    <p>At a subsequent point in the conversation, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WPC1"
                            >Warnke</persName> mentioned the inspection arrangement at Dimona as a
                        precedent that might be required here.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WPC1">Warnke</persName> noted that we had not
                        sought such specific assurances in our prior agreements because, based on
                        the information we had at <pb n="606" xml:id="pg_606" facs="0634"/>that
                        time, these developments were not imminent. Our present information,
                        however, indicates that Israel is on the verge of nuclear weapons and
                        missiles capability. This development would seriously and adversely affect
                        the security interests of the United States; it involves the Soviet Union
                        and risks a US-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> confrontation; it
                        dramatically changes the situation in the area.</p>
                    <p>(Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> did not dispute in
                        any way our information on Israel's nuclear or missile capability, nor did
                        he comment directly on the assurances we requested. He did not seem
                        particularly surprised or upset at Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WPC1"
                            >Warnke</persName>'s presentation. He referred to the fact that the
                        Israeli position on the question of Israeli nuclear and missile programs had
                        been conveyed to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BW1"
                        >Barbour</persName>.)</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> observed that this
                        question (of missiles and nuclear weapons) had been raised two weeks ago,
                        and that an answer was given by the Israeli Government to the United States
                        Embassy in Israel. “I don't have anything to add to my Government's
                        position.” <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> said he was asked
                        to draft a Memorandum of Understanding which he had done and which we have.
                            <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> said that “if you wish to
                        suggest changes or additions to that memorandum you of course may do so.”
                            <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> remarked that, when he saw
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> on Sunday, the
                        Secretary said that the American acceptance in principle “did not mean that
                        we accept your draft Memorandum of Understanding.”</p>
                    <p>Commenting more generally, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1"
                            >Rabin</persName> said that Israel did not come to the United States for
                        military equipment when it could go elsewhere; with other governments Israel
                        did not have the problem of “conditions” that it has with the United States.
                        In any case, we do not see, said <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1"
                            >Rabin</persName>, that your selling us 50 Phantoms changes things
                        appreciably.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WPC1">Warnke</persName> said that it is not just 50
                        Phantoms, but 50 Phantoms plus 100 Skyhawks plus the great variety of other
                        equipment that Israel is requesting that makes the policy we are entering
                        upon a distinct change from our prior policy. Nevertheless, the United
                        States is interested in doing what is necessary to assist Israel. Opinions
                        vary on how best to do this but our goal is the same. It is for this reason
                        that we are so concerned with Israel's missile and nuclear plans and
                        intentions and this is why we need to “up-date” your assurances to us on
                        these matters.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WPC1">Warnke</persName> told Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> that we would prepare by tomorrow
                        for his review a revised Memorandum of Understanding incorporating the kinds
                        of assurances we require. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WPC1">Warnke</persName>
                        asked if there were other questions that Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> would like to speak about today.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> said that he would
                        like to call to our attention the current Israeli intelligence appreciation
                        of the build-up of Soviet <pb n="607" xml:id="pg_607" facs="0635"/>aircraft
                        in Egypt and Syria. He said that the figures General <persName
                            corresp="#p_WBGE1">Weizman</persName> had presented us in September 1967
                        had proven to be entirely too low. The inventories that <persName
                            corresp="#p_WBGE1">Weizman</persName> had projected for those two
                        countries by 1970 had in fact already been exceeded on 1 November 1968. The
                        Ambassador undertook to provide details separately.<note n="3"

                        <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> went on to say that a number
                        of technical terms needed going into, for example, Israel would like a
                        certain number—the more the better—of F-4s delivered in the first half of
                        1969 (he later put the number at 25 aircraft). He attributed the urgency to
                        “what was happening on the other side.” <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1"
                            >Rabin</persName> said that they would like credit arrangements if
                        possible, preferably on the same terms as the first Skyhawk sale (10 per
                        cent down, 3-1/2 per cent interest, 10 years repayment). <persName
                            corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> said they would like the F-4E
                        configuration generally, but wish to include in the 50 aircraft 6 RF-4Es.
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> and General
                            <persName corresp="#p_HBGM1">Hod</persName> asked if they could begin

                            >Jarring</persName> said he expects written Israeli reply today and in

                        enough, said Arabs would continue to insist on Israeli statement of
                        willingness to withdraw from “all” Arab territories; said Riad intended to
                        reply very promptly; thought Riad and Rifai both then likely to return home
                        for consultations, would not break talks off but was doubtful if they would
                        come back; feared protracted period of diplomatic stalemate (several months)
                        would result during which military engagements likely to increase in <pb

                        rigidities in situation he had experienced with all parties yesterday. While
                        expressing above views he also indicated he did not believe situation had
                        come to an end, and gave no indication he intended to throw in towel
                        himself. <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> listened carefully
                        but made no commitments to our suggestions (a) that key effort now was to
                        assure <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> reply contained some substantive

                            Nevertheless, <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> knew Israeli
                            reply would not be satisfactory to Arabs. <persName corresp="#p_EA1"
                                >Eban</persName> had not talked of “functional” approach to

                            would express its interests in Sinai as being security and “guarantees”
                            of freedom of navigation in Straits. He had left it to <persName
                                corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> to “guess” what guarantee they
                            might require, which he did not intend to do. From conversation with

                            “withdrawal” <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> said yes, but
                            when he had told <persName corresp="#p_TY1">Tekoah</persName> at

                            said he would make another effort on this directly with <persName

                            (in context Riad insistence on returning) with hope this would produce

                                Israel still refused to implement Resolution 242 and was actively
                                attempting to integrate captured Arab territory into Israel. Until
                                Israel was prepared to withdraw from all captured Arab territory,

                            While <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> written document would
                            not meet Arab views it was likely to go some distance beyond last
                            document, and the two together would contain considerable amount of
                            substantive statements of Israeli views. To keep issue moving it was now
                            critical to influence <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> reply to
                            include not just a new demand for Israeli views on withdrawal but as
                            much substance as possible. Otherwise it would be most difficult to make
                            any further progress in Israel. Suggested Rifai, who had been helpful to

                            was general intention behind his effort to get Riad not to reply right

                            <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> raised question of next
                            steps if current round of written exchanges came to end through
                            deficiencies of Israeli reply and another unsatisfactory <gloss

                                <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> thought about
                            possibility posing questions himself to both <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                                >UAR</gloss> and Israel, possibly also with suggested answers. Key
                            issue to Israel was nature of permanent peace; this might be put to
                                <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. Key issue to <gloss
                                target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> was boundary and withdrawal; this might

                            had of course thought about this possibility a lot. In fact he had put

                            early meeting in order to share his concern. Stressed he did not believe
                            Riad would “break off” talks with him, but repeated his concern rather
                            was that situation could go into protracted diplomatic stalemate for
                            several months, which would be hard to break, and that consequences in
                            area would be increased violence and military clashes. He felt, for

                            success in recent retaliation more likely to be to hit back itself than

                        assurances we seek, not the form.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> restated that he
                        could not give his Government's position, but that his reaction was: “I
                        don't believe Israel is going to accept conditions within a Memorandum of
                        Understanding about selling the Phantoms. We were told more than once that
                        there would be no conditions—at least not these kinds of conditions.” The
                        Ambassador then added, haltingly: “It would be a pity—all these conditions
                        on paper—just for 50 Phantoms.”</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WPC1">Warnke</persName> said that he did not
                        consider what was being discussed was “just 50 Phantom aircraft.” He said
                        that if we sold these 50 Phantom aircraft to Israel, our position would have
                        changed markedly to one of the principal supplier of arms to Israel and he
                        thought that the significance of this change is something that should be
                        thought about very carefully by the Israeli Government as well as by our
                        own. It is of great importance to Israel on the one hand and it is of
                        significance to the United States on the other because it means that the
                        security of the United States is more closely involved in the area. It is
                        this larger matter which should be considered concurrently with the
                        assurances for which we have asked.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> said that it would
                        be possible to have discussions on each of the items. But he again said, as
                        his personal reaction, that “to have these conditions just for selling of 50
                        Phantoms, I don't think it is right.”</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WPC1">Warnke</persName> repeated that the
                        Department of Defense would consider any other form which would give us
                        similar assurances that Israel would care to propose. Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> asked for time to study the
                        memorandum more carefully. He asked also whether, in the meantime, it would
                        be possible for Major General <persName corresp="#p_HBGM1">Hod</persName> to
                        talk with the U.S. Air Force.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WPC1">Warnke</persName> said that he had spoken
                        with Mr. <persName>Hoopes</persName>, Under Secretary of the Air Force, who
                        agreed to arrange for a F-4E briefing for General <persName
                            corresp="#p_HBGM1">Hod</persName> and would expect a call from <persName
                            corresp="#p_HBGM1">Hod</persName> tomorrow.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WPC1">Warnke</persName> said that we had drafted
                        the Memorandum of Agreement so that Israel could see clearly the things that
                        trouble us. Whether the assurances we receive are contained in separate
                        documents or whether we come to separate understandings is, to our way of
                        thinking, irrelevant. We feel we must know what missile and nuclear
                        developments <pb n="613" xml:id="pg_613" facs="0641"/>are going on in the
                        Middle East. These vitally affect the national security interests of the
                        United States. There has been a long and strong relationship between our two
                        countries. We must have mutual trust and confidence. [<hi rend="italic"

                        follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“I wish to address myself first to Article 3 of your proposed
                                Memorandum of Agreement. I am now in a position to confirm that my
                                original personal reaction upon first reading this paragraph—namely,
                                that it is completely unacceptable to us—is indeed my Government's
                                official position. We have come here for the purpose of purchasing
                                50 Phantoms. We have not come here in order to mortgage the
                                sovereignty of the State of Israel, not even for 50 Phantoms.
                                Furthermore, I wish to state that we consider Article 3 to be in the
                                nature of a very major condition precedent to the sale of aircraft
                                and it is therefore not acceptable to us also as a matter of
                                principle. My Government's position is that the matters raised in
                                Article 3 are extraneous to the question before us, namely, the
                                terms for the sale of 50 F-4 aircraft. These matters have been the
                                subject of separate discussions between our two Governments. Most
                                recently, 28 October 1968, we submitted through the U.S. Ambassador
                                to Israel a comprehensive statement concerning these issues, the
                                contents of which I can make available to you now.</p>
                            <p>“Accordingly, I should like to propose that Israel's assurances in
                                connection with the theoretical question of the use of the planes
                                for the delivery of nuclear weapons remains as submitted to you in
                                our original proposal, namely, that the Government of Israel agrees
                                not to use any aircrafts supplied by the U.S. as a nuclear weapons
                                carrier. I am also authorized to reaffirm, in this connection, that
                                it is Israel's long-standing policy not to be the first to introduce
                                nuclear weapons into the Middle East. Assurances to that effect can
                                be incorporated into the agreement.</p>
                            <p>“May I also comment on the Preamble to Article 3 and state that the
                                Government of Israel does not consider itself qualified to express
                                an opinion on what constitutes an endangerment of the security
                                interests of the U.S. This is the exclusive prerogative of the
                                Government of the U.S. Similarly, with reference to subsection 2 of
                                Article 2, the Government of Israel does not feel that it is
                                qualified to comment on what is or is not a major tenet of U.S.
                                policy. Again, this is the exclusive prerogative of the U.S.
                                Government.</p>
                            <p>“This is my Government's position and the only basis on which we
                                consider it possible to conduct negotiations for the purchase of
                                military equipment—in this case, 50 Phantoms.”</p>

                        reading from his prepared text, observed that paragraph 1 of the American
                        draft Memorandum of Agreement is an exact wording of the 1965 Memorandum of

                        reiterated that Israel did not believe that they were qualified to comment
                        or to make judgments concerning the points covered in Article 2. Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> also thought that Article
                        5 on secrecy was not even as favorable as the paragraph on secrecy in the

                        glanced at it, confirmed that we already had a copy, and returned it to

                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> said that General
                            <persName corresp="#p_HBGM1">Hod</persName> had met with the Air Force.
                        General <persName corresp="#p_HBGM1">Hod</persName> said that, while he had
                        one briefing, nothing more was being done, the Air Force was waiting for Mr.
                            <persName>Hoopes</persName>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SHH2"
                            >Schwartz</persName> explained that Mr. <persName>Hoopes</persName> had
                        forwarded the Israeli requests to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WPC1"
                            >Warnke</persName>, but, because Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WPC1"
                            >Warnke</persName> had just returned from Europe, he had not yet seen
                        Mr. <persName>Hoopes</persName>' memorandum.<note n="5" xml:id="d309fn5">Not
                            found.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> said: “So there we
                        are.” Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WPC1">Warnke</persName> said: “Yes, Mr.
                        Ambassador. We have managed to isolate a major difference.”</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WPC1">Warnke</persName> said he would like to take
                        issue with two points raised by the Ambassador: first, that our request for
                        assurances in connection with the sale of the F-4 aircraft is extraneous.
                        What Israel does with strategic missiles and nuclear weapons affects the
                        national security of the United States. “It is the national security of the
                        United States that I am charged with protecting. By law I am required to
                        consider the impact of the sale on the United States. You, from your vantage
                        point, do not have to accept my judgments, but I am required to make them.”
                        Second, the assurances we have requested are not, and are not intended to
                        be, an invasion of sovereignty. All international agreements impinge on
                        absolute sovereignty. Our request is no different than other international
                        agreements.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WPC1">Warnke</persName> said that however these
                        negotiations come out he has felt that this dialogue has been useful. “I
                        have felt it was important to get across to you how we feel about Israel's
                        acquisition of strategic missiles and nuclear weapons. As you know, there is
                        a provision in our sales contract that permits cancellation of the contract
                        by the United <pb n="616" xml:id="pg_616" facs="0644"/>States for ‘unusual
                        and compelling circumstances.’ To me, if Israel goes ahead with its missile
                        and nuclear programs this would involve that paragraph; and while I can not
                        speak for the next administration, I feel sure they will feel the same way
                        too. Therefore, to a considerable extent, the arguments we are having about
                        the wording of assurances are mere words and not substance. The substance
                        remains the same.”</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> said: “I can
                        understand you would like to have assurances about the way your hardware is
                        going to be used—not as a nuclear weapons carrier.” But in Article 3 you ask
                        for all the rights to know and for us to give agreement for you to inspect
                        in our country. We were very careful not to use the word “inspect” with
                        respect to Dimona. We see in the two words quite a difference. The word
                        “visit” means you are a guest in our country—not an inspector.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WPC1">Warnke</persName> said: “I would be prepared
                        to accept an amendment to our memorandum substituting ‘visit’ for
                        inspection.”</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> said: “We have an
                        agreement today.”</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WPC1">Warnke</persName> said: “Yes, but that
                        applies only to Dimona, not to the sites where missiles are being produced”
                        (nervous laughter from Israelis).</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> asked: “What do you
                        call strategic missiles in the Arab-Israeli context?” Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_WPC1">Warnke</persName> replied: “Those capable of reaching
                        the Arab capitals.” <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> agreed,
                        saying: “At least we have the same definition.” He also commented that the
                        missiles “would not reach all the Arab capitals.”</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WPC1">Warnke</persName> observed that the F-4
                        aircraft would be part of Israel's total defense environment; that they
                        would be used, as the General well knew, to protect strategic missile sites
                        as well as other possible targets. It is the totality of Israel's defense
                        that we are involved in; it is not just a question of aircraft.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> said: “You are only
                        selling arms. How do you feel you have the right to ask all these
                        things?”</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WPC1">Warnke</persName> said: “I think I do.
                        Otherwise I wouldn't bring it up.”</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> said: “We have
                        promised not to carry nuclear weapons and that we would not be the first to
                        introduce nuclear weapons into the Middle East.”</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WPC1">Warnke</persName> replied: “We will think
                        about what you have said and talk with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CCM1"
                            >Clifford</persName> and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_NPH1"

                            the Middle East, Semenov put a positive reading on the latest Israeli

                            with <persName corresp="#p_BWB1">Buffum</persName> that the next step

                        on the grounds [<hi rend="italic">1-1/2 lines of source text not

                        extremely dangerous for the national security of the United States. The
                        President apparently said that he had promised the F-4s without any
                        conditions, and that was his position. He did not even wish to accept Mr.

                                you state that, while there has not been as much progress as we had
                                hoped for, we think indirect exchanges between parties and various
                                bilateral conversations have been very useful. Most important thing
                                at this stage is to maintain and accelerate what momentum has
                                developed and keep <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>
                                exercise going. In this connection we pleased that, although Rifai

                                continue cooperate with <persName corresp="#p_JG1"

                                jeopardize continuation his mission. We plan continue maintain
                                closest contact with <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>
                                and parties. You may also repeat assurances given King in New York
                                Nov. 1967 concerning territorial aspects of settlement, including
                                point that U.S. prepared support return of West Bank to Jordan with
                                minor boundary rectifications. In discussing foregoing, you
                                requested ascertain from King his views re ways in which Jordan
                                might justify Israel's security requirements on West Bank. What
                                formula would <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> be prepared to
                                accept? For example, would <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss>
                                accept proposition of joint <gloss target="#t_GOJ1"
                                    >GOJ</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> patrols perhaps
                                made up of security police rather than military? Assure King that
                                you are only making informal probes on this subject and that you are
                                only seeking his preliminary views.<note n="3" xml:id="d312fn3"

                                a case against convening Arab Summit since this, after all, is
                                King's business, not ours. He may have his own strong views and, if
                                so, we would not wish make an issue out of this. We recall
                                    <persName>Hussein</persName>'s desire over past several months
                                to convene another Arab Summit conference for purpose of renewing
                                mandate for Arabs to seek political solution to Middle East crisis.
                                We also recollect that <persName>Hussein</persName> hoped to use
                                such a conference to achieve Arab intergovernmental coordination on
                                bringing fedayeen under control. We seriously doubt that an Arab
                                Summit would achieve these laudable goals. We fear that another
                                summit at this time is more likely to harden Arab public positions
                                on an approach to a settlement with Israel, thereby further reducing

                        East and to pledge not to use the F-4s to carry nuclear weapons.</p>
                    <p>Rostow told <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Feinberg</persName> that the Israelis

                        agreed that Israel should not go further down the nuclear road. He urged

                        wanted to resume relations. Muhammad smiled and said he did not know.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA1">Ashraf</persName> said the ball was now in
                        our court. Muhammad said he hoped that if there was progress towards
                        resumption it would not be derailed again. He then confided that the <gloss
                            target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> had been moving towards resumption last
                        February but had changed its mind because of remarks and actions of
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>, who had given
                        complete credence to the Israelis but had refused to believe anything the
                        Egyptians said. He referred specifically to Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>'s acceptance of the Israeli
                        contention that the Egyptians were insisting on withdrawal first in spite of
                        Egyptian assurances to us to the contrary.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PRB1">Parker</persName> said there had been a good
                        deal of confusion as to the Egyptian position because of the elliptical
                        statements issuing from the Egyptians themselves. He himself had gotten into
                        trouble with the Egyptians for pointing out that <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                            >Jarring</persName> apparently thought they were insisting on withdrawal
                        first. He had only been trying to do a service by pointing out that there
                        was a communications failure. All he had succeeded in doing was making
                        people mad, but he had been vindicated when <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                            >Jarring</persName> subsequently told <persName corresp="#p_RM1">Mahmoud

                        was still insisting on withdrawal first. Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> could certainly not be blamed if
                        he reported what the Israelis told him. He also reported what the Egyptians
                        and Jordanians told him.</p>

                        explanation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PRB1">Parker</persName> said the
                        Welles story was not accurate. The Department's spokesman on November 7 had
                        said negotiations on the Phantoms were still continuing. This was correct.
                        He would not try to mislead them; Israel would get the Phantoms sooner or
                        later. But the terms of the deal were still under discussion and no
                        agreement had been reached, nor had any decision been taken as alleged by
                        Welles. <persName corresp="#p_GA1">Ashraf</persName> asked where Welles had
                        gotten the story then. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PRB1">Parker</persName>
                        said he believed it had come from someone in the aircraft industry.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_GA1">Ashraf</persName> asked whether the last sentence

                        expedited if conditions in the area warranted, was not really the most
                        important thought in it and the real reason for its appearance at that
                        particular juncture. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PRB1">Parker</persName>
                        explained that newspaper stories were usually written in discrete groups of
                        paragraphs so that they could be cut down to fit available space without
                        destroying the completeness of thought. The least important paragraphs were
                        usually at the end of the story.</p>

                            <persName>Rostow</persName> described the situation in the Middle East
                        as “very delicate,” and <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> noted
                        that Israeli Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName> was
                        “fighting for his political life.” <persName corresp="#p_RD1"
                            >Rusk</persName> added that the crux of the problem was that the Arab
                            <pb n="624" xml:id="pg_624" facs="0652"/>states thought that Israel was
                        interested in territorial expansion and Israel thought that the Arabs were
                        interested in exterminating Israel. <persName corresp="#p_RD1"
                            >Rusk</persName> also told Nixon that he would have to face the problem
                        of how to keep nuclear weapons out of the Middle East. If the Israelis
                        developed nuclear weapons, <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> felt
                        the Soviet Union would respond by putting nuclear weapons into Egypt.
                        President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> said that he had
                        hoped to get the Non-Proliferation Treaty, which Israel had not yet agreed
                        to sign, approved before he authorized the sale of Phantom jet aircraft to
                        Israel. (Meeting Notes, November 11; Johnson Library, National Security

                    <p>The issue of Israel's adherence to the Non-Proliferation Treaty came up again
                        in a November 24 telephone conversation between <persName corresp="#p_RWW1"
                            >Walt Rostow</persName> and Robert D. Murphy, who was advising

                        told Murphy that he had a message for Nixon from President <persName

                        administration was negotiating the sale of the Phantom jets with Israel and
                        was trying to factor into the sale as much “nuclear restraint” on Israel's
                        part as Israel would agree to. The United States was pushing Israel to sign
                        the Non-Proliferation Treaty. To that end, President <persName
                            corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> was considering calling a special
                        session of Congress at the beginning of December devoted to the issue of the
                        treaty, which would have the effect of putting additional pressure on
                        allies, such as Israel, which had not yet signed the treaty.
                            <persName>Johnson</persName> felt that Nixon's endorsement of calling
                        such a special session was important, and implied that he would only go
                        forward with Nixon's endorsement. (Memorandum of telephone conversation,
                        November 24; ibid., Murphy, Robert D) Murphy replied on Nixon's behalf in a
                        telephone conversation with <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> on
                        November 29. Murphy said that Nixon felt that until he succeeded to the
                        presidency the management of the effort to win approval of the
                        Non-Proliferation Treaty was President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1"
                            >Johnson</persName>'s responsibility. Noting that Nixon had problems
                        with members of his own party on the issue, Murphy said that Nixon would not
                        take an active part in the debate over the treaty, nor would he express hope
                        of ratification in a special session. (White House telegram CAP 82813 from

                        with you again a subject that has become of increasing importance to me as I
                        enter the closing days of my Administration.</p>
                    <p>As I look back over my five years in office, I find that one endeavor
                        overshadows all those that have called upon my time and energy. This has
                        been the search for peace. Central to it has been our effort to prevent the
                        spread of nuclear weapons. The United States has assumed a special
                        responsibility for this endeavor. It is at the heart not only of my own
                        nation's security interests but also of the security of every nation in the
                        world. As you know I am personally deeply committed to this task.</p>
                    <p>My deep concern on this subject was expressed to you personally as long ago
                        as June 1964. Since then there has been no slackening of the arms race in
                        the Near East, and the weapons introduced into the area have grown
                        increasingly sophisticated. It would be a tragedy—an irreversible tragedy—if
                        this arms race extended into the field of nuclear weapons or nuclear weapons
                        delivery systems.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> emphasized these points
                        last month to Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName>
                        when he stressed the United States' concern that Israel's continued delay in
                        signing the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty will <pb n="626"
                            xml:id="pg_626" facs="0654"/>have the effect of increasing, rather than
                        reducing, pressures for other area states to develop or acquire nuclear
                        weapons.</p>
                    <p>We have carefully studied your Government's paper handed to Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_BW1">Barbour</persName> on October 28.<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d316fn3">See <ref target="#d292fn2">footnote 2, Document
                                292</ref>.</note> We welcome the reaffirmation of your Government's
                        assurances that Israel will not be the first to introduce nuclear weapons
                        into the area. It is our strong conviction, however, that with a
                        Non-Proliferation Treaty now in existence, only Israel's adherence to that
                        Treaty can give the world confidence that Israel does not intend to develop
                        nuclear weapons.</p>
                    <p>I therefore welcome the statement in your Government's paper that you are
                        engaged in intensive study of the implications of signing the Treaty. It is
                        my earnest hope that this study will result in a decision to sign the Treaty
                        at an early date. Israel's failure to sign the Non-Proliferation Treaty
                        would be a severe blow to my Government's global efforts to halt the spread
                        of nuclear weapons. The United States would also be deeply troubled if
                        operational strategic missiles were to appear in the Near East. I hope you
                        can give me an encouraging response on these matters when we talk later this
                        month.</p>
                    <p>It will be good to see you here. You are welcome not only as a distinguished
                        and esteemed colleague but as a close personal friend.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WPC1">Warnke</persName> opened the meeting by
                        saying that, as he had indicated in a previous discussion, we are interested
                        in substance and not form in the matters we have been addressing. We believe
                        it is your feeling that Israel will not and cannot accept our request for
                        advance assurances concerning strategic missiles and nuclear weapons as
                        preconditions to the contract. You propose alternative formulations to be
                        included in the contract which are essentially reaffirmations of earlier
                        agreements: not to use American aircraft to carry nuclear weapons, and not
                        to be the first to introduce nuclear weapons into the area. In our
                        discussions I believe I have made clear to you our interpretation of
                        “unusual and compelling circumstances” which would require that we cancel
                        the F-4 contract. The contract would provide that action inconsistent with
                        these assurances would constitute such circumstances. On these bases I
                        believe we can draft an agreement that will be acceptable to you and which
                        will meet your requirements—although not fully meeting mine.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WPC1">Warnke</persName> observed that he could not
                        find in the record any understanding of what Israel means by the provision:
                        “Israel will not be the first to introduce nuclear weapons into the area.”
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WPC1">Warnke</persName> asked the Ambassador what
                        was meant by this term?</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> said that “it means
                        what we have said, namely, that we would not be the first to introduce

                        are. What is your definition of nuclear weapons?” Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_WPC1">Warnke</persName> said that there are two aspects to
                        the question: the definition of what is and what is not a nuclear weapon,
                        and what is and what is not introduction into the area. Regarding the first,
                        if there are components available that could be assembled to make a nuclear
                        weapon—although part A may be in one room and part B in another room—then
                        that is a nuclear weapon. As for introduction, that is your term and you
                        will have to define it. Does it mean no physical presence? Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> said, “I suppose so.”</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WPC1">Warnke</persName> said: “what if you have
                        access to nuclear weapons that are in another country? Is that then
                        ‘introduction’”? Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName>
                        asked if we believed that this was the situation. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_WPC1">Warnke</persName> replied that he was just trying to
                        find the Israeli definition. He noted that the same situation could apply
                        the other way around: for example, what if another country in the area had
                        access to nuclear weapons but had not brought them in? Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> said, continuing the example, that
                        if China said they had nuclear weapons for Egypt stored in China, he didn't
                        know what the Israeli reaction would be. He hasn't given the matter a great
                        deal of thought. He believed that “introduction” would require their
                        physical presence in the area.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HBGM1">Hod</persName> asked if the term
                        “introduction” had an accepted usage in international law. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_WPC1">Warnke</persName> replied that it had not. General
                            <persName corresp="#p_HBGM1">Hod</persName> said that throughout the
                        world the experience was that introduction of a weapon could only mean after
                        testing. You could not introduce a weapon until after it actually became a
                        weapon.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> asked: “Do you
                        consider a nuclear weapon one that has not been tested, and has been done by
                        a country without previous experience”? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WPC1"
                            >Warnke</persName>: “Certainly. China with a strategic missile
                        capability would be assumed to have nuclear weapons even had it not tested
                        these weapons.” Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName>
                        said: “All nuclear powers-the United States, Russia, the United Kingdom,
                        France, China—have tested nuclear weapons. Do you really believe
                        introduction comes before testing”? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SHH2"
                            >Schwartz</persName> said that what the Ambassador was talking about is
                        reliability. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName>
                        disagreed saying that based on his experience with conventional weapons, he
                        would not consider a weapon that had not been tested to be a weapon.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WPC1">Warnke</persName> asked whether, if the
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> had missiles with nuclear war heads
                        but had not actually tested them, would Israel consider that the <gloss
                            target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> had not introduced nuclear weapons? He said
                        that testing by other nuclear powers is very relevant to a potential nuclear
                        power if the latter is developing weapons based on existing technology.</p>
                    <pb n="629" xml:id="pg_629" facs="0657"/>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> said that, “weapons
                        serve policy, not vice versa. Since the <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                        >UAR</gloss>'s goal is to destroy us I would take it with very great
                        concern. Our policy is not to destroy the <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                            >UAR</gloss>. You must combine the weapon with the policy.” General
                            <persName corresp="#p_HBGM1">Hod</persName> observed that a very good
                        example of introduction was when Egypt introduced missiles into the area in
                        1963, claiming they were capable of hitting anything south of Beirut.
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> said: “My concern
                        with Egypt is with missiles with chemical rather than nuclear war heads. If
                        Egypt were to hit our densely populated areas, even in a limited way, it
                        could be disastrous.”</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WPC1">Warnke</persName> said, as he understood it,
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> applied two
                        prerequisites to the word “introduction”—notoriety and pretesting.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName>, saying that “I
                        don't know what the Prime Minister said, but” there must be public
                        acknowledgment. The purpose of nuclear weapons is not to use the weapon
                        itself, but to use their deterrent power. “I don't believe any powers that
                        have nuclear weapons plan to use them, although you cannot ever be sure.”
                        Ninety-nine per cent of their value is deterrence. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_SHH2">Schwartz</persName> said: “You mean deterrence against
                        governments, to deter governments from specific actions.” Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> agreed: “The fact that you
                        have got it must be known.”</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WPC1">Warnke</persName> said that the Ambassador
                        also introduced the factor of intent: if the <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                            >UAR</gloss> has missiles, Israel would be concerned; if Israel has
                        them, there is no cause for concern. The purpose of strategic missiles for
                        Israel would be for deterrence.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> said: “You are
                        trying to combine strategic missiles and nuclear war heads. This is not
                        necessary in the Middle East. To my mind, in the Middle East, missiles with
                        war heads which are not nuclear weapons can play a role.” Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_WPC1">Warnke</persName> asked, “What sort of role”?
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> said: “It depends
                        on the other side. What we are concerned about in Egypt is their chemical
                        warfare capability. As I explained in 1963 when I was here, one of our
                        thoughts was that Egyptian missiles, even with conventional war heads, might
                        contribute to their success if they made a surprise attack on our cities.
                        They could interfere with the mobilization system under such circumstances,
                        and this might play a great role in determining the outcome. Seventy per
                        cent more or less of Army capability, although less for the Air Force, is
                        based on mobilization, not just on manpower but vehicles, transport,
                        supplies, and so forth. During the six day war we had mobilized so much of
                        the resource of our cities that we had to devote a portion of our military
                        effort to resupplying the cities.”</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HBGM1">Hod</persName> observed that Egypt has
                        sea borne (Styx) missiles with 35 mile range and may have or may be
                        receiving even more sophisticated missiles. Although these have a short
                        range, they can be <pb n="630" xml:id="pg_630" facs="0658"/>used
                        sea-to-shore as well as sea-to-sea, and therefore can raise havoc with
                        coastal cities such as Tel Aviv.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> said that they had
                        heard of a plan, although they could not know for certain, to sell to Egypt
                        missile destroyers with missiles of about 100 miles range which, although
                        normally sea-to-sea, could also be used sea-to-shore. <persName
                            corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> said Israel was worried that Egypt
                        might launch sea borne missiles during the six day war, “but they did not
                        dare to do this.” <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> said he also
                        understands that there is a Cannon missile on the TU-16s now in Egypt that
                        can hit the centers of our cities. “Therefore, we look at missiles somewhat
                        differently than you. It is not necessary to have nuclear war heads on our
                        missiles. There are war heads between high-explosive and nuclear.”</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WPC1">Warnke</persName> said: “Then in your view,
                        an unadvertised, untested nuclear device is not a nuclear weapon.”
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> said: “Yes, that is
                        correct.” Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WPC1">Warnke</persName> asked: “What
                        about an advertised but untested nuclear device or weapon. Would that be
                        introduction?” Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName>
                        said: “Yes, that would be introduction.” Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WPC1"
                            >Warnke</persName> said he would interpret mere physical presence in the
                        area as constituting, in itself, “introduction”.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WPC1">Warnke</persName> concluded the discussion by
                        saying that he would talk with Mr. Hoopes, that we would have a Memorandum
                        of Understanding prepared within a few days incorporating the provisions we
                        have discussed, and that General <persName corresp="#p_HBGM1">Hod</persName>
                        could in the meantime meet with the Air Force to continue the technical
                        discussions that we are at this time prepared to go ahead with. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_WPC1">Warnke</persName> said that we ought to
                        continue these discussions so that we might try to arrive at some
                        understanding between us as to the problems of missiles and nuclear weapons.
                        At this time, with respect to “introduction,” Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_WPC1">Warnke</persName> said there was not much clarity and
                        no agreement.</p>

                    <p rend="flushleft">Dear Mr. <persName>President</persName>:</p>
                    <p>In May, 1968, my terms of reference as your coordinator on the Israeli power
                        and desalting project were approved, and you said in a letter to me dated
                        May 6<note n="2" xml:id="d319fn2">Not found.</note> that I was “to feel free
                        to manage this in the way that makes the most sense.”</p>
                    <p>I have attempted to be responsive to the terms of reference, although I have
                        also proceeded in this complicated and highly sensitive problem as seemed to
                        make the most sense to me in the present circumstances. My observations,
                        conclusions and recommendations have been transmitted in the form of a
                        memorandum to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt W. Rostow</persName>, a
                        copy of which is enclosed.<note n="3" xml:id="d319fn3">Also dated November
                            12, not printed.</note> The principal recommendation is to concentrate
                        on a 40-million-gallon-per-day (MGD) water desalting plant in Israel; and,
                        in my judgment, work on this should proceed as a matter of priority if the
                        goal of massive desalting-plant capability is to be achieved within the next
                        ten to fifteen years.</p>
                    <p>I applaud your desire to lay as much groundwork as possible for progress in
                        desalting, to paraphrase your May 6 letter, and the above recommendation is
                        put forward with this objective in mind. With the knowledge and experience
                        which will accumulate with the construction and operation of a medium-sized
                        desalting plant, it will be possible to see more clearly down the road
                        toward the 100 MGD projects and, ultimately, toward the even larger plants
                        of the future.</p>

                            corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> called in Israeli Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> November 12 for review of
                        recent US contacts, in context <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>
                        Mission, with <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and Soviets. Under
                        Secretary also expressed our concern at indications <gloss target="#t_GOI1"
                            >GOI</gloss> thinking in terms of peace settlement involving territorial
                        acquisitions by Israel in Sinai and West Bank—a position we could not
                        support. Under Secretary said we have based our position on understanding
                        that Israel seeks adequate security arrangements and recognition of
                        boundaries but, leaving aside Jerusalem and Gaza as special problems, seeks
                        no territory from <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and only minor
                        adjustments, with compensation, in pre-June 1967 lines with Jordan. At same
                        time Under Secretary made clear we continue firmly support position that
                        Israel should only withdraw in context of contractually binding peace
                        settlement embodying clear guarantees for Israel's security and navigation
                        rights, termination of belligerency and recognition of Israeli boundaries.
                            <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> argued that Israel's
                        security requirements dictated some territorial changes and expressed view
                        that position outlined by Under Secretary represented change in US stand;
                        Israel was being asked make further concessions and its bargaining position
                        was being undermined while <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> had given no
                        indication it wanted peace. Under Secretary said our position was that
                        settlement must be agreed among parties and we had therefore avoided
                        expressing views on specifics. Nevertheless, we had consistently made clear
                        we could not go along with Israeli efforts acquire Arab territory, given our
                        long standing policy of support for territorial integrity of all states of
                        area. <hi rend="italic">End summary</hi>.</p>

                        <item>Under Secretary reported that Soviets have been interested in
                            continuing discussion with <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>. We
                            remain willing carry on dialogue with Soviets, making clear that it must

                            Dialogue so far had not gone far beyond our expressing concern re slow
                            pace of <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> Mission and
                            inquiring of Soviets how they thought <pb n="634" xml:id="pg_634"

                            following lines, noting that we did not consider it totally negative:
                            Riad had said <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> wanted <persName
                                corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> to continue but had expressed
                            concern that Israel not prepared to withdraw from Egyptian territory to
                            pre-June 5 lines. Secretary had stressed that withdrawal to
                            international borders must be in context of state of peace and had noted
                            that while <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> said it wanted peace, it
                            had given no concrete ideas re kind of peace document it would accept.
                            Riad had indicated <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> would sign some
                            kind of document but had said neither that it would nor that it would
                            not sign same document as Israel. Secretary had emphasized view that
                                <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> should sign document to which
                            Israel would also be signatory. He had also said that Resolution in our
                            view was not self-executing and details would have to be negotiated. Re
                            refugees, Secretary had stressed need for solution based on individual
                            and secret refugee choice without results of that choice being binding
                            in advance on any state. (Under Secretary noted in this connection
                            Secretary's view that not many refugees would choose repatriation to
                            Israel if choice were truly personal and secret.) Finally Secretary had
                            stressed that there must be free passage through Straits of Tiran and
                            Suez Canal with some kind of international peace keeping machinery at
                            Sharm al-Shaykh. In stating these views to Riad, Secretary made clear he
                            could not speak for Israel and was presenting US ideas.</item>

                        <item>Under Secretary continued that, as we saw it, most difficult questions
                            related to territory on one hand and nature of peace on other. It was
                            difficult for <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and Jordan to say what
                            they meant by peace without their having an idea of Israel's views on
                            territorial question. On basis of our many discussions with <gloss
                                target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                            assumed Israel's position was that, in context of peace, it would
                            withdraw substantially to pre-June 5 lines, leaving aside Jerusalem and
                            Gaza which were special problems. We had assumed there need be no
                            changes with respect to <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and with
                            respect to Jordan only “really minor” changes on security grounds, with
                            compensation for Jordan. Arabs had interpreted Israel's concept of
                            changes for security reasons, however, as involving significant
                            territorial acquisitions by Israel. This caused problems for <gloss
                                target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>, given our basic position on
                            territorial integrity. We had held this position consistently without
                            going into details of how a peace settlement could be arranged. Instead,
                            in light of 1957 experience and origins <pb n="635" xml:id="pg_635"
                                facs="0663"/>of 1967 war, we had based our position on need for
                            peace agreed to among parties. As President made clear in his September
                            10 speech, however, we had assumed territorial question would be
                            resolved without transfer of significant areas to Israel. We recognized
                            that it would be difficult to devise adequate security arrangements but
                            believed this was possible without territorial transfers.</item>

                            <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> asked for
                            clarification—was it the US position that leaving Jerusalem aside,
                            Israel should withdraw to June 4 boundaries? Under Secretary said this
                            was our position, allowing for adjustments of the kind contemplated in
                            General Armistice Agreements, providing there were satisfactory security
                            arrangements and a context of peace. In response to <persName

                            him, Under Secretary said this had been our position throughout.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> had said as
                            much to King <persName>Hussein</persName> in November 1967 and had so
                            informed Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> at

                            <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> replied that Israel
                            believed secure and recognized boundaries would require some territorial
                            changes. Israel's guideline was security; it was not seeking real estate
                            for its own sake. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> had made
                            clear to Secretary that Israel did not interpret “withdrawal” to mean
                            withdrawal from <hi rend="italic">all</hi> occupied territories. With
                            respect to <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, Israel needed to provide
                            full protection for free passage through Straits of Tiran and would
                            require land communications to Sharm al-Shaykh and Israeli presence
                            there. Re Jordan, certain territorial changes would also be required but
                            their precise nature had not yet been decided, although principles
                            governing such changes had been agreed upon within <gloss
                                target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>. To counter Arab arguments that Israel
                            would not withdraw, Israel had been pressed to accept principle of
                            secure and recognized boundaries to be agreed upon among parties. Now
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> was asking Israel to accept
                            principle of settlement practically to June 4 lines even though <gloss
                                target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> had refused indicate that it wanted
                            peaceful settlement or that it would sign document with Israel. <gloss
                                target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> could now conclude that, having
                            succeeded in getting US to accept position that withdrawal should be to
                            pre-war lines without itself having given up anything, it should now see
                            what more it could get. <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> had made

                                target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> was seeking to erode the meaning of
                            peace. Furthermore, it was clear there was no US-Israeli understanding

                        <label>7.</label>
                        <item>Under Secretary replied that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> had
                            avoided speaking of June 4 lines since this would be misleading with
                            respect to Jerusalem and kind of adjustments we have in mind. To us the
                            words “recognized and secure” meant “security arrangements” and
                            “recognition” of new lines as international boundaries. We had never
                            meant that Israel could <pb n="636" xml:id="pg_636" facs="0664"/>extend
                            its territory to West Bank or Suez if this was what it felt its security
                            required. We had always thought new map would look very much like
                            pre-war map but with Israel's security assured. We had assumed Israel
                            had no territorial problems with <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                            >UAR</gloss>-only problems of security. If more than that was involved
                            then US and Israel would be on divergent courses. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> read relevant portion of General
                            Armistice Agreement to make point <gloss target="#t_GAA1">GAA</gloss>
                            placed no limitations whatever on territorial changes which could be
                            made. Under Secretary said if it was Israel's position that all
                            territories were negotiable, such position on Israel's part would
                            confront <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> with difficulties and we
                            could not support it. Putting aside Jerusalem, Gaza and Syrian Heights
                            for now, since they presented different kind of problem, we sought
                            security for Israel not territory.</item>

                            obtained contractual agreements plus termination of belligerency plus
                            recognition of boundaries, would Israel withdraw to the old

                            Israel would be satisfied. In response to Under Secretary's question
                            whether Israel sought permanent presence at Sharm al-Shaykh or simply
                            absence of any presence plus the right to assure the latter, <persName
                                corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> said the lesson of the early
                            1950s and of May 1967 was that there should be Israeli presence at Sharm
                            al-Shaykh. Otherwise, as experience had shown, <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                                >UAR</gloss> could deploy troops and thereby change situation
                            without firing a shot. This put onus on Israel to fire first which
                            caused it problems with big powers. Israel wanted to be in position to
                            prevent interference with its navigation without having to shoot. Israel
                            could not rely on <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and international
                            forces were of no use.</item>
                        <label>10.</label>
                        <item>Under Secretary said he thought clear cut arrangements for Israel's
                            security could be made—e.g., terms of settlement could provide that
                            presence of any country at Sharm al-Shaykh would be regarded as act of
                            war justifying self defense under Article 51 of <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> Charter. <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName>
                            responded that 1957 arrangements were almost that precise but violation
                            by <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> had only led to international
                            debate. Lawyer could always find counter arguments to any legal device.
                            In response to <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName>'s comment
                            that this line of Israeli reasoning undermined Israel's entire concept
                            of peace based on treaties, <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1"
                                >Rabin</persName> said there was big difference between violation of
                            boundaries, which would be clear to all and violation of security
                            arrangements, which could be interpreted in various ways. To cite
                            another example, <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> said
                            Jordan had promised <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> not to deploy

                        <item>Under Secretary said his main concern was that US and Israel not find
                            themselves on divergent courses. Having taken position that Israel had
                            no territorial demands if Arabs made peace, we would be in difficult
                            position if it developed this was not the case. Time might come when
                                <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> would feel he should
                            put forward proposals for settlement. Point had already been reached
                            where <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>, in pressing <gloss
                                target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> to be more forthcoming, had said we did
                            not anticipate territorial problems if <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                                >UAR</gloss> was prepared for peace. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1"
                                >Sisco</persName> noted that Israel had told us many times there

                            depended on fact of Israeli occupation, not on question of how much or

                            had agreed, in context of our discussion of Soviet approach in

                            with <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> had undermined Israel's

                            Israeli position was to seek territorial acquisitions. We had made clear
                            to <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> where we thought responsibility
                            for 1967 war lay and that our position as stated to <gloss
                                target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> was premised on need for peace.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> added that Israeli
                            bargaining position could not be undermined by US position based on
                            binding peace and fulfillment of Security Council Resolution; Israeli
                            leverage results from fact it is in occupied territories. US is not
                            asking Israel to withdraw to international boundary in circumstances
                            other than a satisfactory peace binding parties. Under Secretary
                            expressed hope we could now proceed to useful discussion with Israelis
                            of what the concept of peace means to Israel in specific terms.</item>

                                        Another says it can be set aside for the time being,

                                    <item>—One American says there's no such thing as “instant
                                        peace.” Another says Israel can withdraw when it gets a
                                        peace treaty because there will be peace then.</item>

                            <item>The US has undercut Israel's bargaining position without offering
                                anything in return. The US has “made concessions” to the Arabs

                            <item>The US is playing fast and loose with Israel's security without
                                taking Israel into its confidence. Worst of all, the US “will not
                                talk to us” about its view of what the Soviets are up to in the
                                Middle East. Israel physically faces Russians across the Canal;
                                they're “the real menace to Israel—physically breathing down our
                                necks.” Yet the US won't even tell the Israelis exactly what we
                                think Soviet objectives are. What's more, “we've watched how you
                                worked this deal with Vietnam and we're inclined to think there's
                                some sort of stratospheric deal with the Russians, maybe including
                                the Middle East. That just won't work with us.”</item>

                            <item>Above all, if the US wants Israel to take it seriously, it will
                                have to make clear what it means by peace. “To put it bluntly, we
                                don't have any confidence that you've thought through the
                                relationship that should exist after a settlement. Given your
                                ‘salami tactics’, we think you'll ask us to compromise next—now that
                                you've asked us to compromise on territories—on Israeli ships
                                through the Canal (you'll say Israeli cargoes in foreign bottoms are
                                OK); then you'll say we don't need a ‘peace treaty’; then you'll
                                tell us we're unrealistic in the way we define peace.”</item>

                    <p>Trying to respond in roughly parallel sequence to this extended oration, I
                        made the following points: <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>
                                <p>Our policy has not changed. We've talked consistently about
                                    territorial integrity (May 23 and June 19, 1967); about
                                    withdrawal (June 19); about Jordan getting the West Bank back
                                    (November 1967 to <persName>Hussein</persName> and <persName
                                        corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName>); about the inadmissibility
                                    of the conquest of territory by force (November 22); about
                                    boundary changes only as they're agreed in “honest negotiation”
                                    as parts of a “just compromise” not dominated by “the weight of
                                    conquest” (September 10, 1968). I said we had heard Israelis
                                    describe the Dayan plan, the <persName corresp="p_AY1"
                                        >Allon</persName> plan, the corridor-to-Sharm-el-Sheikh plan
                                    and the keep-all-of-Jerusalem plan. Each time we have heard one
                                    of these, we have said repeatedly and at all levels that none of
                                    these is good enough to produce peace. As a matter of principle,
                                    our position has been clear. What we are doing now is not to
                                    tell anybody where to draw his boundaries; we are saying very
                                    simply that it is a fact that there will be no peace if Israel
                                    tries to hold onto large chunks of territory.</p>
                                <p>I could not accept his charge of “salami tactics” for one very
                                    simple reason—our policy has not changed. If anything has
                                    changed, it has been a step-by-step Israeli perception of our
                                    position. We never agreed on direct negotiation (June 19:
                                    “exclude no method;” Shlomo acknowledged that.). We never agreed
                                    to their border schemes, but they never took us seriously; they
                                    just turned off their hearing aids. What has happened in the
                                    last 4-5 months is that the tactical situation has reached a
                                    crucial point where we could no longer afford to let the Israeli
                                    Government go on deluding itself that it had a blank check from
                                    the US.</p>
                                <p>This is especially important if negotiations with Jordan are
                                    coming to a head. Everything Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNB1"
                                        >Katzenbach</persName> had said about our territorial
                                    position on the Israel-<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                                    border applies in principle to the Israel-Jordan border, and if
                                    Israel plans to offer Jordan the <persName corresp="p_AY1"
                                        >Allon</persName> plan, we don't want anyone—especially the
                                    Israeli Government—to think the US will support that. We want
                                    Israel to know-as we told <persName corresp="p_AY1"
                                        >Allon</persName> here—that that's a non-starter.</p>

                            <item>On inconsistency, there's nothing inconsistent in saying that
                                Jerusalem is the “key issue” and in saying it's so difficult that it
                                may <pb n="640" xml:id="pg_640" facs="0668"/>have to be negotiated
                                apart from the rest of the territorial settlement.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>We haven't undercut Israel's bargaining position. Israel's main
                                bargaining counter is occupation. We haven't proposed to anyone that
                                Israel withdraw except to a condition of peace. But when two parties
                                are trying to start negotiating, their positions have to be
                                somewhere in the same ballpark—close enough so that it at least
                                seems remotely possible to bridge the gap between them. What we've
                                urged Israel to do is to drop the absolutely impossible and
                                untenable elements in its position to test whether the Egyptians
                                will come to meet a half-reasonable position. If they don't then
                                we'll at least know who stands where. But with Israel's position not
                                even in the ball park, there was no way to put Egypt to the
                                test.</item>

                            <item>We have taken Israel into our confidence. But frankly, we don't

                        we've changed our position and undermined Israel's bargaining position.</p>
                    <p>The fact is that this has been our consistent position for over a year, but
                        the Israelis have turned off their hearing aids on us. As for undermining
                        their position, we can't afford to go along with their bazaar haggling if
                        we're going to have any chance of peace. What's more, we really would have
                        undercut them if we had let them think we'd given them a blank check. It's
                        especially important as negotiations with Jordan reach a climax that they
                        know where we stand.</p>

                                believe the postponement was requested because of Israel's
                                difficulty in obtaining a Cabinet consensus on their negotiating

                        talks connected therewith were most remarkable episode in negative sense, in
                        US-Israel relations. Absurd for Israel and US to get into a dispute which
                        was not real, which concerned a third party which was not interested in
                        reaching agreement. Fact that US had expressed views to <gloss
                            target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        weakened Israel negotiating position. US formulation totally unacceptable to
                        Israel and conflicts with President's Sept. 10 speech. Previous US
                        statements had been broad and provided flexibility for interpretation, which
                        Israel had thought intended. Proposal had been made in Israeli Cabinet to
                        withdraw or at least not repeat <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
                        acceptance <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> resolution. International
                        presence at Sharm el-Sheikh would not be viable, and <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                            >UN</gloss> would have no power to keep it there. Private poll of
                        refugees would place individual desires above national sovereignty and not
                        acceptable to Israel. Contractual agreement which US talked of seriously
                        with <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> was referred to contemptuously as
                        mere piece of paper in talk with <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. US
                        alleged <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> policy had changed but this not
                        so. It was US views which had changed. <persName corresp="#p_EA1"
                            >Eban</persName> hoped to hear US policy remained as previously
                        delineated by President. Ambassador noted US policy remains as determined by
                        President and recent conversations not in conflict therewith. Keystone
                        remains agreement between parties and form of compact less important than
                            <pb n="645" xml:id="pg_645" facs="0673"/>substance. US involved because
                        extremely concerned over future of <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                            >Jarring</persName> Mission. If our moves did not achieve forward
                        movement toward settlement, they might at least smoke out Arab views. US had
                        talked only for itself and had not given away Israeli positions or made
                        negotiations more difficult. US supported idea that some presence needed at
                        Sharm el-Sheikh but not Israeli. Re refugees, US view was that not many
                        would opt to return and it no derogation of Israeli position to agree to
                        accept return of few. <hi rend="italic">End summary</hi>.</p>

                            and others constituted a most remarkable episode in our relations in a
                            negative sense. What the US had told Israel was not recognizable in
                            terms of our previous relations. Eban was puzzled why whole exercise
                            necessary. <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> was no closer to peace
                            than US was to putting man on moon (immediately corrected himself and
                            noted latter might be taking place soon). It was rather absurd for US
                            and Israel to be in dispute about something which was not real while the
                            other party concerned was not even interested. If Israel and the <gloss

                            might have understood US intervention. It was a serious matter that US
                            views had been put to <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> since this had weakened the

                            <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> continued that US formulation
                            was totally unacceptable to Israel. It appeared US had proposed or

                            which should apply to a settlement. One was that the <gloss

                            Israel agreed with this, and it had almost been accepted by <gloss
                                target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> which has stopped calling for

                                target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> territory. This certainly conflicts
                            with President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s speech
                            of Sept 10 in which President said US was not the one to say where
                            others should draw lines but that it was clear there should be no return
                            to June 4. Israel had no difficulty in accepting President's two points,
                            including idea that territory should not be gained simply by weight of
                            conquest, but what <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>
                            said was completely different. In all other US statements, June 4 had
                            been spoken of negatively as something to which we should not return,
                            but <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> had now said that
                            this is what should be returned to, with minor adjustments. This was
                            completely at variance with previous US pronouncements.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>Gravity of situation, <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName>
                            continued, was that Israel had placed great faith in President's
                            pronouncements and would like to be able to <pb n="646" xml:id="pg_646"
                                facs="0674"/>continue to do so. If they were broad statements which
                            provided flexibility for interpretation in previous US pronouncements,
                            Israel had assumed this had been intended by US. On this basis, Israel
                            had announced its acceptance of <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>
                            resolution in US identical words. Israel had done this because it
                            accepted the Nov. 15, 1967 statement by American <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> representative that neither 1948 nor 1967 lines were
                            boundaries and boundaries had to be agreed to by parties concerned. If
                            US meant Israel had to return to June 4 line, this could not be
                            accepted. There had been a proposal in Israeli Cabinet to withdraw
                            acceptance of resolution or at least not to repeat they accept. If US
                            position had remained a formula giving Israel room to maneuver this

                            In discussions in Washington it had been intimated that Israel's

                        <item>It was not true Israel's policy had changed, <persName
                                corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> said. Israel had not wanted to bind
                            itself to territorial changes before negotiations. He could not
                            understand why it was considered more moderate to formulate and transmit
                            positions in advance of negotiations. He had thought Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> agreed when he had said
                            that one should not start negotiations with the most flexible position
                            but with the hardest. Therefore Israel had told <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                                >UAR</gloss> through <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>
                            that security and navigation concerns would govern its positions. Israel
                            had no encyclopedic interest in Sinai but was functionally concerned
                            with security and navigation. Israel had not said anything about Suez
                            (though it wanted freedom of transit of Canal) since this was not linked
                            to territorial settlement. Nobody had showed Israel how anything other
                            than Israeli presence at Sharm el-Sheikh would provide security. It was
                            not true that Israel had now said this for the first time. <persName
                                corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> had made this position clear to the
                            Secretary and to <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName>. <persName
                                corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> had told Secretary in Sept Israeli
                            presence needed at Sharm el-Sheikh and this had been <persName
                                corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName>'s position in last talk with
                            Secretary. It certainly undermined Israeli negotiating position for
                            great power to tell <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> in advance they
                            could wash out Israel. US should let Egypt try to persuade Israel or
                            Israel to persuade Egypt how to dispose of this vital interest. <gloss

                            read too much into US talk with Riad. US policy still remains as
                            enunciated by President June 19 and Sept. 10. Keystone of our view is
                            insistence on necessity for agreement between parties. Form of contract
                            is minor compared with substantive content of agreement. On major points

                            Israel to go back to June 4. We had proposed some time ago that Israel

                            el-Sheikh and Gaza. Israel had not gone along with that proposal. Its
                            statement to <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> did not

                            virtually nowhere. We had stayed out of the negotiations except for
                            general statements of policy to which US still adhered. We had thought
                            that if we talked with <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> we could smoke them out even if we
                            did not achieve actual movement toward a settlement. He did not think US
                            had given away Israel's position or had made negotiations more
                            difficult. We were working for peace and peace was in Israel's
                            interests. Our insistence on agreement meant insistence on negotiations.
                            We do have a definite difference of opinion on Sharm el-Sheikh. We
                            envisaged support for arrangements for Israel's freedom of navigation
                            through Tiran Strait, but do not support these arrangements being made

                            says it would agree to on Tiran Strait, there would have been no war
                            last year. In any event, US had not repeated Israeli positions to <gloss
                                target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> but its own, but he did not think these
                            positions so different. Appreciate <persName corresp="#p_EA1"
                                >Eban</persName>'s concern in tight negotiating position. On other

                            are not interested in settlement at all, it would make no difference
                            anyway. Safeguard for Israel's position was still necessity for
                            agreement between parties. US was not introducing solution of its

                            had never been agreement as to number of refugees who would want to come
                            back to Israel. There were many reasons why refugees had left Israel,
                            including unwillingness to live under Israeli state, and giving them
                            choice would not erase reasons why they had left to begin with.
                                <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> said there was difference
                            between making this proposal to Israel and making it to Arabs. We were

                            that something had to be introduced into equation and this is what US
                            had tried to do. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> replied it
                            meaningful that Riad packed up and went home few days after hearing US
                            presentation. He continued that US had not talked with Israel about
                            signing “some piece of paper” but about a permanent contractual
                            arrangement binding on both parties for peace. <gloss target="#t_Amb1"

                            which Israel was signatory indicated Riad also had something else in
                            mind other than a contractual undertaking between <gloss

                            understand US proposal in same way Israel had done. <persName

                            and <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName>) had come to Israel and
                            said throw out some bait to <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> on
                            procedural matters. Israel had done so. Then US had come again to Israel
                            and said throw out more bait. Fon Minister had done so. Then, instead of
                            waiting for <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> to respond, US had
                            proceeded to throw out more bait of its own, while other side had not
                            moved an inch. On Nov 7 <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> had stated
                            its position precisely: Israel must liquidate aggression and withdraw.
                            In face of these concepts of enemy, US had carried Israel further along

                            the Arab states. We felt condition of non-belligerency and stability
                            necessary which could develop over time into real peace. Peace was in
                            interest of both Israel and US and US was not undermining Israel's

                                >UAR</gloss> he thought he could have persuaded US differently. He
                            would not have asked US to follow Israel's policy but would have asked

                                >Amb</gloss> noted we had also sought consultation in advance with

                            he had given Secretary full account in advance and had followed US

                            were suddenly reformulated. He would like to be able to inform his

                                    emphasize his loss of freedom, he said, first, he had to listen
                                    to the Soviets and, second, if he was going to continue to get
                                    financial support from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Libya, he had
                                    been told that he had to abide by the Khartoum agreement which
                                    in effect said there would be no negotiation and no declaration
                                    of non-belligerency. (Donor countries would welcome pretext to

                            have direct negotiation, either secretly or openly. He insists he has to
                            have a timetable and some kind of a map that would show what boundary
                            adjustments are being contemplated before he can “do a selling job" even
                            to his own people. He believes that if any move of his is termed to be
                            capitulation, he will lose support of the army and without the army he
                            would lose his own control of the country.</item>

                            because he didn't trust them and, second, because if he made an
                            agreement with some part of Israeli Government they would be undercut by
                            other political segments in Israel who are competing in next spring

                            attack and absence of some other people who are not so interested in
                            peace, next two or three weeks are going to be crucial in decisions

                            <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName>'s statements <pb n="654"

                            Aviv 6152 are somewhat disconcerting. When I saw King
                                <persName>Hussein</persName> on November 9 (Amman 7409), I read to
                            him the following sentences from the memorandum on the “U.S. position as
                            presented to <persName>Hussein</persName> on November 6, 1967.” “The
                            United States, as a matter of policy, does not envisage a Jordan which
                            consists only of the East Bank. The United States is prepared to support
                            a return of the West Bank to Jordan with minor boundary rectifications.
                            However, the United States would use its influence to obtain
                            compensation to Jordan for any territory it is required to give up. For
                            example, if Jordan is required to give up the Latroun salient, the
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> will use its influence to obtain
                            in compensation access for Jordan to a Mediterranean port in Israel.
                            Finally, although as a matter of policy we do not agree with Jordan's
                            position on Jerusalem, nor do we agree with the Israeli position on
                            Jerusalem, we are prepared to use our influence to obtain for Jordan a
                            role in Jerusalem. In short, we are prepared to make a maximum effort to
                            obtain for Jordan the best possible deal in terms of settlement with
                            Israel.”</item>

                        <item>The territorial assurances that we have given
                                <persName>Hussein</persName> are manifestly inconsistent with any
                            proposal that would place “certain unpopulated areas of West Bank" under
                            Israeli sovereignty or jurisdiction. The relevance of “unpopulated
                            areas" to “minor border rectifications" is, of course, another moot
                            point. (Incidentally, the Jordan Govt's 1961 maps on the “distribution
                            of population" and “population density" show very graphically that the
                            only “unpopulated areas" on the West Bank lie along the present
                            ceasefire line between Israel and Jordan. These maps are in vol. 4 of

                            published by the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics in 1967.) As I
                            read para 1 of Tel Aviv 6152, <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName>
                            seems to be saying that Israel has suggested to
                                <persName>Hussein</persName> some kind of variation of the <persName
                                corresp="p_AY1">Allon</persName> plan, which we have already
                            indicated is unacceptable in principle both to US and to Jordan. What
                                <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> appears to be asking of
                            Jordan is certainly “significantly" different even if not “violently"
                            different from the territorial assurances we have given Jordan.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>I do not know what the Israelis may have proposed to Jordan beyond the
                            generalities occasionally passed on to us by <persName corresp="#p_EA1"
                                >Eban</persName> and others, nor do we know
                                <persName>Hussein</persName>'s reaction to any specific territorial
                            proposals Israel may have made. The King and senior GOJ officials
                            continue to take the line with me that the Israelis have never been
                            specific with them about territory and I, of course, have not probed
                            them regarding this matter. Nevertheless, because of the territorial
                            assurances we have recently reiterated to <persName>Hussein</persName>,
                            I would strongly doubt that he <pb n="655" xml:id="pg_655" facs="0683"
                            />would feel he should entertain seriously any Israeli proposal that
                            either specifically or in principle provided “certain unpopulated areas
                            of West Bank to remain as Israeli territory.” I am convinced that
                            anything like that is a non-starter with the King. Even if he accepted
                            it, I do not believe he could bring along other Jordanians with
                            him.</item>

                            aware of the foregoing. I review the matter primarily to underline my
                            hope that we will be very firm in letting the Israelis know (1) we
                            intend to stand by the territorial assurances we have given to Jordan
                            and (2) our expectation that they will proceed as soon as possible to
                            give the Jordanians acceptable territorial specifics as part of a
                            peaceful settlement.</item>

                            handwritten note on the memorandum indicates that Secretary <persName

                            President.</note> He said that there is a paragraph in that memorandum
                        which looks to the Government of Israel as “quite awkward.” <persName
                            corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> said that the awkwardness was “not
                        because of its practical implications" but because of the way it is
                        worded.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> read a portion of
                        the paragraph in question: “It is understood by the Government of Israel
                        that action contrary to any of the understandings specified in paragraph II
                        of this memorandum shall constitute 'unusual and compelling circumstances'
                        and shall permit the United States to recover any aircraft already delivered
                        under this Agreement.” <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> said
                        that his Government could not accept that the United States could ask for
                        such language. “There is no precedent. It creates something that I don't
                        believe that exists anywhere.” <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName>
                        said that the paragraph implied that the United States considered Israel
                        “the bad guy" and that it did not believe the undertakings made by the
                        Government of Israel, and therefore this paragraph was worded as it is.</p>
                    <pb n="657" xml:id="pg_657" facs="0685"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WPC1">Warnke</persName> took issue with Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName>'s statement. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_WPC1">Warnke</persName> said that he had talked with Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_CCM1">Clifford</persName>, and Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_CCM1">Clifford</persName> in turn with Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, and the United States Government
                        clearly did not put such a construction on this paragraph. The United States
                        does believe the undertakings made by the Government of Israel. “I believe
                        you and what you have said.” It is quite natural, however, that Israel would
                        look after its own national security requirements. It would be
                        understandable for Israel to enter into an F-4 agreement now and later feel
                        compelled to change its mind for reasons existing at that time. It would not
                        be unusual in international agreements for undertakings previously made to
                        prove improvident in the future. But the United States for its part must
                        look after its own national security interests; if Israel were to decide at
                        some point that it could not adhere to the provisions of the agreement, it
                        would revert to status quo ante. That is the purpose of this paragraph.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> said he couldn't
                        understand why, for example, the United States could ask in ten years for
                        these aircraft to be returned. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WPC1"
                            >Warnke</persName> said: “Suppose you deliver nuclear weapons in these
                        aircraft in ten years time?”</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WPC1">Warnke</persName> said that what was put in
                        the Memorandum of Understanding, after all, represents only the summation of
                        our discussions. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName>
                        said that he had not agreed to commitments in the contract; he said that
                        Israel had agreed to reaffirm its previous understandings—that they would
                        not be the first to introduce nuclear weapons or carry nuclear weapons on
                        U.S. aircraft. “Why do you want us to do this?”</p>
                    <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_AS1">Argov</persName> said: “We feel we are on
                        parole.” The Israeli Government is giving assurances, said <persName
                            corresp="#p_AS1">Argov</persName>, but the paragraph presumes we will
                        not live up to them. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1"
                            >Rabin</persName> said that it isn't the standard paragraph.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WPC1">Warnke</persName> disagreed that there was a
                        “presumption" in the contract that Israel would not live up to its
                        assurances. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WPC1">Warnke</persName> also disagreed
                        with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName>'s statement
                        that this wasn't a standard paragraph. “There is no such thing as a standard
                        contract.” Each one varies. A past contract is not a binding precedent for
                        future contracts.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName>, somewhat
                        apologetically, said that his instructions were to follow the former
                        wording. He said also that, although he agreed with the form of the U.S.
                        proposal (i.e., a memorandum of understanding), “my Government has had
                        second thoughts" and prefers the same format as in the Skyhawk Agreement: “I
                        send you a letter, you send me a letter.”</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WPC1">Warnke</persName> observed that we had the
                        form of a Memorandum of Understanding before, in the Skyhawk Agreement.
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName>
                        <pb n="658" xml:id="pg_658" facs="0686"/>said he thought not. Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_AS1">Argov</persName> said that yes, at the time
                        in 1965 of the visit of Mr. <persName>HARRIMAN</persName> and Mr.
                            <persName>Komer</persName>, there was a Memorandum of Understanding:
                        “You participated in its development Mr. Ambassador.” Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> agreed and said that that was the
                        HARRIMAN Mission, which was a different matter.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WPC1">Warnke</persName> observed that that was the
                        point he was trying to make: there are different matters and different
                        circumstances that now exist. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WPC1"
                            >Warnke</persName> said that he understood that what Israel wanted now
                        wasn't a Memorandum of Understanding but an exchange of letters; for this he
                        had no instructions, and would have to discuss the matter with Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_CCM1">Clifford</persName>. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_WPC1">Warnke</persName> also asked the Ambassador whether he
                        had a letter to submit. The Ambassador passed him the Israeli letter
                            (attached).<note n="3" xml:id="d330fn3">Not printed.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SHH2">Schwartz</persName> suggested that Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> not press the A-4 analogy
                        too far, that it consisted of a number of documents, not just an exchange of
                        letters, and that it was negotiated under different circumstances. For
                        example, it contained an agreement that Israel would not come back to the
                        United States for planes for five years.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HBGM1">Hod</persName> observed that the
                        President, when Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName>
                        was here, was willing to overlook the five year clause. Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> said that the United States didn't
                        say anymore that it would not be a major supplier; the formulation of the
                        communique issued at the Ranch in 1968 was different from that of 1965. In
                        1965 it said that the United States would not be a major supplier; it did
                        not say that in 1968, but said instead that the United States would keep
                        Israel's defense requirements under review in light of the situation in the
                        area.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WPC1">Warnke</persName> said that the Ambassador's
                        remarks were not inconsistent with what Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SHH2"
                            >Schwartz</persName> had just said. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SHH2"
                            >Schwartz</persName> said that the 1965 precedent (of the Skyhawk)
                        didn't apply.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WPC1">Warnke</persName> said he would discuss the
                        latest Israel proposal with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CCM1"
                            >Clifford</persName>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WPC1">Warnke</persName>
                        asked Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> if he wished
                        to sign the letter. <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> did.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> said that there is a
                        third problem. He laughingly said that he assumed we would overcome the
                        “technical difficulties" of getting a satisfactory agreement in an
                        acceptable form. <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> said:
                        “Everyone has his own superiors.” <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1"
                            >Rabin</persName> asked if we could proceed with the technical talks
                        while waiting to sort out the basic agreement.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WPC1">Warnke</persName> said that the problem won't
                        arise, for he expects to respond to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1"
                            >Rabin</persName> the first of next week. General <persName
                            corresp="#p_HBGM1">Hod</persName> interjected <pb n="659"
                            xml:id="pg_659" facs="0687"/>that what he needs to know is what specific
                        equipment can be included on the F-4 aircraft and its approximate cost, so
                        that he can draw up a list of his specific requirements for the <gloss

                        Offer. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRJ1">Murray</persName> said that he would
                        review this and call General <persName corresp="#p_HBGM1">Hod</persName> on
                        the telephone.</p>

                    <p>On November 26, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName>
                        called me and reported that he had received my letter<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d332fn2">
                            <ref target="#d333">Document 333</ref>.</note> in reply to his letter
                        requesting that the United States Government sell 50 F-4 Phantoms to

                            <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName>'s November 22 letter to
                                <persName corresp="#p_WPC1">Warnke</persName> requested the sale of
                            the aircraft, together with related armament, ammunition, training,
                            spare parts, and other related services. The letter reaffirmed Israeli
                            commitment not to be the first power in the Middle East to introduce
                            nuclear weapons, and agreed not to use any U.S.-supplied aircraft as a
                            nuclear weapons carrier. (Washington National Records Center, <gloss

                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> said that the
                        letter posed no problems for him except for the reference to the
                        interpretation of the United States Government as to what would constitute
                        the introduction of nuclear weapons by a Middle East power.</p>
                    <pb n="660" xml:id="pg_660" facs="0688"/>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> said that he
                        understood from our second conversation that we would not incorporate a
                        definition of this term. I pointed out that this discussion had occurred in
                        the context of an anticipated Memorandum of Understanding, to be subscribed
                        by both parties. With a Memorandum of Understanding it would be necessary to
                        arrive at an agreed upon interpretation and our conversation had made it
                        clear that this was unlikely. I commented further that the existence of such
                        differences of opinion had, as I understood it, been the reason for his
                        proposal of an exchange of letters in lieu of a Memorandum of Understanding.
                        I also commented that, as Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1"
                            >Rabin</persName> had noted in our last conference on Friday, neither of
                        us was responsible for the content of the other's letter.</p>
                    <p>I pointed out further that the interpretation of the United States Government
                        was not directed exclusively at the circumstances under which Israel would
                        be deemed to have introduced nuclear weapons into the Middle East but that
                        it applied equally to the eventuality of such action by any other Middle
                        Eastern power. In the event that another Middle Eastern power should acquire
                        possession and control of nuclear weapons then this would relieve the
                        Government of Israel from the restrictions of its announced policy.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> said that he
                        recognized that our position was equally applicable to other Middle Eastern
                        powers and asked again if I thought this paragraph should remain in the
                        letter. I said that I did and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1"
                            >Rabin</persName> said “all right.”</p>
                    <p>In response to my question as to how the negotiations are proceeding,
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> said that General
                            <persName corresp="#p_HBGM1">Hod</persName> had met yesterday with Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_SHH2">Schwartz</persName> and had presented a list
                        of the items desired in order that an appropriate letter of offer could be
                        prepared. He also commented that he might want to talk with me at the end of
                        the week with regard to the delivery schedule. I said that I would be free
                        to see him on Friday.</p>

                            This conclusion was not challenged by anyone at the <gloss

                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>The draft went on to outline three alternative policies which the
                            United States Government might follow given the impasse. Very briefly
                                <pb n="663" xml:id="pg_663" facs="0691"/>these were: (a) put real
                            pressure on Israel to negotiate an agreement consistent with the
                            reasonable meaning of the words of the 22 November 1967 Security Council
                            resolution; (b) publicly support such a settlement in order to improve
                            our position with the Arabs, but do not bring pressure on Israel to go
                            along, thus virtually ensuring that no progress would in fact be made;
                            and (c) continue as at present to back the Israeli position while urging
                            Israel to be more flexible in both procedure and substance.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>Assistant Secretary Hart expressed the opinion, which was generally
                            supported by the <gloss target="#t_IRG1">IRG</gloss> members, that a
                            better format than presenting “alternatives" would be to explain our
                            present posture and then outline progressive “steps" which might be
                            taken to increase the prospects for an Arab-Israel settlement. He felt
                            our present policy included many points of difference with Israel which
                            should be mentioned, while admitting that in spite of these differences
                            we are putting no meaningful pressure on Israel to change its stand
                            where we disagree with it. The “steps" open to us all lead in the
                            direction of withdrawing the blank check which Israel now holds from us,
                            in order to move Israel toward a reasonable implementation of the
                            Security Council resolution. An early one would be to advise Israel
                            privately that if no progress is made toward implementation we would
                            support some form of mediation or arbitration. Making a public statement
                            to this effect would be a further step. An ultimate drastic step would
                            be our actual active participation in an international effort to
                            interpret and compel compliance with the Security Council
                            resolution.</item>

                                >IRG</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss>, influenced by
                            recent policy decisions in regard to aid to Biafra, favored a
                            recommendation that the Arab refugee problem be cut loose from the rest
                            of the Arab-Israel confrontation, and that we try to make progress on
                            this issue as a separate matter. The general consensus was that the
                            humanitarian aspect of the Arab refugee problem was completely
                            subordinate to international political considerations, and that this was
                            not a practical proposal. I expect, however, that the paper which
                            eventually goes to the Under Secretary may contain some reference to
                            this proposal, perhaps presenting it as a step which we might consider
                            taking.</item>

                            <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> prior to his December 2
                        meeting with <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>, making clear you
                        doing so on instructions. In view of the number and detailed discussions we
                        have had with <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> in recent days, and fact
                        that they are clear as to what our position is in relationship to <persName
                            corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> Mission and our desire to make
                        progress, we leave to your discretion how best to get across to the Israelis
                        our continuing feeling that they should put forward positive posture in this
                        next round. In the course of your conversation, you might make clear that
                        for our part we have been pressing both <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                            >USSR</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> with a view to
                        trying to get <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> to be more
                        explicit on concept of peace, which of course is of primary interest to
                        GOI.</p>
                    <p>2. From <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName>'s conversation with
                            <persName corresp="#p_TY1">Tekoah</persName> in New York on
                            Tuesday,<note n="2" xml:id="d335fn2">November 26.</note> we have the
                        impression Israelis very relaxed-much more relaxed than we are-regarding
                            <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>'s willingness to serve for
                        an indefinite period. We are pleased that he is having another round in the
                        area and apparently plans further discussions after Christmas vacation in
                        Moscow. While <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> is no longer
                        talking about wanting to sign off in the next weeks, our distinct impression
                        is that he will not stay on indefinitely in circumstances where prospects
                        for progress are very bleak.</p>
                    <p>3. Anything you can get of a specific character regarding where matters stand
                        on Jordanian side of settlement would also be helpful to the
                            Department.<note n="3" xml:id="d335fn3">Telegram 280086 to Tel Aviv,

                            viewed it as important for Israel to make suggestions to <persName

                            <p>“It is an expression of an intention which is to a considerable

                                the continuation of these terrorist raids is not profitable and
                                could lead to a buildup of hostilities. We will continue to do
                                everything we can, and get others to bring their influence to bear
                                to reduce these incidents, because it makes it more difficult to get
                                an atmosphere in which a peaceful settlement will follow.</p>
                            <p>“The possibilities of a peaceful settlement are being fully explored
                                by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>. I wish,

                                Governments of the States directly concerned to see if he can get

                    <p>The Secretary added that for a long time there had been an obstacle on the
                        procedural points. He said Israel has insisted upon talking directly with
                        the Arab Governments in a direct negotiation face-to-face. He noted that the
                        Arabs have indicated they would not do that <pb n="666" xml:id="pg_666"
                            facs="0694"/>and would only negotiate indirectly or discuss these

                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said that in recent
                        weeks Israel had taken two important steps. On the one side they have
                        actually taken up with Amb. <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>
                        various points of substance having to do with a peaceful settlement, opening
                        the way for indirect talks which the Arabs apparently have been saying they
                        want to see.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> continued: <quote

                            <p>“We are disappointed that the Arab side has not been more responsive
                                to this change in attitude on the part of Israel. It has not been
                                willing to talk seriously with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                                    >Jarring</persName> about the particular points of substance
                                more than you have heard thus far.</p>
                            <p>“Secondly, Israel has now been talking about the need for a
                                contractual settlement of the situation and has taken the emphasis
                                off the term 'peace treaty.' This should open the way for a somewhat
                                less formal arrangement, which would nevertheless bind all the
                                parties but would be more congenial to Arab sensitivities. Again,
                                that has not met very much response.”</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that along with this issue there was the deep feeling
                        among many Arabs that Israel is bent upon territorial expansion and
                        similarly a deep feeling on the part of the Israelis that the Arabs are bent
                        upon the destruction of Israel. That deep emotional commitment on both sides
                        obviously gets in the way of a peaceful settlement.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“I think it is fair to point out that there are internal political
                                problems on both sides. Some of the Arab leaders may well feel that
                                if they take a dramatic step toward peace, they will be subject to
                                assassination, and it may well be true that they do face such a
                                problem. And there are internal debates going on in Israel today
                                which make the position of the Prime Minister very difficult if he
                                should translate dramatic moves toward peace on his side. So we may
                                have one of those situations where the parties feel internally too
                                weak to be wise. Unless there's some unusual experience in
                                diplomacy, that does complicate the situation.”</p>

                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> commented that
                        fortunately, Amb. <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> was going to
                        serve further and is going to continue his efforts but that we needed the
                        help, however, of the other powers, including the help of the Soviet Union.
                        He reported that just yesterday <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi> issued a
                        statement which was highly polemical in content, which associated Israel
                        with the imperialist forces, which are supposed to be the bugaboo in the
                        communist world. He said it did, however, point to Soviet support for the
                        November resolution in the Security Council and support for Amb. <persName

                        although outside powers cannot settle this situation among themselves in the
                        positive form, we could hope that all outside powers, including the U.S. and
                        the U.S.S.R. and others would bring [all?] their influence to bear that they
                        could on the parties, to try to get the parties to be more cooperative in
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>'s movement toward
                        peace.</p>

                            <p>“We must try to get additional muscle behind Ambassador <persName

                                solution because the Middle East not only is inflammatory in its own
                                right in terms of its own territory, but because of many
                                circumstances, including its geographical location, it is an area
                                which could be inflamed depending upon whether the great powers
                                could be engaged or highly involved with each other in a most
                                dangerous fashion. We will continue to work for that just as hard as

                        text of the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>'s comments on the
                        Secretary's seven points on the morning of December 4.<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d337fn2">The text of the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>'s
                            response to the Secretary's seven points was transmitted in telegram
                            4047 from Cairo, December 4. (Ibid., POL 27 ARAB-ISR) In his comments
                            Bergus noted that <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> policy remained
                            focused on the demand for Israeli withdrawal from all occupied Arab
                            territory. (Telegram 4051 from Cairo, December 4; ibid.)</note> He could
                        tell Dr. <persName corresp="#p_GA1">Ghorbal</persName> on a personal <pb
                            n="668" xml:id="pg_668" facs="0696"/>basis that the Department,
                        including the Secretary, had found the response most disappointing. Not only
                        did the Egyptians insist on an irritating and counter-productive rehash of
                        everything since Genesis, but they had not responded in a frank and open
                        manner. In his presentation of November 2, the Secretary had made an
                        important and far-reaching initiative. He had committed us to a position
                        which our friends the Israelis had not liked and which would have entailed
                        considerable difficulty for us in terms of implementation. The Israelis had
                        recently assured us that the Egyptians would get us off the hook by
                        responding negatively. Their forecast had been amply justified by the
                        document we had received that morning. If the Egyptians wanted us to help
                        them, they would have to learn something about dealing with the United
                        States Government. The sort of foggy replies that the Egyptians specialized
                        in only succeeded in irritating people.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_GA1">Ghorbal</persName> said we would have to
                        understand in the first place that the prologue reciting Israeli misdeeds
                        was an essential expression of deep and bitter feeling on the part of the
                        Egyptians. Their territory was occupied. They had a long history of
                        injustice at the hand of Israel and they could not disregard this or set it
                        to one side. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PRB1">Parker</persName> said that on
                        the previous day Dr. <persName corresp="#p_GA1">Ghorbal</persName> had been
                        searching for a word to describe an action which produced a result contrary
                        to that desire. That word was “counter-productive”. This was the term which
                        should be applied to the prologue.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_GA1">Ghorbal</persName> went on to say that the
                        Egyptian response was not really an answer to the seven points, but rather
                        an amplification and a reaffirmation of what <persName corresp="#p_RM1"
                            >Mahmoud Riad</persName> had already said on November 2. As Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA1">Ghorbal</persName> had said earlier,
                            <persName corresp="#p_RM1">Mahmoud Riad</persName> had given his
                        response on November 2. The Americans had chosen not to accept it as
                        definitive. Riad had now reaffirmed it. The Americans kept getting the
                        Egyptians to make concessions while the Israelis made none. Then they
                        proceeded from the new position of the Egyptians and asked them to
                        compromise further instead of asking the Israelis to move. There were some
                        things the Egyptians could accept and others they could not. The US could
                        not, in any event, expect the Egyptians to set forth in a document of this
                        sort, which might fall into the hands of anyone, a position more forthcoming
                        than that given by Riad. It would also have to understand the atmosphere in
                        which this response was drafted. While, on the one hand, the Secretary had
                        been very fair and forthcoming in his statements to Riad, he had also made
                        much of the fact that American leverage with the Israelis was limited. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_PRB1">Parker</persName> had subsequently informed
                        Dr. <persName corresp="#p_GA1">Ghorbal</persName> that the seven points were
                        not a peace plan but were rather a statement of the sort of position we
                        could support. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PRB1">Parker</persName> had also
                        said that we could not guarantee Israel's acceptance. Indeed, the Israelis
                        did not like the seven points. All the while, <persName corresp="#p_EL1"
                            >Eshkol</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DM1">Dayan</persName> were
                        making bellicose statements about the <pb n="669" xml:id="pg_669"
                            facs="0697"/>retention of territory, the consolidation of the Golan
                        Heights and other territories into Israel, on the inevitability of war, etc.
                        We could not expect the Egyptians to put their hands in ours, given these
                        uncertainties.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PRB1">Parker</persName> said that we had made what
                        seemed to us a reasonable offer. We had delineated the position we could
                        support, a position which was not unfavorable to Egypt. If the Egyptians had
                        accepted it wholeheartedly, we would at that moment be working in an effort
                        to get it accepted by the Israelis. The Egyptians were always asking us to
                        put pressure on Israel, but they were not willing to make it possible for us
                        to use what leverage we had.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_GA1">Ghorbal</persName> and Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_PRB1">Parker</persName> proceeded to examine the Egyptian
                        reply point by point. With regard to the indivisibility of withdrawal, Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_PRB1">Parker</persName> noted that the Secretary
                        had proposed as an eighth point an understanding that Egypt's acceptance
                        would be with the understanding that the problems of the other Arab states
                        and Israel would be regulated in a satisfactory manner. It was, of course,
                        difficult to visualize any settlement which returned the Golan Heights to
                        Syria given the fact that Syria refused to cooperate with <persName
                            corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> or to accept the November 22
                        Resolution. In these circumstances, did the <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                            >UAR</gloss> response mean that if all other issues were taken care of
                        and the sole remaining issue was Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights,
                        and the Israelis refused to withdraw, the <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                            >UAR</gloss> would not go to settlement? Dr. <persName corresp="#p_GA1"
                            >Ghorbal</persName> said that was correct. Egypt could not settle with
                        Israel as long as Arab territory beyond what Israel already had before June
                        1967 was occupied. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PRB1">Parker</persName>
                        commented that Egypt was likely to forfeit a settlement over this issue.</p>
                    <p>On termination of belligerency, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PRB1"
                            >Parker</persName> noted that the language of the Egyptian response
                        seemed to mean that termination would come <hi rend="italic">after</hi>
                        withdrawal. Was this the intent? Dr. <persName corresp="#p_GA1"
                            >Ghorbal</persName> said he understood the response to mean that
                        termination of belligerency and withdrawal would be simultaneous.</p>
                    <p>As for the navigation issue, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PRB1"
                            >Parker</persName> noted that the response tied free navigation to the
                        resolution as a whole and not just to the refugee issue. This was a better
                        formulation than the earlier Egyptian position.</p>
                    <p>On the question of refugees, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PRB1"
                            >Parker</persName> said the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> response
                        was unclear. The Secretary had made a specific proposal. The <gloss
                            target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> had replied in general terms that it
                        accepted the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolutions on the subject.
                        This was not news, nor was it responsive. Given the fact that both Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> and Salah Gohar had
                        commented to foreign ambassadors that the Secretary's proposal regarding
                        refugees was unacceptable, we suspected this response was a rejection. Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA1">Ghorbal</persName> said he did not think this
                        was the case. He believed that the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> was
                        at the moment consulting with Palestinian leaders as to what they could
                        accept. Until <pb n="670" xml:id="pg_670" facs="0698"/>those consultations
                        were finished, the Egyptians could not commit themselves to any detailed
                        understanding on the issue. We should interpret the present response as
                        keeping the door open and meaning that the <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                            >UAR</gloss> did not reject the Secretary's proposal, which after all,
                        was not contrary to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolutions.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PRB1">Parker</persName> noted that the <gloss
                            target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> rejected a permanent <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                            >UN</gloss> presence at Sharm Ash-Shaikh. We could not expect the
                        Israelis to settle for less, if indeed they would accept even that. The idea
                        that the Israelis would accept a temporary <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                        presence which the Egyptians could recall when they felt like it, as they
                        had done in 1967, was unrealistic. Both we and the Israelis had to have
                        reassurances that the Straits would be kept open and neither of us trusted
                        the Egyptian word in this regard, given past history. Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_GA1">Ghorbal</persName> said that we should stretch our
                        imaginations on this problem. What we wanted was freedom of navigation, not
                        a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> presence. In a climate of peace, a
                        satisfactory arrangement should be possible. Egypt, however, could not
                        alienate for eternity a part of its territory, no matter how remote or how
                        unimportant as real estate. We should stop talking about a permanent <gloss
                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> presence and start thinking about some
                        arrangement which would give satisfactory assurances to both sides without
                        derogating from Egyptian sovereignty. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PRB1"
                            >Parker</persName> suggested that if the Egyptians had any ideas in this
                        regard they should bring them forward.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PRB1">Parker</persName> noted that the <gloss
                            target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> also rejected the concept of signature of
                        the same document. This presumably was because Egypt rejected sulh
                        (reconciliation), in accordance with the Khartoum formula, although it was
                        now talking of peace (silm), at our urging. Signature of the same document
                        was a symbol of sulh, just as the handshake was a symbol of reconciliation
                        in any ceremonial sulh. The Egyptians should realize that without sulh there
                        would be no silm. If the Egyptians wanted to get the Israelis out of their
                        territory, they had better start thinking about sulh.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_GA1">Ghorbal</persName> said that we should be
                        ingenious enough to find a way to get around the question of signature. The
                        Arabs simply could not sign the same document with Israel. They could,
                        however, sign identical documents on the same day, both of which could be
                        registered immediately with the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and
                        published simultaneously side by side, both committing the two parties to
                        the same things and having the binding force of contracts. Signature on the
                        same piece of paper should not be blown up into an obstacle to agreement.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PRB1">Parker</persName> commented that it was this
                        very inability of the Arabs to sign that same piece of paper which convinced
                        the Israelis that the Arabs were not prepared to offer meaningful peace.</p>

                    <p>Before he left this morning, <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt</persName>
                        asked me to send you our latest reading on the Israel-Jordan fighting
                        today.</p>
                    <p>The Israelis say their Sunday commando attack in southern Jordan was a direct
                        response to terrorist shelling of Israel's Dead Sea phosphate works, but
                        that may only have been the last straw following the Jerusalem bomb
                        explosion last week.</p>
                    <p>Today's attack, however, was directed mainly at the Iraqi troops who have
                        been supporting the terrorists logistically and who themselves opened fire
                        for the first time on Israeli settlements in the Jordan Valley last night.
                        The Israeli embassy here says Israel just couldn't sit still any longer
                        without encouraging more such attacks.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> has asked Wally Barbour to
                        transmit a message from <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName> to the
                        Jordanian government, saying that the Iraqis were the target and that Israel
                        had no intention of widening the action.<note n="3" xml:id="d338fn3">This

                        the same.</p>
                    <p>This will probably delay Jordan-Israel talks. Even the Israelis who are
                        concerned about that argue that they have no choice if they're just not
                        going to roll over in front of the terrorists. But with <persName

                        area-he saw <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> Monday and goes next
                        to Cairo-the Arabs can't help but assume the Israelis don't care. It's clear
                        that they put short-term security above all.</p>

                    <p>During a conversation primarily on other subjects, Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_HPT1">Hart</persName> referred to recent press reports that
                        Israel planned to establish new settlements on the Syrian Golan Heights,
                        allegedly to accommodate some 15,000 settlers. Such reports could only be
                        interpreted as pre-judging the question of sovereignty over areas presently
                        occupied by Israel, and we therefore trusted that these reports were
                        erroneous.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> said that, when
                        Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> had set
                        forth the US position on Israeli withdrawal, he had not mentioned <pb
                            n="673" xml:id="pg_673" facs="0701"/>the Golan Heights. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_HPT1">Hart</persName> replied that we were talking about the
                        principle of the non-acquisition of territory wherever it might be.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> noted that Israel
                        had already established Nahals, which he described as military-agricultural
                        settlements, on the Golan Heights and asked why we were raising this
                        question now. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HPT1">Hart</persName> said that
                        reports of new settlements carried implications of a permanent Israeli
                        presence which was inconsistent with efforts to make progress toward
                        peace.</p>
                    <p>In response to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName>'s
                        comment that this issue could be tested in negotiations if the Syrians would
                        negotiate, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HPT1">Hart</persName> said that he
                        inferred from the Ambassador's comment that the future of the Golan Heights
                        was negotiable. <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> replied that
                        the Government of Israel had made clear everything was negotiable except
                        Jerusalem. He could not say, however, what Israel's position with respect to
                        the Golan Heights would be. Meanwhile he saw no reason why Israel should not
                        do what it wished to fulfill its responsibility for maintaining the
                        territories under its control so long as Israel acted within the context of
                        military occupation and abided by the Geneva Conventions.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HPT1">Hart</persName> said we saw a difference
                        between Israel's utilizing the resources of occupied areas on the one hand
                        and establishing permanent settlements on the other. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DRP1">Davies</persName> added that reports of permanent
                        settlements tended to confirm Arab suspicions that Israel did not intend to
                        withdraw; this could make the Arabs less willing to cooperate with
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>. Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> disagreed, saying that in
                        his view the Arabs would be more eager to negotiate the more they saw a
                        danger that they would not get their territories back.</p>

                    <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> said he would report
                        foregoing promptly. At same time he wanted to explain how <gloss
                            target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> views situation. Israel had accepted cease
                        fire on assumption that it would be mutually respected. By entering
                        agreement with Fedayeen organizations November 16, <gloss target="#t_GOJ1"
                            >GOJ</gloss> had assumed responsibility for Fedayeen activities.
                        According Israeli information, <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss>
                        understanding with Fedayeen groups provides inter alia that latters'
                        operations against Israel would be coordinated with <gloss target="#t_GOJ1"
                            >GOJ</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> continued that Iraqis were
                        in Jordan in division strength consisting of three brigades and had
                        artillery units positioned in northern sector. Israel had evidence that
                        Iraqis had initiated shelling of Israeli settlements December 2 along 25
                        mile front from Tel Qazir to Beisan Valley. This had been preceded by more
                        limited shelling of settlements December 1, to which Israel had responded in
                        limited fashion with 15 artillery rounds against Irbid plus shelling of
                        known Fedayeen concentrations. Following further artillery bombardment of
                        Israeli settlements December 2, Israel had used aircraft against Iraqi
                        positions near Irbid and subsequently against Iraqi positions and other
                        installations on larger scale December 4. <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1"
                            >Rabin</persName> stressed that <gloss target="#t_IDF1">IDF</gloss> had
                        sought to concentrate latest strike only on Iraqi military targets; neither
                        town of Mafraq nor Jordanian airfield had been attacked and there were no
                        overflights of Amman. Israeli Air Force had ignored two Jordanian Hawker
                        Hunters which had been in area at time but had not attempted to engage
                        Israeli planes.</p>
                    <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> added that as Israeli
                        success in stopping terrorist infiltration had grown (he claimed 85-90 per
                        cent of infiltrators now killed or captured), Fedayeen as well as Jordanian
                        and Iraqi military had resorted increasingly to cross river shelling. As
                        result latest Israeli action he thought Iraqis would think twice before
                        provoking further incidents. Neither side wanted major hostilities and he
                        did not believe situation would get out of hand as we feared. Israel could
                        not tolerate shelling <pb n="675" xml:id="pg_675" facs="0703"/>of civilian
                        settlements, however, and unless cease fire was observed by Jordanians,
                        Iraqis and Fedayeen there would be further incidents. Israel wanted to avoid
                        “too much" escalation. Experience had shown, however, that use of “more than
                        normal force" could calm situation for a time.</p>
                    <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> noted that, while Israel had
                        never requested <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> observers on cease fire
                        line with Jordan, it was <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> not Israel
                        which had refused to accept them. In response to query whether Israel would
                        accept observers if Jordan agreed, <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1"
                            >Rabin</persName> said <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> had never

                            <gloss target="#t_SARG1">SARG</gloss> had done so.</p>

                            277</ref>.</note> As you will recall, the occasion for the President's
                        message was our announcement to open negotiations for the sale of Phantom
                        jet aircraft to Israel. The message was designed to reassure the King that
                        these negotiations in no way prejudiced USG support for the <persName
                            corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> Mission or for Jordan.</p>
                    <pb n="676" xml:id="pg_676" facs="0704"/>
                    <p>The King is obviously very upset with the proposed sale of Phantoms to
                        Israel. His sharply worded reply to the President reflects the great strains
                        placed upon him during the past months. A principal thrust of the King's
                        reply is that alleged Israeli intransigence and alleged United States'
                        passivity in the face of this intransigence impedes a peaceful settlement in
                        the Middle East. Other points made by the King include: (1) the proposed
                        Phantom sale directly contradicts our profession of support for the
                            <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> Mission; (2) Jordan has
                        suffered from Israeli military actions since the June 1967 war, particularly
                        from aircraft supplied to Israel by the United States; (3) Jordan's marked
                        military inferiority to Israel requires a military quid pro quo for Jordan
                        to offset the Phantoms; (4) the United States' commitment to the territorial
                        integrity of Jordan continues to be violated by Israeli occupation; (5) U.S.
                        actions and positions on the Middle East problem are making it difficult for
                            <persName>Hussein</persName> and other moderate Arabs to justify their
                        close ties with the United States.</p>
                    <p>Our Ambassador in Jordan has a continuing dialogue with the King and there is
                        no need for a further response on the part of the President. A signed copy
                        of the letter has been sent by pouch.</p>

                    <p>Governor Scranton asked Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_YA1">Abdullah
                            Yafi</persName> for his views on the Middle East situation. <persName
                            corresp="#p_YA1">Yafi</persName> went into a detailed expose of the
                        history of the Arab-Israeli crisis from 1948. He characterized Israel as a
                        racist, expansionist and aggressive state in the heart of the Arab homeland.
                            <persName corresp="#p_YA1">Yafi</persName> emphasized that the Arabs
                        were in a state of legitimate self defense. From 1948 on, he said, the Arabs
                        have been the victims of aggression on three separate occasions.</p>
                    <p>Governor Scranton inquired what form any future peaceful settlement might
                        take. Would it be based, for example, on demarcation lines readily agreed to
                        by both sides and Arab recognition of Israel? Prime Minister <persName
                            corresp="#p_YA1">Yafi</persName> replied that the question of Arab
                        recognition of the state of Israel was absolutely impossible for many
                        reasons, to include the radical political pressures emanating from Arab
                        youth today. <persName corresp="#p_YA1">Yafi</persName> characterized the
                        views of the new Arab generation on the question of Palestine as being more
                        fanatic than the views shared by the present Arab leadership. Insofar as
                        demarcation lines were concerned, they could be agreed upon as long as
                        Israel was not given any bonuses (in territorial terms) for her acts of
                        aggression.</p>
                    <p>Governor Scranton asked the Prime Minister for his views on the <persName
                            corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> Mission and whether or not <persName
                            corresp="#p_YA1">Yafi</persName> thought there was any better
                        alternative for reaching a peaceful settlement. Governor Scranton commented
                        that President-elect <persName>Richard Nixon</persName> was very much
                        interested in the Middle East situation and he was fully aware of the
                        expectations surrounding his advent to the American presidency. The Governor
                            <pb n="678" xml:id="pg_678" facs="0706"/>wondered whether or not the
                        Arabs were waiting to see what the Nixon Administration would do before they
                        went any further on the <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>
                        Mission. <persName corresp="#p_YA1">Yafi</persName> said the Arabs have
                        placed much hope in the New American Administration. Concerning a
                        settlement, he said he sees no other means than the <persName
                            corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> Mission and the November 22, 1967
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Resolution as the basis of a peaceful
                        settlement. He strongly supported execution of the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                            >UN</gloss> Resolution, and said the Arabs had accepted the resolution
                        in full but that the Israelis had considered it as sort of a “battle order"
                        which they treated in a routine manner. What was needed was to carry out the
                        principles of the resolution and establish a timetable.</p>

                            >Yafi</persName> exactly what he meant by a timetable. <persName
                            corresp="#p_YA1">Yafi</persName> said before any timetable could be
                        established, Israel would have to accept the resolution as a whole. This
                        would lead to specific stages of execution, to include, in part: Israeli
                        withdrawal from the Occupied Territories; freedom of navigation for Israeli
                        vessels through the Suez Canal; arrangements for the return of the
                        Palestinian refugees either to their former homes in Israel or to other
                        parts of the Arab world, etc.</p>
                    <p>Governor Scranton asked the Prime Minister exactly how any settlement, within
                        the framework of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Resolution would be
                        executed. Would it mean the establishment of demilitarized zones and the
                        installation of an international police force, for example?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_YA1">Yafi</persName> said he did not agree with the
                        establishment of an international police force along the Arab-Israeli
                        border. He stated the presence of such an international force has not and
                        would not, in the future, deter any further aggression, which, he claimed,
                        would come only from the Israeli side. However, he stressed that the United
                        Nations should be used as the instrument for enforcing any settlement, and
                        that the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> must, with this objective in
                        mind, be “reinforced" by the Great Powers in order that it may play an
                        active and productive role in maintaining peace in the area.</p>
                    <p>Governor Scranton commented that Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_YA1"
                            >Yafi</persName>'s frank remarks about the impossibility of the Arabs
                        living with the State of Israel led him to ask whether the Arabs would ever
                        accept the very existence of the state of Israel, and consequently, if there
                        was any real hope for peace. Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_YA1"
                            >Yafi</persName> replied that what the Arabs were opposed to was the
                        racist, expansionist, zionist state of Israel which could not be tolerated.
                        Governor Scranton said if this was the case, and the Arabs were not bent on
                        the extinction of the state of Israel, then there would be some hope for a
                        real settlement. He stated the United States had been opposed to Israeli
                        expansionism and that this was also the position of President-elect Nixon.
                        To limit Israeli expansion would, however, require some assurances from Arab
                        states as well. <persName corresp="#p_YA1">Yafi</persName> stated that there
                        could be no definitive peace between the Arabs and Israelis, <pb n="679"
                            xml:id="pg_679" facs="0707"/>and that, frankly speaking, only a
                        comprehensive “truce" could be concluded between the two sides because the
                        major issues dividing them were irreconcilable.</p>
                    <p>Governor Scranton said most Americans support the existence of the state of
                        Israel, but also that most Americans were opposed to Israeli expansionism at
                        the expense of the Arab states. However, the Governor continued, most
                        Americans also believe that the Arab position is the elimination of the
                        state of Israel. Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_YA1">Yafi</persName>
                        explained that this was not the case and that what the Arabs were opposed to
                        was Israel aggression and expansionism.</p>
                    <p>In the long term, <persName corresp="#p_YA1">Yafi</persName> stated, the
                        Israelis will not be able to maintain their present policies and remain in
                        the Arab world. If history is any proof, Israel's destiny will not be unlike
                        that of other foreign entities which implanted themselves on the Arab world
                        like the Crusader Kingdoms and the French and British mandates. These
                        entities, <persName corresp="#p_YA1">Yafi</persName> said, were unable to
                        maintain their positions in the Middle East on any permanent basis.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_YA1">Yafi</persName> made it clear that in his opinion
                        the US should not pressure the Arab states to go further than implementation
                        of the November 22 <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Resolution. He said any
                        pressures in this regard would be unproductive.</p>
                    <p>Governor Scranton remarked that one thing which concerned him was the
                        exaggerated expectations on the part of the Arabs that if the US exerts
                        enough pressure over Israel, Israel will do whatever the US wants. Scranton
                        said this is definitely not the case. However, he added, US pressure would
                        seem to be necessary to contain Israeli expansionism. In any case, he
                        emphasized, there are limits to US influence over Israel. <persName
                            corresp="#p_YA1">Yafi</persName> said that he understood this very well
                        but, unfortunately, the Arab masses believe otherwise. In conclusion, Prime
                        Minister <persName corresp="#p_YA1">Yafi</persName> told Governor Scranton
                        that what the Arabs were asking for is positive pressure from the US and
                        not, what he termed, negative pressure.</p>
                    <p>As examples of such “negative pressure”, he referred to the US-Israeli
                        Phantom jet sale negotiations and US abstention on the <gloss
                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Resolution on Jerusalem. <persName
                            corresp="#p_YA1">Yafi</persName> said it was unfortunate that the US
                        adopted these positions while Israel was defying international public
                        opinion and <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolutions by continuing her
                        occupation of Arab territories. For these reasons, he repeated, the Arabs
                        considered themselves to be in a state of legitimate self defense.</p>

                                >Mahmoud Riad</persName> on the morning of December 6 was reported
                            in telegram 4079 from Cairo, December 7. (Ibid.)</note> Scranton found
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> completely relaxed. At no
                        time did he become emotional. Following is brief sketch of highlights:</p>
                    <p>2. US-<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> Relations. <persName
                            corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> said he had been thinking of writing
                        letter to President-elect Nixon and sending it via former Treasury Secretary
                        Anderson. Then Scranton visit had been proposed and <persName
                            corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> thought it might be better convey
                        views orally via Scranton. Governor said he believed it would still be good
                        idea for <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> to write
                        President-elect.</p>
                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> several times said he would
                        like see resumption diplomatic relations. He would like have a clear
                        assertion of US policy on which he could hang it. He believed that if <gloss
                            target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> resumed relations, other Arab states would
                        follow. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> said he had been ready
                        resume relations last February but US behavior in Security Council had
                        caused him change his mind.</p>
                    <p>4. Governor suggested desirability of <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                            >Nasser</persName>'s making some kind of overture to US. This would help
                        with American public opinion which still to large extent dwelt on false
                        accusation that US had participated militarily in June war. Moreover,
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> gesture towards US would
                        strengthen hand of new administration in influencing Israelis to take steps
                        towards peace. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> did not argue
                        this point.</p>
                    <p>5. Sharm-al-Sheikh. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> said that
                        during May-June 1967 crisis he discovered he did not have military power
                        physically to close Straits Tiran. Governor pointed out that with subsequent
                        rebuilding of <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> armed forces, they
                        probably had acquired this capability. Governor said this emphasized need
                        for <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> presence at Sharm-al-Sheikh. No
                        argument from <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>.</p>
                    <p>6. Sinai. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> said Sinai, while
                        important, was less important than problems of West Bank of Jordan and
                        refugees.</p>
                    <p>7. Refugees. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> felt back of
                        refugee problem could be broken if 500,000 refugees (both '48 and '67) could
                        be settled on West Bank of <pb n="681" xml:id="pg_681" facs="0709"/>Jordan.
                        He wondered how water could be provided for such resettlement.</p>
                    <p>8. Gaza. While <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> didn't want it
                        ceded to Israel, he indicated no problem in finding workable solution.</p>
                    <p>9. Demilitarized Zones. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
                        reiterated Riad's dislike of idea of demilitarizing entire Sinai on grounds
                        this would give undue military advantage to Israel. He also said <gloss
                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> forces in Sinai would not fight if Israel
                        invaded.</p>
                    <p>10. Suez Canal. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> implied there
                        no problem re opening of Canal to flags of all nations.</p>
                    <p>11. Peace. Governor gained impression <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                            >Nasser</persName> had yearning for Arab-Israel settlement so he could
                        concentrate on internal situation.</p>
                    <p>12. Internal Problems. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> said
                        both Egyptian youth and military wanted revenge against Israel. He said his
                        own children called for revenge. He stated that many Egyptian youth were
                        volunteering to join Fedayeen.</p>
                    <p>13. <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                            >Nasser</persName> made usual statements to effect <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> did not control <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                            >UAR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>14. Syria. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> felt that if overall
                        Arab-Israel settlement came in sight, he believed he could handle Syrians.
                        He spoke specifically in terms of a settlement which would not necessarily
                        involve return of Syrians to Golan Heights.</p>
                    <p>15. Iraq. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> said recent Israel
                        raids on Iraq forces in Jordan had solidified Iraqis behind their
                        government. He noted riots in Baghdad had ceased.</p>
                    <p>16. Communist China. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> said
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> did not have good relations with
                        ChiComs.</p>

                        <item>Governor Scranton said that King presented his points calmly and
                            dispassionately throughout talk. While revealing disappointment with US
                            actions, or lack of actions, did not punctuate his criticism with sharp
                            or bitter comments. He was “very pleasant.” (<persName corresp="#p_RZ1"

                        <item>Much of conversation dealt with terms of possible settlement (Amman
                                7822).<note n="2" xml:id="d344fn2">Telegram 7822 from Amman,
                                December 9, provided an account of Governor Scranton's discussion
                                with King Hussein on the informal exchanges between Jordan and
                                Israel. King Hussein indicated that as a result of the exchanges he
                                had become convinced that Israel was not serious about negotiating a
                                settlement with Jordan. His conclusion was that Israel was
                                determined to annex significant portions of the West Bank and would
                                refuse to leave East Jerusalem. <persName>Hussein</persName> felt
                                that the United States was the only country capable of exerting
                                sufficient pressure to change Israeli policy, but he did not
                                anticipate such a dramatic change in U.S. policy. (Ibid., POL 27-14

                            initial one. <persName corresp="#p_WJR1">Wiggins</persName> said if memo
                            helps <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>, that is good.
                            Certainly early sections of memo (which <persName corresp="#p_KMAE1">El
                                Kony</persName> called historical expose) look backward rather than
                            forward. Perhaps we were expecting too much in a tragic situation which
                            moves so painfully slow. If memo does prove to be helpful element, we
                            will gladly admit our reaction to it was wrong.</item>

                            Riad's explanation seems something like adding apples and pears because

                            <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> began by presenting his whole
                            theory of global conflict. 1967 Arab-Israel war had been a great free
                            world victory and global context was clear setback for Soviet
                            penetration of <gloss target="#t_ME1">ME</gloss>. It was Sov policy to
                            get Sixth Fleet out or to denuclearize <gloss target="#t_ME1"
                            >ME</gloss>. Chief agent of Sovs is <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                                >Nasser</persName>. Since Israel has achieved success and has
                            stopped Sov takeover of <gloss target="#t_ME1">ME</gloss>, US and Israel
                            should join together as espousers of freedom.</item>

                        <item>In <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName>'s opinion <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> understands that US and Israel hope
                            for freedom in area. Because of Israel's successful policy, Sovs have
                            instituted contacts recently and have realized that Israel is a large
                            factor in <gloss target="#t_ME1">ME</gloss> and does not intend to be
                            displaced. It is true that Sovs have strengthened their influence in
                                <gloss target="#t_ME1">ME</gloss>, but only in those places where
                            they were strong before, such as Iraq, Syria, Yemen, <gloss
                                target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, Sudan. Sovs would like to make
                            Mediterranean a Soviet lake.</item>

                        <item>Scranton asked whether <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName>
                            didn't agree position of Jordan and Saudi Arabia was weaker than before.
                            Didn't they have more internal troubles on which Soviets could
                            capitalize?</item>

                            <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> said in his opinion US was
                            dominant power in <gloss target="#t_ME1">ME</gloss> and all eyes were on
                            Washington. Suez Canal was our big card and we should play it for peace
                            and not wish for necessity to reopen Canal in absence of peace. US
                            should depend on and help continue Israel's association with Iran and
                            Ethiopia. If ever there was a clear exposition of <persName

                            was Dulles' written statement to Israel re <gloss target="#t_UAR1"

                            <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName>'s next theme was how to get
                            peace. This should be done between Israel and Jordan first. Israel and
                                <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> strongly anti-<persName
                                corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>; <persName>Hussein</persName>
                            more reasonable. Israel's two important principles were to “go forward"
                            to secure and permanent boundaries that are recognized. There must be an
                            agreed solution (“and US says this too”) and not one imposed from
                            outside. In short, nature of peace most important. There <pb n="686"
                                xml:id="pg_686" facs="0714"/>must be an end to blockades, raids,
                            etc. though not necessarily exchange of ambassadors. In short,
                            settlement must be in terms of international law and order.</item>

                            <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> continued Israel was opposed
                            to external guarantees. These never worked. Israel had had deepest
                            commitment from France but this had not worked. Agreement must come from
                            countries themselves. In <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName>'s
                            opinion, <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s objective was
                            to get territory back without peace or if this was not possible, wait
                            until he was in position to go to war again.</item>

                            said, <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> did not wish to
                            allow Gulf of Aqaba to be international waterway. He had been completely
                            unresponsive to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s
                            seven points. Scranton pointed out this somewhat exaggerated and
                            response not completely negative.</item>

                            <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> thought Egypt represented
                            greatest rigidity. Sovs however not so rigid now. They had recently come
                            to Israel, which is victory for Israel's stand on strength and
                            determination not to withdraw without real peace.</item>

                            <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> said Jordan was not thinking
                            of another war. <persName>Hussein</persName> needs to settle soon or
                            there will be an internal collapse because of Palestinian problems. He
                            could make peace without Cairo's assent, <persName>Hussein</persName>
                            tells Israel, but he needs a peace good enough from his point of view as
                            not to cause internal problems with Palestinians. Israel's proposals re
                            West Bank were that no Arab army should be west of Jordan River. Jordan
                            would get back 90 percent of population and 85 percent of territory on
                            West Bank. Only 17,000 Arabs would be left in the territory which Israel
                            required. Re Jerusalem, it must remain united and capital of Israel.
                            Good progress had been made with Vatican re Christian Holy Places and
                            Israel would be glad to give sovereignty (sic) over Christian Holy
                            Places to appropriate bodies. Any agreed sovereign (sic) for Moslem Holy
                            Places would be agreeable to Israel but Jordan was nearest and second
                            obvious choice.</item>

                        <item>Asked by Scranton about talks which had gone on with Palestinians

                            optimistic. Did not like idea of buffer state. Most Palestinians wish to
                            be with whoever is in charge of East Bank. Inference was that any such

                    <p>6853. 1. <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> said he assumed the
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Secretariat has informed Department of
                        his reports of his recent round of consultations. He did give me in writing
                        the following excerpt from the paper the Israelis had given him for Jordan
                        which he said contained the gist of the document: “Having accepted
                        Resolution 242 for the establishment of a just and lasting peace, we are
                        ready to enter into discussions with Jordan under your auspices in an effort
                        to achieve mutual agreement on ways <pb n="691" xml:id="pg_691" facs="0719"
                        />to implement it. The resolution, being not self-executing, should be
                        subject for discussion and agreement between the parties. This is a
                        legitimate and affirmative formulation, fully consistent with international
                        law and national rights. The essence of our position is that only things
                        that are agreed can be implemented. This is the purpose and intention of
                        Chapter 6 of the Charter as well as of the resolution itself as expressed in
                        paragraph 3, para. on the boundary question. Israel's position is that
                        within the framework of peace, the cease-fire lines will be replaced by
                        agreed, secure and recognized boundaries and the adequate disposition of
                        forces will be carried out in full accordance with what is agreed between
                        the parties. These boundary and security questions are open for negotiation
                        in the context of a transition to a permanent peace which should have treaty
                        form.”</p>
                    <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> said the Arabs at first read
                        the word “replaced" to mean that Israelis would keep all territory they now
                        hold. He assured them this not the case which Israelis confirmed to him. He
                        did not think the document had advanced matters at all.</p>
                    <p>3. He also said that the exchanges through him between <gloss
                            target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and Israel while very long had in effect
                        merely said the same old things.</p>
                    <p>4. On Secretary's seven points Riad told <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                            >Jarring</persName> that the leak in Paris had been unfortunate and had
                        forced him to make his own position clear. Riad said he would reply in
                        writing as requested but pointed out that in written document he would have
                        to be more careful than he could be in an oral discussion. He cited Sharm el
                        Shaikh as an example saying his reply would have to say that <gloss
                            target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> could not accept a <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                            >UN</gloss> force there for an unlimited time. He would also demand
                        similar arrangement for El Auja. In conversation with <persName
                            corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>, however, Riad indicated that a
                        fixed period of time for <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> occupation of
                        Sharm el Shaikh could be acceptable and under <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                            >Jarring</persName>'s prodding indicated this might be for as long as 15
                        years. For the present I gathered he was not willing that the Israelis be
                        informed of this.</p>
                    <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> thinks both Arabs and Israel
                        will wait advent of new American administration before making any further
                        moves. He thought Governor Scranton's visit had been very useful.</p>
                    <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> was impressed with Sapir who
                        he thought saw the problem realistically. <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                            >Jarring</persName> is worried about the escalation between Israel and
                        Jordan and the Israeli policy of four eyes for one.</p>
                    <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> met yesterday with Semenov
                        and Kuznetsov who were interested in his report but appeared disinclined to
                        discuss matters of substance. <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>
                        continues to think however that Soviets desire a solution and are pressing
                        the Arabs.</p>
                    <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> did not think Soviets and
                        Israelis were likely to reestablish relations soon. He said Israelis had
                        repeatedly warned him that if he put forward his own plan his mission was
                        finished. <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> is thinking <pb
                            n="692" xml:id="pg_692" facs="0720"/>of sending a cable to the parties
                        about January 10 proposing further talks but has not yet decided on where he
                        would propose they be held.</p>
                    <p>9. My impression is that <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>
                        realizes patience is required and will give it another good try but will not
                        go on indefinitely if no progress is made.</p>

                            Cairo, December 14, Bergus noted that President-elect Nixon indicated
                            that he was prepared to receive the Amir of Kuwait and Israeli Defense
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_DM1">Dayan</persName> prior to the
                            inauguration. This was contrary to the earlier position taken by Nixon
                            that he would receive no foreign dignitaries before the inauguration.
                            Bergus suggested that Nixon should express a willingness to receive an

                            was temporary suspension of rules. All previous requests for meetings
                            were turned down, including Iranian request that Mr.
                                <persName>Nixon</persName> receive Prime Minister Hoveyda. Exception
                            was made in case of Amir and <persName corresp="#p_DM1">Dayan</persName>
                            for various reasons, but we are informed that rule has now been

                        the moment in terms of a large 100-150 million-gallon-per-day (MGD) desalter
                        and concentrate on a 40 MGD plant. He fully shares your goal of becoming
                        able over the next 10-15 years to desalt seawater on a large scale, and he
                        believes we should push ahead with this plant “as a matter of priority.” He
                        has two main reasons for recommending a smaller plant than we initially
                        considered: <list>

                                technology of large-scale desalting would be to build a 40 MGD
                                plant. This would be enough larger (more than 5 times) than present
                                plants to provide an important test of new technology at reasonable
                                cost (about $58 million). We would gain almost as much in
                                technological knowledge as we would from the $100 million plus that

                    <p>To simplify our financial problem, George believes we should concentrate on
                        desalting and get away from the idea of financing an Israeli electric power
                        plant as part of a dual purpose water and power plant. The Israelis will be
                        building new power plants right along to meet increasing demand for
                        electricity. He doesn't see why they shouldn't provide the steam from one of
                        these power plants as part of their contribution while we concentrate on the
                        desalter to turn that steam into water.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, George proposes we take the necessary steps to get Congressional
                        authorization for Interior to spend up to $40 million on this plant. In
                        addition to the steam from the power plant, Israel would provide $18 million
                        using a loan from the World Bank or some other such loan agency. While the
                        cost of water would still be very high, George believes the total Israeli
                        contribution would not exceed the actual value of the water to Israel. Since
                        the power plant would cost around $20 million, this would add up roughly to
                        a 50-50 split between us.</p>

                            <item>—George's strong words about “abandoning" or “holding in abeyance"
                                the plan for a big dual purpose plant. They believe it is important
                                to preserve the idea that this is just the first step toward a later
                                expansion into a larger plant. Secretary Udall goes along with
                                presenting this to the Congress as Phase I of a larger project, but
                                he would say that Israel must fund later expansion by itself. George
                                says he didn't mean to close any doors—just to re-focus for a
                                moment.</item>
                            <item>—George's unwillingness to insist that the plant use nuclear fuel.
                                His investigations persuade him that there's no economic advantage
                                to nuclear over fossil fuel and that, if we ask the Israelis to
                                provide the steam-producing plant, the choice of fuel ought to be
                                theirs. <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> believes we have a
                                strong interest in nuclear desalting. <gloss target="#t_AEC1"
                                    >AEC</gloss> further feels we should keep our strings on that
                                Israeli decision to be sure they buy US nuclear equipment with
                                safeguards. <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> believes it could
                                justify a contribution of $10-15 million to the power (not
                                desalting) plant if it were nuclear, and if our own California plant
                                doesn't go ahead. Secretary Udall believes we should leave the
                                choice of fuel open. (The Israelis, <pb n="695" xml:id="pg_695"
                                    facs="0723"/>like the rest of us, would like to leave the choice

                            <item>—George's judgment that it's “not possible at this time to obtain

                                “extensive Congressional support" for a big nuclear desalting plant
                                because of the sympathetic attitude of the Joint Committee on Atomic
                                Energy which would review the proposal along with the two Interior
                                Committees. George's proposal for an Interior contribution would
                                only go before the two Interior Committees which would be less
                                cordial.</item>
                        </list>
                    </p>
                    <p>On this last point, Secretary Udall thinks the Senate Interior Committee
                        would be receptive but is less sure about the House. However, he points out
                        that the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1970 expenditure would be only $5
                        million and remaining costs would be spread over five years. Only about $1
                        million of the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1970 figure would be needed
                        for Israeli planning. The rest would go for testing some promising new
                        technology which should go into the Israeli plant. Interior should proceed
                        with this testing in any case, and that would cost about $4 million. <gloss
                            target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> feels Congress might see even $40 million
                        as “just another aid spigot" and thinks Israel should foot even more of the
                        bill than George recommends. State recommends that we pick up about $30
                        million of the $40 million, leaving the rest to Israel.</p>
                    <p>In searching for a reasonable compromise, I would stand with George in saying
                        that the fuel is an Israeli decision, but I would be a little less emphatic
                        in “abandoning" the goal of a larger plant. I don't believe we are ready to
                        commit ourselves yet, but I don't see why we shouldn't be quite honest in
                        saying we're neither opening nor closing that door at this stage.</p>
                    <p>We asked both Don Hornig and Charlie Zwick to look at this package: <list>
                            <item>—Don feels that desalting technology has reached a stage where
                                it's time to test a prototype of a large plant. He believes the 40
                                MGD size George proposes is reasonable. Given the apparently
                                indefinite delay in building the large plant in California, he
                                thinks it's sensible to try the experiment in Israel. He accepts
                                George's recommendation that we concentrate on the desalter and let
                                Israel provide the power plant to produce the necessary steam. He
                                does not believe we should commit ourselves to future expansion of
                                the Israeli project.</item>
                            <item>—Charlie suggests that you let this decision ride. He questions
                                the need to spend tight resources on a large experimental plant
                                where the economic benefits are uncertain, especially when we are
                                straining to keep your budget down. If a large desalting
                                demonstration is to be undertaken, he would prefer that it be done
                                in the US where technological <pb n="696" xml:id="pg_696"
                                    facs="0724"/>access to the plant is assured over time. He
                                specifically questions the Israeli site in view of the risk of
                                building and operating the plant in a war zone. He feels that <gloss
                                    target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> funds should not be used to put
                                    <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> in the “foreign aid"
                                business on the scale contemplated by <gloss target="#t_AEC1"

                    </p>
                    <p>For these reasons, Charlie feels that if we go ahead with the Israeli project
                        the contribution be limited to $30 million, and like foreign aid, we should
                        require that procurement, construction, and operation contracts be limited
                        to US sources. Charlie agrees with Don that we should not commit ourselves
                        to future expansion of the Israeli project. Charlie also agrees with
                            <persName corresp="#p_WG1">Woods</persName> that we would get as much
                        technology out of the 40 MGD plant as out of the big dual-purpose-plant-and
                        at substantially less cost.</p>

                        proposal is quite reasonable, and he would be prepared to discuss details of
                        how to proceed. Herzog felt it would be helpful if you were to include this

                                    and (b) in a program which you launched with Israel in 1964. The
                                    disadvantage is that the Congress may well disregard this

                                    contribution. This would be about a 50-50 split between us. The
                                    argument for $30 million is that Israel too will profit in
                                    future plants from the results of the research and should
                                    contribute to the desalter too.</p>

                        with a plant like this soon. However, I recognize that there are still
                        political questions to be considered and that we would probably not wish to
                        begin construction if another war seemed likely. But these are questions for
                        the next Administration. The main issue is whether you wish to propose this
                        first step now or leave the issue entirely to the next team.</p>

                        <item>Here in Amman we have a definite feeling of having arrived at an
                            impasse in efforts to reach an Arab-Israel settlement. We have reported
                            the gloomy attitudes of senior Jordanians caused by the hiatus in
                                <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>'s activities and their
                            increasing stress on the need for building up a stronger defensive
                            military posture in order to deal effectively with Israel. Several of my
                            diplomatic colleagues with good connections to the Palace and Prime
                            Ministry share my own observations of the current purposeless drift in
                            Jordanian policy—with its overtones of pessimism. The piece of paper
                            handed to Governor Scranton by King Hussein (Amman 7822)<note n="2"

                                <persName>Hussein</persName>'s own conclusion that Jordanian
                            contacts with Israel, both direct and indirect, have failed to produce
                            progress towards a peaceful settlement. The King emphasized he could do
                            no more. In effect, the Jordanians are now leaving the initiative to
                            others.</item>

                        <item>My own reading of the present situation is that the Jordanians (with
                            strong behind-the-scenes support from the <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                                >UAR</gloss> and other Arabs) are also clearly putting a challenge
                            to the US, and particularly to the new administration. In many ways it
                            is an unrealistic challenge and their expectations for policy changes
                            and new initiatives certainly exceed the possibilities. Nevertheless,
                            the seeming impasse coupled with this Arab challenge and expectation
                            require us in our own interest to develop revised tactics.</item>

                                    1967 conflict, the Arabs in recent months have become less,
                                    rather than more, willing to compromise on the acceptance of
                                    Israel as a state with which they will entertain normal
                                    international relations. (In many ways the Arabs do not have

                                    Israeli security concerns in terms of acquisition of territory.
                                    The Israelis seem unable to grasp that the <persName

                                    demonstrated they are more likely to breed subsequent trouble

                                    internal situation place very decided constraints on the

                                    sees our assurances as his final, fallback position. We must
                                    accept this fact ourselves and continue to make it clear to the
                                    Israelis.</item>

                    <p>Note was taken in Moscow of some recent statements made by American officials
                        in conversations with Soviet representatives in Washington and New York
                        regarding the problems of a Middle East settlement, including observations
                        made by Under Secretary Eugene Rostow, on behalf of the Secretary of State,
                        in the conversation with the Soviet Ambassador on November 8 last. We
                        welcomed the statement by the American side of its interest in continuing
                        Soviet-American contacts and a regular exchange of views on the problems of
                        a Middle East settlement. We, for our part, consider these contacts to be
                        useful and are ready to continue them.</p>
                    <p>American representatives have put forward a number of considerations on the
                        questions related to a settlement in the Middle East. These considerations
                        are of definite interest, and we would like to express our opinion in
                        connection with some of them.</p>

                        <item>The Soviet Government notes with satisfaction the statement by the
                            American side to the effect that Israel is now resting the whole
                            territorial question on the Armistice Agreements of 1949, that is to
                            say, in other words, that it has no territorial claims against the Arab
                            States. It would be highly important that such a clear-cut and
                            unequivocal statement be brought by the Israelis to the attention of
                            Arab representatives as well (for instance, through Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>). Such a statement, in our

                            settlement in the Middle East; it would lead to the development of a new
                            and positive approach to this question.</item>

                        <item>The American side expressed the view that Israel's only territorial

                            concerns the question of guaranteeing freedom of navigation through the
                            Strait of Tiran, since Israel raises the question of the necessity of
                            stationing her forces at Sharm El Sheikh. Such a suggestion reveals once
                            more the lack among the Israeli leaders of a realistic approach towards
                            the problems of a settlement in the Middle East and their unwillingness
                            to take the path of introducing reasonable and constructive proposals
                            capable of advancing the whole question of settlement.</item>

                                    >Eban</persName>'s document of November 4:<note n="2"
                                    xml:id="d354fn2">See <ref target="#d307fn2">footnote 2, Document
                                        307</ref>.</note> that it is essential for the <gloss
                                    target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> to clarify its attitude toward a
                                number of aspects of a settlement in the Middle East; and that the
                                question of boundaries between Israel and the <gloss
                                    target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> could be discussed after the
                                Egyptians have stated their readiness to establish a lasting peace
                                with Israel.</p>
                            <p>As we see it, the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> position is
                                determined not only by the fact of its official recognition of the
                                Security Council resolution of November 22, 1967 and by the
                                statement of the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>'s readiness to
                                implement the provisions of that resolution, but also by the
                                constructive response of the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                                government to the known “seven points,” outlined by Mr. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>. In that answer it is stated:
                                “As to the termination of the state of belligerency, it will come
                                into force on the Arab side as soon as Israel's forces are withdrawn
                                from the entire Arab territory occupied after June 5, 1967.”</p>
                            <p>At the same time, the Arab States have reasons to be dissatisfied
                                with the fact that Israel, so far, has not made a clear and precise
                                statement concerning recognition of this resolution and the
                                readiness to implement it, that is, a statement similar to the
                                corresponding statement by the Arab side.</p>
                            <p>Moreover, the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> is known to have
                                proposed drawing up a timetable for implementing the resolution,
                                that is, for implementing all of its provisions, and has made
                                specific suggestions in that connection. The Secretary of State has
                                already had an opportunity to become acquainted with these
                                suggestions. As for Israel, we know nothing about its attitude, not
                                only toward these specific suggestions but even toward the very idea
                                of drawing up a concrete program of measures to implement the
                                resolution, which could lead to the establishment of peace and
                                tranquillity in the Middle East. The American side, it seems to us,
                                concurs in the necessity of a concrete approach to the questions of
                                settlement. All the more valid, then, is the proposal of the Arab
                                side regarding the necessity of working out a plan of concrete steps
                                for the implementation of the Security Council resolution of
                                November 22, 1967. It would seem proper for the American and Soviet
                                sides to make efforts to assist the sides in working out such a
                                plan. We would like to point out, in this connection, that we had
                                already conveyed to the Secretary of State, on September 4 last, our
                                views on this score.</p>

                        <item>We believe that the so-called seven points, enumerated by the American
                            side, contain some constructive views. In particular, we noted that the
                            first place among them is given to the question of Israel's withdrawal
                            from the Arab territories seized after June 5, 1967. Naturally, the
                            attitude of the Middle Eastern countries to these proposals is of
                            crucial importance. As it is known, the <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                                >UAR</gloss> Government has already replied to these American views.
                            On the whole, the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> leadership
                            regarded the US “seven points" favorably, stipulating that the question
                            can be that of the withdrawal of the Israeli troops from all the
                            occupied Arab territories, i.e., not only from the territory of the
                                <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> but also from those of Jordan
                            and Syria.</item>
                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>As for the proposal made by the American side regarding the
                            demilitarization of the entire Sinai Peninsula, we do not believe that
                            it will be acceptable to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. In
                            view of the incommensurability of the Sinai and the Negev, it would be
                            feasible, in our opinion, to speak only about the possibility of
                            creating separate demilitarized zones along the boundaries in this
                            area.</item>
                        <label>7.</label>
                        <item>Now, as never before, there is a need for clarity and unambiguity in
                            the positions of the sides. One cannot but admit that up to now efforts
                            to obtain such clarity from the Israelis have been unsuccessful. While
                            the Arab side has made a number of concrete and realistic proposals,
                            which largely contributed to the development of some positive changes in
                            the matter of a Middle East settlement, one cannot say this about
                            Israel. Its position continues to be the main obstacle in the way of
                            achieving a settlement in the Middle East.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>Therefore, we hope that the US Government will exercise its influence upon
                        the Israeli Government so that the latter may adopt a more realistic
                        position.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Government expresses its readiness for a further exchange of views
                        with the American side regarding the problems of a settlement in the Middle
                        East.</p>

                        is it.” General Carmon said that the overall package would cost about $300
                        million. Some of this would be on credit with the remainder a “dependable

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SHH2">Schwartz</persName> said he had just learned
                        that Israel had decided to buy 6 RF4C aircraft now and, working with the
                        company, have the engines changed to make it compatible with the F-4Es.
                        General Peled confirmed that this was their decision.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> said there was still
                        one problem: early deliveries. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WPC1"
                            >Warnke</persName> said that we had done our work and sent the facts to
                        the President. He said that the decision rests with the White House.
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> observed that there
                        were two aspects: political and technical. He said the President would of
                        course decide the political. He asked, however, whether Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_WPC1">Warnke</persName> could tell him whether early <pb

                        technical side. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WPC1">Warnke</persName> said
                        anything was possible; it was a question of whether it was desirable.</p>
                    <p>General Peled said that he had talked with everyone he could in the Air Force
                        about how the <gloss target="#t_IAF1">IAF</gloss> would handle early
                        deliveries. He complained that the <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss>
                        people would not engage him in a discussion—they just listened. Peled asked
                        whether we thought he had been convincing. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WPC1"
                            >Warnke</persName> said he did not appear to have convinced the Air
                        Force. He said that while General Peled's sincerity in pleading his case was
                        not at all doubted, it was a difference of professional judgment. General
                        Peled asked if he may talk further with the Air Force people. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_WPC1">Warnke</persName> replied that he could and that
                        General Larson was the man to talk to. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WPC1"
                            >Warnke</persName> said that it would be the President who made the
                        decision, in any case.</p>
                    <p>General Carmon suggested that a draft letter of offer be completed for
                        General Peled to take back to Israel with him. Israel could then make
                        decisions and these decisions could be communicated to the United States
                        after the holidays. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WPC1">Warnke</persName>
                        agreed.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> raised the question
                        of publicity and said, somewhat unhappily, that he presumed that we wanted
                        to continue to say the same thing as before. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WPC1"
                            >Warnke</persName> said yes. We would say only that negotiations were
                        continuing. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SHH2">Schwartz</persName> suggested
                        this was a matter primarily for the Department of State.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> asked Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_WPC1">Warnke</persName> if he would like to sign the
                        agreement in Israel. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WPC1">Warnke</persName> said
                        he would like to very much but was not sure he would be able to do so.</p>

                            was in the establishment of peace, as set forth in the Resolution of

                            from June 5, 1967. The <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> position in
                            this respect was not clear and these questions must be answered before
                            further progress could be made in implementing <gloss target="#t_SC1"

                        <item>Rostow said US recognized importance of problem of withdrawal. He
                            cited with approval <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>'s
                            remarks on Arab distrust of Israel's intentions in this regard, and on
                            Israeli suspicions that Arabs do not intend peace, as the key to the
                            problem. <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName> had given a
                            functional definition of Israeli policy towards withdrawal, and said
                            that when the Arabs make clear their intent to make peace, Israel will
                            go into more detail on withdrawal. The Secretary, in his November 2
                            conversation with Riad, had spoken of complete withdrawal from Sinai,
                                <pb n="708" xml:id="pg_708" facs="0736"/>putting the question of
                            Gaza to one side for the moment, and saving the question of security
                            arrangements and guarantees of maritime rights. Withdrawal would be
                            subject to security arrangements, demilitarization and guarantees of
                            maritime rights. Israel did not want to be put in a position of having
                            to fight once more to regain those rights. Our position was that the
                            Secretary had given Riad powerful assurances on withdrawal from Sinai.
                            The guarantees on the other matters were not discussed by the <gloss

                            such but had legitimate interests under the Nov. 22 Resolution in

                            implications. Armistice lines were not final borders, but <persName

                                that Israel had not “accepted" Resolution. We thought debate on that

                                said Arabs and Soviets worried by fact Israel had not accepted
                                resolution while Arabs have. First step was for Israel to accept the
                                resolution. The second was to implement it. The <gloss

                                of implementation to which Israel had not responded.
                                    <persName>Rostow</persName> said the <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                                    >UAR</gloss> timetable was not complete, and in any event could
                                not be made a substitute for the agreement between the parties
                                required by para. 3 of Resolution. We had never objected to a
                                timetable as a way of carrying out agreement of parties. The first
                                question was how the parties could reach agreement.</p>

                                <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> willingness to implement the
                            resolution. <persName>Rostow</persName> said it was because US had yet
                            to get clear answers to its questions, either through Soviets or

                            clear that a multilateral document was acceptable to Sovs as a means of
                            embodying the agreement among the parties called for by the resolution,
                            but <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> had so far not given assurances
                            it would sign such a document. After experience of 1957, when US
                            negotiated on behalf of Egypt, and latter broke agreement when it closed
                            Strait of Tiran, Riad simply says he will give a letter to the Security
                            Council. This would not suffice. We have said there must be agreement if
                            we are to support withdrawal. We had no objection to a timetable if it
                            was part of an agreement, but <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                            proposal had made no reference to para. 3 of the Resolution nor answered

                            suggested the Soviet-Japanese procedure as a model. Secretary, in his
                            7th point, had indicated that document establishing peace must be signed
                            by both parties.</item>

                            agreed there must be legal, formal agreement, but there were several
                            forms it could take. If <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> proposed a

                                <persName>Rostow</persName> said this was a good point, but <gloss

                            clear to us. He cited the confusion regarding Riad's remarks on signing
                            the same document in his Nov. 2 conversation with the Secretary. A
                            document was needed, as with <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and
                            Japan. We have had no answer from <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> as
                            yet on this point. Israelis had taken important initiative, next step
                            was up to <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, which must define what it
                            had in mind with regard to (a) peace, (b) security and (c) maritime
                            rights. This could be done in a private meeting with <persName

                            and security arrangements could be settled. With all the ammunition
                            given to Riad by Secretary, <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> had not
                            yet moved. We had given Egyptians the US position. This was a major
                            step. We had expected a major step in reply, but Riad kept saying the
                            only important question is withdrawal.</item>

                                proposed that the Embassy be authorized to inform the Jordanian

                                military sales credits for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1969.
                                The Country Team proposed a breakdown for the program among the
                                requirements of the army, the air force, and the public security
                                program.</note> Believe following general guidelines appropriate:
                            (a) Internal security program should have highest priority, followed by
                            items required to maintain existing forces (spares, etc.), and only then
                            major new modernization items for army; (b) spare parts, uniforms,
                            ammunition and other maintenance-type items should be purchased for
                            cash. We can agree to annual open-end sales case for spares and minor
                            items which will permit, after annual approval, direct and expeditious
                            requisitioning by U.S. Military Departments. (c) We continue adhere to
                            earlier agreement to consider additional aircraft of same type at some
                            time in future. We are not prepared to go beyond this before: (1) we are
                            convinced <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> actually desires to have
                            first 18 aircraft in Jordan and operational and (2) they are so

                                at its greatest disadvantage between June 1969 and mid-1970.
                                However, he does not believe the Israelis could be fully ready to
                                maintain the planes much before January 1970. Also, delivering as
                                early as April, 1969, would require “an unacceptable drawdown of
                                spares" from <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> inventory.
                                Therefore, Bus recommends we begin delivery in September 1969. This
                                could be done without hurting the <gloss target="#t_USAF1"

                        refusal to restore the June 4, 1967 situation is absolute, basic and

                        interest which Israel considers worthy of all tenacity and sacrifice. We

                    <p>Paragraph 2. As against Israel's proposal on navigation in the Straits of
                        Tiran, it should be recalled that the U.A.R. has not even acknowledged
                        international character of the Tiran Straits and has specifically rejected
                        any permanent arrangement for protecting navigation more effectively than
                        hitherto. The Soviet paper, too, is completely silent on the freedom of
                        passage through the Straits. This strengthens Israel's view that without
                        Israel's presence there would be a repetition of aggressive U.A.R. action of
                        May 22.</p>
                    <p>Paragraph 3. U.A.R. reply to USA seven points is not “constructive" but
                        destructive. Israel's statement on the resolution in the November 4
                        memorandum is affirmative and legitimate. Israel will not make any
                        declaration on the resolution which excludes the concept of “agreement" as
                        the governing factor. Israel's attitude on timetable is that after
                        negotiations what is agreed would be implemented. There can only be a
                        timetable after agreement is reached directly between the Arab States and
                        Israel. At this time there can be no timetable since the Arab States have
                        refused to negotiate any agreements. Furthermore, it should be clear that
                        the establishment of peace is more than the “termination of the state of
                        belligerency" and more than what is called a “political solution.”</p>

                        “Idea" to which “Moscow agrees" is not shared by the USA.</p>
                    <p>Paragraph 5. Falsely glosses over the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                        rejection of the USA seven points and confirms Israel's apprehensions that
                        the seven points would encourage the illusion and discourage realism both in
                        Cairo and in Moscow, in addition to causing serious danger to Israel's
                        legitimate negotiating position.</p>
                    <p>Paragraph 6. Marks a retreat from previous hints given through <persName
                            corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> that the <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                            >UAR</gloss> would accept demilitarization arrangement in Sinai. Israel
                        rejects the Soviet-Egyptian idea of separate demilitarized zones “along
                        boundaries.” The <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> policy is to keep open
                        the possibility of making Sinai a springboard and base for future assaults
                        or intimidation.</p>

                    <p>Paragraph 7. Israel is a sovereign state exclusively responsible for its own
                        security and does not need to be “influenced" in the direction of realism.
                        Its positions as stated on November 4 are realistic and legitimate and it is
                        now for the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> to show a genuine interest

                                <item>Paragraph one. First paragraph of Soviet Note dealing with
                                    General Armistice Agreements is tendentious misinterpretation of
                                    what U.S. had told Soviets. <persName>Rostow</persName> had made
                                    this clear to <persName corresp="#p_TYN1">Tcherniakov</persName>
                                    and we would do so again in our formal reply to Soviet approach.
                                    Our position is that changes in 1949 Armistice lines are
                                    inevitable and desirable and are foreseen under terms of
                                    Armistice agreements. At same time we maintain that Armistice
                                    agreement provisions on this point should not be excuse for
                                    territorial expansion as such, that any changes in Armistice
                                    lines must be agreed and that extensive changes would be
                                    incompatible with our position and with <gloss target="#t_GOI1"

                                    rights. We recognize that this problem has two aspects: (1)
                                    acknowledgment of international character of Straits and (2)
                                    method of guaranteeing free navigation.</item>

                                    be encouraged not to cooperate with <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                                        >Jarring</persName>. <persName>Rostow</persName> said our
                                    entire dialogue with Soviets was designed to help <persName
                                        corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>. We were urging Soviets
                                    to prevail upon <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> to be more
                                    forthcoming with <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>
                                    and had made clear that we opposed idea of Four-Power approach
                                    as substitute for <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>
                                    Mission. Fact remained that there was considerable support in

                                        >Jarring</persName> should take more active role. For this
                                    reason we had urged Israelis to take initiatives with <persName

                                    Seven Points. We would give due attention to Israeli comments in

                        <item>In oral comments supplementing Aide-Memoire, <persName

                            conversation with Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KNB1"
                                >Katzenbach</persName> and quoted latter as stating that if Israel

                            would undermine that position. Hart corrected this interpretation,
                            noting <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> had said, in

                            concern that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> had in fact undermined
                            Israel's bargaining position by giving seven points to <gloss

                            the case only if Israel's position had changed and it now sought

                            <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> said that until recently
                            Israel had never understood it was US position that Israel should
                            withdraw to June 4 lines “give or take a few miles.” <persName
                                corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> said it now seemed that US had
                            in fact decided to undermine Israeli position. By telling <gloss
                                target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> that <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                >USG</gloss> envisaged Israeli withdrawal to June 4 lines plus
                            special arrangements for Gaza, <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> had
                            given away its own bargaining position with <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                                >UAR</gloss> and had demonstrated that it did not know how to deal
                            with Arabs. <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> would proceed from this
                            point and seek to erode US position on meaning of peace. Specifically,
                                <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> was now seeking to make

                            Seven Points, had made no mention of peace and had said nothing about

                            <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> said problem as he saw it
                            was that US (a) assumed others were as reasonable as it was and (b)
                            could not live with unsolved problems. Israel had to live with people
                            who were not reasonable and believed that solutions sometimes could be
                            achieved in long run by leaving problems unsolved. Until recently US and
                            Israel had created situation in which Soviets and <gloss
                                target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> were at disadvantage. If we continued
                            to show patience, their position would change. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> said he could not reconcile US
                            policy of past two months with President's Five Principles for Middle
                            East peace. In talking with <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and
                            Soviets, <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> was on dangerous course
                            unless it gave clear signal that it intended to stand by President's
                            Five Principles. <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> said that
                            in his view current US position could reduce chances for separate
                            Israeli settlement with Jordan.</item>

                            that we were on wrong course. Our policy had not changed; Secretary had
                            stressed President's Five Principles in his talk with Riad, making clear
                            there could be no withdrawal except to [<hi rend="italic"
                            >on</hi>?]condition of peace established through agreement. We had
                            relied on Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_EA1">Eban</persName>'s
                            statements to us in telling <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> we saw
                            no need for territorial changes in Sinai, on condition that there was
                            demilitarization and guaranteed free navigation.
                                <persName>Rostow</persName> said he could not see how this had
                            damaged Israel's negotiating position. As was case with our reply to
                            September approach by Soviets, <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> would
                            be reassured by our response to this latest Soviet communication. There
                            would be no change in fundamental US policy. We did not see that any
                            damage had been done to Israel's vital interests which, so far as <gloss
                                target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> was concerned, consisted of a
                            demilitarized Sinai and free navigation. With respect to Jordan, which
                            remained key to solution of Palestine problem, we believed that chances
                            of settlement with Jordan were better if dialogue was maintained with

                        <label>8.</label>
                        <item>Rostow concluded by assuring <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1"
                                >Rabin</persName> that we would take Israeli views into account in
                            our reply to Soviets. We could understand Israeli anxieties but saw
                            little substantive difference between us. <gloss target="#t_GOI1"
                                >GOI</gloss> should recognize that it too could be wrong.
                                <persName>Rostow</persName> reiterated that he could assure
                                <persName corresp="#p_RLGY1">Rabin</persName> there was no change in
                            US policy and no abandoning of vital US and Israeli interests in just
                            and durable peace. We would nail this down firmly in terms of the
                            President's stated policy in our reply to Soviets.
                                <persName>Rostow</persName> said he regretted first sentence of

                            nature by which the parties might be brought to accept an arrangement
                            providing the elements of a measure of real stability, security, and
                            tranquility in the area with some prospects of enduring.</item>

                        <item>Unfortunately, in my view, such an assessment must, at least by
                            implication, be based on a fundamentally non-existent major premise
                            which would be that the Arabs (read Egypt principally) desire or are
                            capable of being made to accept a settlement providing real security for
                            Israel, her recognition not only juridically but morally as having a
                            right to permanent existence, and her genuine acceptance, again morally
                            as well as juridically, as a Middle Eastern nation.</item>

                        <item>I do not believe that procedural tactics of whatever kind, which
                            merely paper over the cracks of abysmal differences in these respects,
                            can hope to achieve a settlement providing that degree of stability
                            which will avoid the continuation of American involvement in the Arab
                            political mire indefinitely.</item>

                        <item>Obviously, the present situation is not without dangers. However, I
                            think it is possible to and, if I am not mistaken, US public information
                            media do, exaggerate the present possibilities of renewal of large scale
                            hostilities. Israel's security position is obviously better on all
                            fronts than in May 1967; her casualties in the guerrilla clashes and
                            from sabotage, while serious, are regarded by the public here as
                            consistent with and not in excess of the price they are prepared to pay
                            for existence; and except for an aberrationally inspired air attack on
                            Tel Aviv there is little the Arabs could do to start a new
                            configuration.</item>

                        <item>The Israelis are, of course, concerned with the Soviet role in the
                            area. But if our assessment is that the Sovs are not prepared militarily
                            to support with Sov forces a new Arab initiative, it seems to me that
                                <pb n="725" xml:id="pg_725" facs="0753"/>the threat of a US-Sov
                            confrontation, which would be greatest in the event of renewed
                            hostilities in circumstances where Israel would be likely to lose and we
                            would be called upon to prevent her annihilation, is not immediate nor
                            need it be over the longer time, even if no solution is found.</item>
                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>My apprehension is that the Sovs succeed by diplomatic maneuver to
                            which we give verisimilitude in convincing the Arabs that us support for
                            Israel is less than firm. I believe strongly that we have been correct
                            to date in our refusal to be drawn into a negotiating posture with
                            regard to a solution and (in declining) to participate in any moves
                            toward an imposed settlement. Negative as it may sound, my view is that,
                            while we can and should nudge the parties toward each other, so long as
                            there is no fundamental change in the Arab inability to seek a genuine
                            viable peace on borders clearly defensible against Arab attack, our best
                            course is to make our basic sympathy toward Israel unmistakably clear,
                            and to continue to avoid becoming a broker in a deal where one party
                            refuses to trade.</item>

                    <p>On December 26, 1968, two members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of
                        Palestine attacked an Israeli El Al aircraft in the airport in Athens,
                        Greece, with automatic weapons and grenades. One passenger was killed and a
                        crew member was injured in the attack; both were Israeli citizens. The plane
                        caught fire and was severely damaged. The two men who launched the attack
                        were captured and jailed by the Greek Government. The Popular Front issued a
                        statement from its office in Beirut taking responsibility for the attack.
                        Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Eshkol</persName> denounced the
                        assault as a murderous attack on innocent civilians, and the Israeli press
                        noted that the terrorists had come from Lebanon. (Telegram 6618 from Tel

                    <p>Israel held Lebanon responsible for the actions of a group based on Lebanese
                        soil and retaliated with an attack on December 28 on Beirut International
                        Airport. An estimated 45 Israeli commandos landed in 4 helicopters and
                        attacked planes and facilities at the airport with grenades and machine guns
                        for 20 minutes before withdrawing. Thirteen Lebanese-owned aircraft were
                        destroyed. (Memorandum for the Record by Rear Admiral Robert Baughan, Deputy

                        that meeting Israeli request would make it even more intransigent and that
                        timing of announcement was most inappropriate in view of recent progress of

                                    was in any way involved. To contrary there are strong

                                    although we have no knowledge of casualties it seems likely that

                            we find a great difference between the action of two deranged or
                            misguided individuals who happened to come from Beirut and the action of
                            a government using its armed forces to violate the air space of a
                            country and to attack its international airport. We believe this an
                            inexcusable retaliatory act striking at innocent people and facilities
                            and also greatly impairing US interests. We understand the deep feelings
                            motivating the Israelis but noted that we have some provocation from
                            Cuba in the form of hijacking aircraft and imprisoning American
                            citizens. The quality and nature of US actions in handling these
                            problems are in stark contrast to those of Israel. To hold the
                            Government of Lebanon wholly responsible and then to express this by
                            striking at innocent people and international facilities is
                            incomprehensible. We consider this a dangerous escalation all out of
                            proportion to the provocation.</item>

                        of Lebanese request for urgent convening of Security Council to hear
                        complaint against Israeli attack on Beirut International Airport.</p>
                    <p>2. Ambassador sought <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> support for a
                        resolution embodying three points: a) a condemnation of the Israeli action,
                        b) compensation for damages and attendant losses, and c) sanctions if Israel
                        does not provide compensation.</p>
                    <p>3. Ambassador was informed <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> extremely
                        disturbed by Israeli action and would take Lebanese request into
                        consideration in developing its position.</p>
                    <p>4. In ensuing discussion, Ambassador rebutted Israeli charges of <gloss
                            target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss> complicity in terrorist actions and noted:
                        a) Lebanese press completely free and Government cannot prevent publication
                        communiqués of Palestine Liberation Organizations; b) baggage of embarking
                        passengers customarily not subject to customs inspections at Beirut Airport;
                        c) there is absolutely no evidence that sabotage material used in Athens was
                        in fact carried from Beirut by the two men involved in the attack against
                        Israeli plane; d) Front for Liberation of Palestine states two terrorists
                        involved only transited through Beirut from occupied Palestine; e) the
                            <gloss target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss> has done its utmost to prevent
                        attacks against Israel from being launched from Lebanese territory; and f)
                        it is not true that <gloss target="#t_PFLOP1">PFLOP</gloss> headquarters are
                        in Beirut as it is untrue that there are training camps for terrorists in

                        Jordan, whose total number, he said, was just over 10,000 (about half our
                        present estimate); (C) the 14-point arrangement was working satisfactorily

                        Fedayeen groups were giving him trouble; (D) Gromyko apparently had used in

                        could influence Israel; (E) he would take a special interest in problem of

                        <item>I had a lengthy meeting with King Hussein on 28th: Phantom
                            announcement. I opened the conversation by saying that I had not
                            anticipated the Phantom announcement would have been made just before my
                            audience. I commented that the President and others had already made
                            clear that whatever we did on the Phantoms should not be taken as any
                            diminution of our support for Jordan. Unfortunately other factors in the
                            area had made the Phantom deal a foregone conclusion, citing as examples
                            the absence of some dramatic improvement in the Arab-Israel
                            confrontation or Soviet willingness to discuss practical arms control
                            with US. <persName>Hussein</persName> shook his head and said
                            emphatically that he considered the announcement most unfortunate and
                            that he believed it could not fail to have a bad effect on situation in
                            Middle East. He was very sorry to hear news of the conclusion of the
                            deal.</item>

                        <item>Iraqi troops. I told <persName>Hussein</persName> that we remained
                            concerned about the Iraqi troops in Jordan. When he was here, Governor
                            Scranton had been quite interested in the implications of their
                            presence. More recently we have received significantly different
                            estimates from various sources of number of Iraqis in Jordan. We hear
                            from some sources that there may be more than 20,000 and from other
                            sources that there are just over 10,000. <persName>Hussein</persName>
                            interjected that there were just over 10,000. I asked if there were not
                            other supporting troops, in addition to the three <pb n="733"
                                xml:id="pg_733" facs="0761"/>brigades. <persName>Hussein</persName>
                            said emphatically that there are just over 10,000 in all and that he
                            intends to be very careful about allowing any more. King also said that
                            recent removal of Chief of Staff Ansari and other Iraqis has further
                            complicated the situation. He said that he believes Communists are
                            determined to get rid of the Ba'athists and that the Communists have a
                            good base in Iraq to do this. He mentioned that the Iraqis in Jordan are
                            very upset about the most recent changes. In conclusion, he said he is
                            well aware of and worried about the Iraqi troops in Jordan and is
                            keeping a very careful eye on them. He said, “We are penetrating them
                            instead of having them penetrate us.”</item>

                        <item>Fedayeen. The King said he believes the 14-point arrangement has been
                            working all right with Fatah and some of the other groups but that the
                            “Front" and groups like the “Front" are giving him considerable trouble.
                            Just yesterday, the 27th, on the outskirts of Amman, he said, three
                            rival groups in the “Front" had had a fire fight. (By Front, I presume
                            King meant Popular Front—<gloss target="#t_PFLP1">PFLP</gloss>.)</item>

                        <item>Soviet Initiatives. I asked the King whether he had any comments on
                            Gromyko's visit to Cairo. The King said a report from his Ambassadors in
                            Cairo had not indicated anything startlingly new. It was consistent with
                            what the Soviet Ambassador had said to him when he called before leaving
                            for Moscow a few days ago: that is, the Soviets want peace, they want to
                            prevent conflagration in the Middle East, they are supporting the Arabs
                            as strongly as they can, and they think the United States should use its
                            influence more effectively with Israel. The Soviet Ambassador had also
                            informed him that the Soviets had had contacts with the United States
                            about the situation but they had not reached any conclusive
                            results.</item>

                        <item>Refugees and Displaced Persons. I outlined our efforts during current
                                <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> to induce Israel to allow more
                            displaced persons to return to West Bank. I said we would continue these
                            efforts. Meanwhile, as I had mentioned to him on several previous
                            occasions, I hoped we could continue our discussions with <gloss
                                target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> on how the displaced persons on East
                            Bank would be fed in coming months. I said our contacts with <gloss
                                target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> levels below the Prime Minister had not
                            been fruitful so far, and that I believed some indication of interest
                            and a green light were needed from higher levels. I had not had an
                            opportunity so far to mention this to the PriMin. I hoped that the King
                            could indicate his interest in our at least having detailed discussions
                            without any commitment on either side. The King agreed that this was
                            important and said that he would make clear his interest in it.</item>

                            certain yet how long he expected to be gone but that he thought it would
                            be about three weeks. His first operation (on his jaw) would be on
                            January 9 and would require a general anesthetic. He had been <pb

                        <item>During my meeting with King Hussein on 28th, I said I was happy to
                            report considerable progress in certain aspects in the military field.
                            Most important, it appeared we might be able to get some credit for
                            Jordan's purchases in the present fiscal year. I did not yet know how
                            much this would be, but I believed it would be very helpful to
                            Jordan.</item>

                        <item>I then noted that we were ready to schedule air transport delivery of
                            the F-104's, with the first to arrive commencing February 3. A 25-day
                            period would be required to assemble and test fly the aircraft. Assuming
                            six aircraft would be delivered each month, the whole squadron could be
                            ready by the end of May. In other words, our schedule had been advanced
                            by 30 days. I noted that General Kurdi had explained to DATT that H-5
                            air base would not be operational before March 1st and he preferred that
                            no deliveries take place before that date. The King acknowledged that he
                            was aware of this and said he was happy that the 104's would be coming
                            in.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>I cited several examples of proposed accelerated deliveries of other
                            items. I told the King I was mentioning these details because I hoped he
                            could use them to show critics of his arms relationship with us that we
                            not only were able to deliver on time but that we were making
                            significant advances in delivery dates whenever we could.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>I said we had been exploring with General <persName corresp="#p_KGA1"
                                >Khammash</persName> and others Jordanian requests for additional
                            materiel. I was confident that these new Jordanian requests could be
                            examined under the annual review mechanism provided in the March 1968
                            Memorandum of Understanding.<note n="2" xml:id="d372fn2">See <ref

                            changes under the new administration with a consequent settling-down
                            period, I suggested we might best aim for sometime in March for that
                            visit. Meanwhile, we would strive to get as much done as possible in
                            communications with Washington. I emphasized that we are still prepared
                            to consider supplying additional aircraft of some type at some time in
                            the future. I said it seemed to me important, however, that Jordan first
                            get its 18 F-104's located in Jordan and operational. In principle, the
                            option certainly remained open, I concluded.</item>

                        <item>The King expressed thanks at various points in my presentation and I
                            gathered that he was pleased with the accelerated delivery dates and
                            with the general indication of our willingness to consider Jordanian

                        <item>Internal Security. I told the King that we had had detailed
                            discussions with <persName corresp="#p_KGA1">Khammash</persName> and
                            former security chief Abu Nuwar with regard to proposed equipping of the
                            three-battalion Bedouin force, after which we had had further useful
                            discussions with the British Embassy. I hoped that in a short time we
                            might be able to get down to the specifics of financing (which might be
                            a problem), as well as actual orders and deliveries of both US and
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> equipment. The King laughed and
                            commented that we would now have to talk to Mohammad Rasoul Kaylani (who
                            has just replaced General Abu Nuwar). I said I assumed that, since
                            General <persName corresp="#p_KGA1">Khammash</persName> had had a “heavy
                            hand" on the equipment aspects, we would not have any new problems with
                            Kaylani.</item>

                        I broached with the King the issue of secret Israeli-Jordanian contacts. I
                        am convinced that the King welcomed this initiative. In addition to
                        supplying considerable details about substance of these contacts, the King
                        made clear that the channel with Israel was still open if the Israelis
                        wanted to use it, but it was up to them, he emphasized. He said he could do
                        nothing more unless or until the Israelis became more forthcoming. He
                        stressed that secret talks with Israel could only be complementary to, not a
                        substitute for, talks through <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>.

                        <item>During my lengthy meeting with <persName>Hussein</persName> on 28th, I
                            told him that I wanted to raise a very sensitive matter which I had
                            wanted to discuss with him for a long time but for a number of reasons
                            had been unable to do so. I said I was referring specifically to the
                            paper he had given Governor Scranton regarding secret contacts Jordan
                            had had with Israel.<note n="3" xml:id="d373fn3">See <ref
                                    target="#d344fn2">footnote 2, Document 344</ref>.</note> I had
                            known generally about these contacts but I had not been in a position to
                            discuss them with him. I personally had detected indications that in the
                            coming weeks there might be in some ways a more active U.S.
                            participation in the peace-making process under <persName
                                corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>'s auspices. I wished to make
                            clear that the U.S. continues to want to reinforce and complement the
                                <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> Mission in
                            constructive ways. I also wanted to make clear that we stand firmly by
                            the assurances that have been given to him. My present approach to him
                            was a purely personal and informal one. I particularly wanted him to
                            know that I could pass on in a secure way anything further he wished us
                            to know about sensitive contacts he had had with the Israelis. It seemed
                            to me there was mutual benefit in our being able to discuss this matter
                            in detail in the coming weeks. I added that I had never discussed the
                            subject with anyone in his government; for example, I had reason to
                            believe that Abdul Mun'im Rifai probably was not privy to the sensitive
                            contacts with Israel. (The King affirmed that this was true.) I then
                            referred to the King's forthcoming visit to England and said I thought
                            it would be useful to him to let me know if there is any Jordanian
                            official now in the know with whom I might discuss this general subject
                                <pb n="737" xml:id="pg_737" facs="0765"/>if necessary during his
                            absences from the country. I added that I personally believed there was
                            “give" in most aspects of the Israeli position and it would be useful
                            for him to try to flush out their attitudes particularly on how
                            withdrawal from the West Bank would be organized.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>The King responded that he indeed thought it would be useful for us to
                            have such an informal relationship in the coming period because he very
                            much hoped the United States would take a more active role, but still
                            under the aegis of <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>. He
                            said he would think over the situation in the coming days before he
                            departs and would get in touch with me to let me know with whom I might
                            talk during his absences if that were necessary. Meanwhile he wanted to
                            brief me on what had transpired so far.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>

                            <persName>Hussein</persName> said that talks with the Israelis have gone
                            on “for some long time.” In spite of all the contacts, however, there
                            had been no discernible give in any specific aspects of the Israeli
                            position. “In effect, the Israelis keep giving us their general position
                            and we keep giving them ours.” As far as Jordan is concerned, the Nov 22
                            resolution contains the principles under which a settlement is to be
                            worked out. The principles do not allow for any bargaining. It is
                            details under the principles that need to be discussed. In regards to
                            principles, however, Jordan had to make perfectly clear that it must
                            have the <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> umbrella: that
                            is, that while details might be discussed by secret contacts, such
                            discussions were only an aid and could not be a substitute for reaching
                            agreement under the aegis of <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                                >Jarring</persName>. Anything discussed in secret with Israel would
                            have to be made known to <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>
                            to be passed on officially.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>Another essential principle for Jordan is that the <gloss
                                target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> must be associated with the <persName
                                corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> process. Jordan at this time was
                            unable to go it alone. <persName>Hussein</persName> indicated that even
                            if he were willing to go it alone he thought any separate settlement
                            reached with Israel would not endure. <persName>Hussein</persName>
                            referred parenthetically to recent US-<gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                                >UAR</gloss> discussions of the seven points and emphasized that we
                            should not consider that Syria presents a problem. Jordan and the <gloss
                                target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> are not in a position completely to
                            disregard Syria and could make no public statement to that effect. On
                            the other hand, if arrangements could be made between Israel and Jordan
                            and the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, Syria could be left
                            aside.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>A third essential principle for Jordan is that Israel must publicly
                            accept the principle of withdrawal from territory occupied in June 1967.
                            The resolution provides that there shall be no territorial aggression.
                            It also provides that boundaries are to be discussed and that there may
                            be some territorial modifications; but unless the principle of
                            withdrawal is accepted by Israel, Jordan will be unable to move further
                            toward a peaceful settlement.</item>

                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>A final principle is that any territorial changes must be made on a
                            basis of “reciprocity.” <persName>Hussein</persName> used the word
                            “reciprocity" several times during his conversation. I think he meant
                            that if Jordan agrees to a territorial change in one place it will have
                            to be compensated by some territory elsewhere on at least a face-saving
                            basis. He used the word “reciprocity" in discussing security as well. He
                            stressed, for example, that he had told the Israelis repeatedly that
                            security must be worked out on a basis of reciprocity. He is fully
                            prepared to accept the notion that Israel has security concerns, but he
                            also expects Israel to recognize that Jordan has security
                            concerns.</item>

                            <persName>Hussein</persName> discussed some of the specifics that the
                            Israelis have thrown out in the secret contacts. With regard to
                            territory, the Israelis have said they want a 12-kilometer-wide strip
                            running along the Jordan River from the north (Tiberias) to a point a
                            few miles north of Jericho. Jordan would be allowed to have corridors
                            across this strip. The Israelis have noted also that they expect
                            boundary changes in the west. <persName>Hussein</persName> mentioned no
                            specifics with regard to Latroun and Qalqiliya, but he said that in
                            addition to the boundary changes the Israelis insist upon the new
                            western frontier being completely opened for all Israelis. The Israelis
                            also want a strip of territory running to the Hebron area (sic). They
                            have indicated in a general way that they would consider giving Jordan
                            access to Mediterranean port facilities. With regard to Gaza, their last
                            word was that they want to keep it, but there were some indications they
                            might be willing to discuss its future.</item>

                        <item>Far from giving anything on Jerusalem the Israelis have taken a very
                            hard line, and <persName>Hussein</persName> said that he could see that
                            all Jordan would get was “access to the Holy Places.”
                                <persName>Hussein</persName> said that “sovereignty" over what it
                            previously had in Jerusalem is important to Jordan and that the Israelis
                            so far had given him no hope of an arrangement in Jerusalem as “a city
                            of peace" which would no longer be the cause of division between Arabs
                            and Israelis but would be the place where they would meet. He did not go
                            into any details of what kind of practical administration this would
                            entail in his view, and because there was so much else to discuss I
                            decided not to probe him for details.</item>

                        <item>On refugees the King said the Israelis were proposing that Jordan and
                            Israel form a sort of bilateral committee to discuss the status and
                            disposition of the refugees. The King had responded that this was
                            unacceptable to Jordan and Jordan's position is that the existing <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolutions on refugees must be applied,
                            at least in principle. He believed firmly that Jordan and Israel alone
                            could not effectively settle the refugee problem and that the
                            international community must be involved.</item>

                        <item>The King said the Israelis were still insisting upon signing some kind
                            of “government-to-government" document. Jordan did not <pb n="739"
                                xml:id="pg_739" facs="0767"/>take the position that it would never
                            sign any kind of document. On the other hand, the way the Israelis kept
                            putting it, it appeared that they wanted a government-to-government
                            peace treaty of the traditional sort. This was not acceptable.</item>

                            illustrative ideas. The King did not respond specifically but commented
                            that Israeli insistence on a demilitarized West Bank gave him no
                            problems. As he had already indicated to me, he was prepared to maintain
                            only public security forces on the West Bank. On the other hand, things
                            like the <persName corresp="#p_AY1">Allon</persName> plan would give him
                            a problem, and he had stressed to the Israelis that Jordan also had
                            security interests. Security was reciprocal, he reiterated, but, even
                            more important, security would be a fruit of peace and would flow from
                            an acceptable implementation of the resolution.</item>

                            <persName>Hussein</persName> concluded this section of the conversation
                            by saying that despite the negative summary he had given me he wanted to
                            make clear that the channel is still open if the Israelis want to use
                            it. It is up to them. The ball is in their court. “Unless they are
                            willing to help me on the principles I have outlined, I can do nothing
                            more.” When the King mentioned this to me another time, I emphasized to
                            him that we would not be saying anything to the Israelis about this
                            discussion and that I assumed that he already had told the Israelis that
                            the ball was in their court. He indicated that this was the case.</item>

                            left to let me know if there were any late developments and also whom I
                            might talk to in his absence.</item>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TYN1">Tcherniakov</persName>, Charge d'Affaires of
                        the Soviet Union, came in to see me at 6:30 p.m. this evening to bring two
                        documents from his government. The first was a general policy statement on
                        the Middle East to accompany the second document which is a so-called “plan"
                        for the solution of the Middle East situation. I emphasize that both of
                        these documents now being transmitted are unofficial translations. We will
                        get to you an official translation, taken directly from the Russian text,
                        sometime tomorrow.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TYN1">Tcherniakov</persName> said that he did not
                        believe that the Soviet Union was planning to make this communication
                        public. I asked him to confirm this with Moscow and that we would assume
                        that it is not being made public unless we hear to the contrary from him. He
                        also said that the same communication is being given to the British and
                        French Governments.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TYN1">Tcherniakov</persName> added that the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is of the opinion that the <gloss
                            target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> is in agreement with the plan which they
                        are now submitting. This undoubtedly reflects the outcome of Mr.
                            <persName>Gromyko</persName>'s visit to Cairo. You will recall that we
                        had from Egyptian sources the Egyptian impression that Gromyko would be in
                        touch with us following his visit to Cairo.</p>
                    <p>I told <persName corresp="#p_TYN1">Tcherniakov</persName> that I would not
                        wish to reply off-the-cuff and that I would get this communication to you as
                        soon as practicable. He <pb n="741" xml:id="pg_741" facs="0769"/>knows that
                        you are in Texas. I would like to study it very carefully before giving you
                        my considered opinion. My first reaction is that it looks a bit toward what
                        we could accept as a final settlement but is not yet good enough. I have in
                        mind such matters as the handling of the passage of the Suez Canal and the
                        continued insistence that the withdrawal of Israeli forces to the lines of
                        June 4th is, in effect, a prerequisite to agreement on all other subjects.
                        There is no flexibility in this present Russian plan for any modification of
                        frontiers. On the other hand, the present Russian communication does seem to
                        accept the idea of a package and that may give us some basis on which we can
                        pursue the conversation.</p>

                    <p>In continuation of the exchange of opinion with the American side with regard
                        to the situation in the Middle East I am instructed to state the following
                        to be transmitted to President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1"
                            >Johnson</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Moscow takes with serious concern the situation now developing in the Middle
                        East in view of the absence there of any real movement towards achieving a
                        stable political settlement. The pertinent facts are well known to the US
                        Government and there is no need to dwell upon them.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Union in the course of the entire present Middle East conflict has
                        consistently advocated its settlement by political means and consequently
                        has maintained and continues to maintain contacts with the governments of
                        Arab states which we believe has facilitated a constructive evolution in the
                        approach on the part of those countries towards the problem of settlement
                        with Israel.</p>
                    <p>The Arab states, first of all the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, are
                        known to have formally recognized the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                        Security Council resolution of November 22, 1967, and declared with all
                        clarity their readiness to implement the provisions therein. Moreover, the
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, as is known, has spoken in favor of
                        working out a time-table for stage-by-stage implementation of the
                        resolution, i.e. all its provisions and has put forward concrete
                        considerations in that regard, which the American Government has already
                        examined earlier.</p>
                    <p>Finally, one cannot but note the constructive nature of the <gloss
                            target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> Government's answer to the “7 points"
                        introduced by the US Secretary of State last November.</p>
                    <p>That answer, while confirming the already noted positive aspects in the
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> position, in addition specifies the
                        Egyptian position on such questions of principle as termination of the state
                        of belligerency, freedom of navigation, refugee problem, guaranteeing
                        implementation of <pb n="742" xml:id="pg_742" facs="0770"/>the commitments
                        with regard to the settlement, <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                        participation in implementing the settlement. The <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                            >UAR</gloss> answer is in full accord with the November 22 Security
                        Council resolution.</p>
                    <p>Thus, there can hardly be doubt in anyone's mind as to the good will on the
                        part of the Arab states and their readiness for a just political settlement
                        of the conflict which would ensure stabilization of the situation in the
                        Middle East.</p>
                    <p>Now, what is the Israeli position? Are there any real positive changes in her
                        position?</p>
                    <p>One should state, that, in fact, there are no such changes. Moreover, the
                        Israeli forces do not cease armed provocations in the areas of the Suez
                        Canal and Jordan River; public statements by the leaders of Tel-Aviv testify
                        to the fact that expansionist mood influences more and more the policy of
                        Israel.</p>
                    <p>The basic question of the Middle Eastern settlement is, undoubtedly, the
                        necessity of complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Arab territories
                        seized by them. As we understand the US Government also realizes the primary
                        importance of the solution of this question. Notice was taken in Moscow of
                        the statement by Under Secretary of State Mr. <persName corresp="#p_REV1"
                            >Eugene Rostow</persName> in the conversation with the Soviet Ambassador
                        on November 8 to the effect that Israel has no territorial claims against
                        the Arab countries and is ready for settlement on the basis of the
                        demarkation lines under the Armistice Agreement in 1949.</p>
                    <p>However, subsequent statements by the Israelis themselves have in fact
                        disavowed such an assertion. This clearly follows, for example, from the
                        remarks made by Israeli <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Representative Mr.
                            <persName>Tekaoh</persName> in the conversation with Deputy Minister for
                        Foreign Affairs of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> Mr.
                            <persName>Semenov</persName> that took place in New York at <persName
                            corresp="#p_TY1">Tekoah</persName>'s initiative. Incidentally other
                        remarks by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TY1">Tekoah</persName> in this
                        conversation do not show any reasonableness and soberness on the part of the
                        Israelis either.</p>
                    <p>Moscow would like to hope that the US Government understands to what
                        dangerous consequences could lead in the long run such a defiant behavior of
                        Israel.</p>
                    <p>The Arab countries show their readiness for a peaceful settlement and for
                        contributing constructively to its achievement. The conversation between the
                        Foreign Minister of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the
                        leaders of the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, which took place
                        recently, fully confirms such a conclusion. At the same time one should keep
                        in mind that in the circumstances of the continued aggression on the part of
                        Israel the Arab countries, naturally, have taken and are taking maximum
                        efforts to strengthen their military power. And nobody can blame them for
                        doing so in the face of such a position of Israel.</p>
                    <p>In Israel, and not only in Israel, one can hear arguments to the effect that
                        time, perhaps, works for Israel and therefore they could be in <pb n="743"
                            xml:id="pg_743" facs="0771"/>no hurry with the settlement on the
                        conflict. This is a dangerous delusion. And if Israel does not show
                        prudence, one can not exclude any surprises, such a turn of events that
                        would be not only contrary to the interests of the Middle Eastern countries,
                        naturally including Israel, but also would create a situation of crisis
                        extending beyond the limits of that area.</p>
                    <p>Under these circumstances, it is the duty of all states, sincerely interested
                        in stabilizing the situation in the Middle East, to take urgent and
                        determined measures to prevent a new flare-up there through speediest
                        achievement of a just, peaceful settlement on the basis of the resolution of
                        the Security Council unanimously adopted on November 22, 1967. We proceed
                        also from the assumption that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JG1"
                            >Jarring</persName>'s mission serves these purposes and in our opinion
                        it should be supported in every possible way.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Union, in pursuing its policy of strengthening international peace
                        and security, which was demonstrated anew by its contribution to the
                        beginning of settlement of the Vietnam conflict, will continue to do
                        everything depending on it to prevent a flare-up of a new crisis in the
                        Middle East.</p>
                    <p>Attainment of a real progress in the political settlement of the Middle East
                        conflict as well as a further progress in peace settlement in Vietnam would
                        undoubtedly affect in a most positive way the entire world situation and
                        would create more favorable conditions for the development of
                        Soviet-American relations.</p>
                    <p>The main obstacle in the way of attaining a Middle East settlement continues
                        to lie in the negative position of Israel. Therefore, hope is expressed in
                        Moscow that the US Government will regard with all seriousness the
                        considerations we set above and will take urgent measures to exert proper
                        influence on Tel-Aviv so as to make them adopt, at last, a realistic
                        position.</p>
                    <p>To facilitate finding a solution to the Middle East crisis the Soviet
                        Government has prepared a plan containing new proposals, which are fully
                        based on the above mentioned resolution of the Security Council and take
                        into account the recently emerged moments favorable to the achievement of
                        agreement on a peace settlement in the Middle East.</p>
                    <p>We are ready to continue further exchanges of views with the American side on
                        the questions of a Middle Eastern settlement.</p>

                        <item>FonMin Hajj Hussein Oweini called me in afternoon Dec 30 to have a
                            “completely frank discussion" of consequences of Israeli attack <pb

                            Airport. Speaking as “friend of US” (which he is), he wished me to know
                            that, unfortunately, incident has created serious obstable in path
                            traditional US-Lebanese friendship, one which can only be removed by
                            subsequent US actions. Lebanon realizes Israel acted without prior
                            knowledge of US but Lebanese are convinced Israelis would not have
                            embarked on raid if they had not been confident repercussions would not
                            be great and would not risk loss of US support. Therefore, it
                            particularly important that Israel sustain more than just verbal
                            condemnation which would soon gather dust with other <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolutions. Lebanon calls upon US to use
                            its influence in Tel Aviv to assure that Israel is made to understand
                            that she must pay for her crime.</item>

                            since US is responsible for sustaining existence of Israel through
                            constant material support. The US will be in most difficult position in
                            Arab world if it does not now act to restrain Israelis and redress the
                            wrong against Lebanon. Arab public opinion, both in Lebanon and outside,
                            is turning more and more against the US and our friends in Arab
                            governments are diminishing.</item>

                            he pointed out, can enter and leave Lebanon freely. The two commandos
                            were not Lebanese, were not trained in Lebanon, and were not recently
                            residing in Lebanon. They merely transited Beirut on way to Athens, like
                            hundreds of other travelers daily in Lebanon's open society.</item>

                        <item>Arabs cannot accept that Israeli raid was result of Athens incident;
                            rather it came because Lebanon is weakest of Arab countries and has an
                            open undefended airport. What hurts is fact that Israelis used “US arms
                            and equipment,” provided them for use in self-defense, for opposite
                            purpose of aggression against friend of US. Unfortunately, announcement
                            US decision sell Phantom aircraft to Israel inextricably viewed by Arabs
                            as giving Israelis added confidence attack her weak neighbor to north.
                            Hajj Hussein implored US reconsider decision supply Israel with Phantoms
                            which would only be used to attack weaker Arab neighbors and sustain her
                            position in occupied lands. Arabs cannot accept view that Israeli
                            possession Phantoms would impede extension Soviet influence in Middle
                            East, he added. On contrary, Arabs will now have to turn to Soviets for
                            comparable support.</item>

                        <item>Hajj Hussein noted that whole world called upon Israel withdraw from
                            Arab territories in November 22 Security Council resolution. This action
                            produced no results because Israel, feeling it has US support, defies
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. Therefore, mere Security Council

                    <p>CAP 82970. Following is a memorandum to me from Hal Saunders on responding to
                        the Soviet Middle East initiative. Sec. <persName corresp="#p_RD1"
                            >Rusk</persName> will be formulating his view in the next day or so.</p>
                    <p>“I believe the time has come to pick up where we left off on November 22,
                        1967. An intense period of negotiation with Russians, Arabs and Israelis
                        produced the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolution. Then we stepped
                        back to give <pb n="748" xml:id="pg_748" facs="0776"/>
                        <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> a chance to arrange agreements
                        that would carry out the resolution's intent. So far he has failed. Most of
                        us, I believe, feel he will need more direct help from us and the Soviets if
                        he's to get anywhere. Only the Israelis argue today that mounting tension
                        will bring the Arabs closer to negotiation, and their eye-for-an-eye
                        judgment is questionable.</p>
                    <p>The issue today is whether we move toward another period of intense
                        five-or-six-cornered negotiation to establish a scenario for working out
                        agreement under the resolution. When <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                            >Dobrynin</persName> delivered a similar memo<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d376fn2">See <ref target="#d245">Document 245</ref>.</note>
                        right after the Czech invasion, we answered by urging the Soviets to get
                        behind <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName>. That was reasonable
                        because <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> was just starting his
                        New York phase. But that produced little, and now he needs help.</p>
                    <p>If we go down this course, these points are crucial: <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>Our first effort should be to impose a negotiation-not a solution.
                                The Soviet note<note n="3" xml:id="d376fn3">See <ref target="#d374"
                                        >Document 374</ref>.</note> speaks of contacts through
                                    <persName corresp="#p_JG1">Jarring</persName> to work out a
                                timetable for withdrawal and resolution of other issues in the
                                resolution. The purpose of this document, therefore, might be to
                                arrive at an agreement to negotiate a timetable. Perhaps this could
                                be an elaboration of the first page and a half of the Soviet memo.
                                Then we would have a three-step process: <list>

                            <item>We must bring the Israelis with us as we did in October-November
                                1967. We have lost their confidence since November 1967. They're
                                bitterly suspicious of our past exchanges with the Soviets. Yet our
                                main contribution to imposing a negotiation would be to bring the
                                Israelis along. Therefore, I would urge giving Rabin the Soviet memo
                                today, telling him that we are going to prepare a counterdraft and
                                asking him to study and return to discuss an appropriate counter. I
                                think State will do this.</item>

                            <item>The Soviets must bring the Arabs along. Gromyko obviously has
                                Cairo behind this memo. But the point is that Moscow must be willing
                                to keep Cairo behind subsequent negotiations.</item>
                        </list>
                    </p>
                    <p>These are just rough initial thoughts. The central point is my belief that we
                        should now move back into intense involvement in the negotiation
                        process.</p>
