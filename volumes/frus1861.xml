                <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Fellow-citizens of the Senate and House of
                        Representatives:</hi></p>
                <p>In the midst of unprecedented political troubles, we have cause of great
                    gratitude to God for unusual good health, and most abundant harvests.</p>
                <p>You will not be surprised to learn that, in the peculiar exigencies of the times,
                    our intercourse with foreign nations has been attended with profound solicitude,
                    chiefly turning upon our own domestic affairs.</p>
                <p>A disloyal portion of the American people have, during the whole year, been
                    engaged in an attempt to divide and destroy the Union. A nation which endures
                    factious domestic division, is exposed to disrespect abroad; and one party, if
                    not both, is sure, sooner or later, to invoke foreign intervention.</p>
                <p>Nations thus tempted to interfere, are not always able to resist the counsels of
                    seeming expediency and ungenerous ambition, although measures adopted under such
                    influences seldom fail to be unfortunate and injurious to those adopting
                    them.</p>
                <p>The disloyal citizens of the United States who have offered the ruin of our
                    country, in return for the aid and comfort which they have invoked abroad, have
                    received less patronage and encouragement than they probably expected. If it
                    were just to suppose, as the insurgents have seemed to assume, that foreign
                    nations, in this case, discarding all moral, social, and treaty obligations,
                    would act solely, and selfishly, for the most speedy restoration of commerce,
                    including, especially, the acquisition of cotton, those nations appear, as yet,
                    not to have seen their way to their object more directly, or clearly, through
                    the destruction, than through the preservation, of the Union. If we could dare
                    to believe that foreign nations are actuated by no higher principle than this, I
                    am quite sure a sound argument could be made to show them that they can reach
                    their aim more readily, and easily, by aiding to crush this rebellion, than by
                    giving encouragement to it.</p>
                <p>The principal lever relied on by the insurgents for exciting foreign <pb n="4"
                        xml:id="pg_4" facs="0004"/> nations to hostility against us, as already
                    intimated, is the embarrassment of commerce. Those nations, however, not
                    improbably, saw from the first, that it was the Union which made, as well our
                    foreign, as our domestic commerce. They can scarcely have failed to perceive
                    that the effort for disunion produces the existing difficulty; and that one
                    strong nation promises more durable peace, and a more extensive, valuable and
                    reliable commerce, than can the same nation broken into hostile fragments.</p>
                <p>It is not my purpose to review our discussions with foreign states; because
                    whatever might be their wishes, or dispositions, the integrity of our country,
                    and the stability of our government, mainly depend, not upon them, but on the
                    loyalty, virtue, patriotism, and intelligence of the American people. The
                    correspondence itself, with the usual reservations, is herewith submitted.</p>
                <p>I venture to hope it will appear that we have practiced prudence, and liberality
                    towards foreign powers, averting causes of irritation; and, with firmness,
                    maintaining our own rights and honor.</p>
                <p>Since, however, it is apparent that here, as in every other state, foreign
                    dangers necessarily attend domestic difficulties, I recommend that adequate and
                    ample measures be adopted for maintaining the public defenses on every side.
                    While, under this general recommendation, provision for defending our sea-coast
                    line readily occurs to the mind, I also, in the same connation, ask the
                    attention of Congress to our great lakes and rivers. It is believed that some
                    fortifications and depots of arms and munitions, with harbor and navigation
                    improvements, all at well selected points upon these, would be of great
                    importance to the national defense and preservation. I ask attention to the
                    views of the Secretary of War, expressed in his report, upon the same general
                    subject.</p>
                <p>I deem it of importance that the loyal regions of East Tennessee and western
                    North Carolina should be connected with Kentucky, and other faithful parts of
                    the Union, by railroad. I therefore recommend, as a military measure, that
                    Congress provide for the construction of such road, as speedily as possible.
                    Kentucky, no doubt, will co-operate, and, through her legislature, make the most
                    judicious selection of a line. The northern terminus must connect with some
                    existing railroad; and whether the route shall be from Lexington, or
                    Nicholasville, to the Cumberland Gap; or from Lebanon to the Tennessee line, in
                    the direction of Knoxville; or on some still <pb n="5" xml:id="pg_5" facs="0005"
                    /> different line, can easily be determined. Kentucky and the general government
                    co-operating, the work can be completed in a very short time; and when done, it
                    will be not only of vast present usefulness, but also a valuable permanent
                    improvement, worth its cost in all the future.</p>
                <p>Some treaties, designed chiefly for the interests of commerce, and having no
                    grave political importance, have been negotiated, and will be submitted to the
                    Senate for their consideration.</p>
                <p>Although we have failed to induce some of the commercial powers to adopt a
                    desirable melioration of the rigor of maritime war, we have removed all
                    obstructions from the way of this humane reform, except such as are merely of
                    temporary and accidental occurrence.</p>
                <p>I invite your attention to the correspondence between her Britannic Majesty’s
                    minister accredited to this government, and the Secretary of State, relative to
                    the detention of the British ship Perthshire in June last, by the United States
                    steamer Massachusetts, for a supposed breach of the blockade. As this detention
                    was occasioned by an obvious misapprehension of the facts, and as justice
                    requires that we should commit no belligerent act not founded in strict right,
                    as sanctioned by public law, I recommend that an appropriation be made to
                    satisfy the reasonable demand of the owners of the vessel for her detention.</p>
                <p>I repeat the recommendation of my predecessor, in his annual message to Congress
                    in December last, in regard to the disposition of the surplus which will
                    probably remain after satisfying the claims of American citizens against China,
                    pursuant to the awards of the commissioners under the act of the 3d of March,
                    1859. If, however, it should not be deemed advisable to carry that
                    recommendation into effect, I would suggest that authority be given for
                    investing the principal, over the proceeds of the surplus referred to in good
                    securities, with a view to the satisfaction of such other just claims of our
                    citizens against China as are not unlikely to arise hereafter in the course of
                    our extensive trade with that Empire.</p>
                <p>By the act of the 5th of August last, Congress authorized the President to
                    instruct the commanders of suitable vessels to defend themselves against, and to
                    capture pirates. This authority has been exercised in a single instance only.
                    For the more effectual protection of our extensive and valuable commerce, in the
                    eastern seas especially, it seems to me that it would also be advisable to
                    authorize <pb n="6" xml:id="pg_6" facs="0006"/> the commanders of sailing
                    vessels to re-capture any prizes which pirates may make of United States vessels
                    and their cargoes, and the consular courts, now established by law in eastern
                    countries, to adjudicate the cases, in the event that this should not be
                    objected to by the local authorities.</p>
                <p>If any good reason exists why we should persevere longer in withholding our
                    recognition of the independence and sovereignty of Hayti and Liberia, I am
                    unable to discern it. Unwilling, however, to inaugurate a novel policy in regard
                    to them without the approbation of Congress, I submit for your consideration the
                    expediency of an appropriation for maintaining a chargé d’affaires near each of
                    those new states. It does not admit of doubt that important commercial
                    advantages might be secured by favorable treaties with them.</p>
                <p>The operations of the treasury during the period which has elapsed since your
                    adjournment have been conducted with signal success. The patriotism of the
                    people has placed at the disposal of the government the large means demanded by
                    the public exigencies. Much of the national loan has been taken by citizens of
                    the industrial classes, whose confidence in their country’s faith, and zeal for
                    their country’s deliverance from present peril, have induced them to contribute
                    to the support of the government the whole of their limited acquisitions. This
                    fact imposes peculiar obligations to economy in disbursement and energy in
                    action.</p>
                <p>The revenue from all sources, including loans, for the financial year ending on
                    the 30th June, 1861, was eighty-six million eight hundred and thirty-five
                    thousand nine hundred dollars and twenty-seven cents, and the expenditures for
                    the same period, including payments on account of the public debt, were
                    eighty-four million five hundred and seventy-eight thousand eight hundred and
                    thirty-four dollars and forty-seven cents; leaving a balance in the treasury, on
                    the 1st July, of two million two hundred and fifty-seven thousand sixty-five
                    dollars and eighty cents. For the first quarter of the financial year, ending on
                    the 30th September, 1861, the receipts from all sources, including the balance
                    of 1st of July, were one hundred and two million five hundred and thirty-two
                    thousand five hundred and nine dollars and twenty-seven cents, and the expenses
                    ninety-eight million two hundred and thirty-nine thousand seven hundred and
                    thirty-three dollars and nine cents; leaving a balance, on the 1st of October,
                    1861, of four million two hundred and ninety-two thousand seven hundred and
                    seventy-six dollars and eighteen cents.</p>
                <pb n="7" xml:id="pg_7" facs="0007"/>
                <p>Estimates for the remaining three quarters of the year, and for the financial
                    year 1863, together with his views of ways and means for meeting the demands
                    contemplated by them, will be submitted to Congress by the Secretary of the
                    Treasury. It is gratifying to know that the expenditures made necessary by the
                    rebellion are not beyond the resources of the loyal people, and to believe that
                    the same patriotism which has thus far sustained the government will continue to
                    sustain it till Peace and Union shall again bless the land.</p>
                <p>I respectfully refer to the report of the Secretary of War for information
                    respecting the numerical strength of the army, and for recommendations having in
                    view an increase of its efficiency and the well being of the various branches of
                    the service intrusted to his care. It is gratifying to know that the patriotism
                    of the people has proved equal to the occasion, and that the number of troops
                    tendered greatly exceeds the force which Congress authorized me to call into the
                    field.</p>
                <p>I refer with pleasure to those portions of his report which make allusion to the
                    creditable degree of discipline already attained by our troops, and to the
                    excellent sanitary condition of the entire army.</p>
                <p>The recommendation of the Secretary for an organization of the militia upon a
                    uniform basis, is a subject of vital importance to the future safety of the
                    country, and is commended to the serious attention of Congress.</p>
                <p>The large addition to the regular army, in connexion with the defection that has
                    so considerably diminished the number of its officers, gives peculiar importance
                    to his recommendation for increasing the corps of cadets to the greatest
                    capacity of the Military Academy.</p>
                <p>By mere omission, I presume, Congress has failed to provide chaplains for
                    hospitals occupied by volunteers. This subject was brought to my notice, and I
                    was induced to draw up the form of a letter, one copy of which, properly
                    addressed, has been delivered to each of the persons, and at the dates
                    respectively named and stated, in a schedule, containing also the form of the
                    letter, marked A, and herewith transmitted.</p>
                <p>These gentlemen, I understand, entered upon the duties designated, at the times
                    respectively stated in the schedule, and have labored faithfully therein ever
                    since. I therefore recommend that they be compensated at the same rate as
                    chaplains in the army. I <pb n="8" xml:id="pg_8" facs="0008"/> further suggest
                    that general provision be made for chaplains to serve at hospitals, as well as
                    with regiments.</p>
                <p>The report of the Secretary of the Navy presents in detail the operations of that
                    branch of the service, the activity and energy which have characterized its
                    administration, and the results of measures to increase its efficiency and
                    power. Such have been the additions, by construction and purchase, that it may
                    almost be said a navy has been created and brought into service since our
                    difficulties commenced.</p>
                <p>Besides blockading our extensive coast, squadrons larger than ever before
                    assembled under our flag have been put afloat and performed deeds which have
                    increased our naval renown.</p>
                <p>I would invite special attention to the recommendation of the Secretary for a
                    more perfect organization of the navy by introducing additional grades in the
                    service.</p>
                <p>The present organization is defective and unsatisfactory, and the suggestions
                    submitted by the department will, it is believed, if adopted, obviate the
                    difficulties alluded to, promote harmony, and increase the efficiency of the
                    navy.</p>
                <p>There are three vacancies on the bench of the Supreme Court—two by the decease of
                    Justices Daniel and McLean, and one by the resignation of Justice Campbell. I
                    have so far forborne making nominations to fill these vacancies for reasons
                    which I will now state. Two of the outgoing judges resided within the States now
                    overrun by revolt; so that if successors were appointed in the same localities,
                    they could not now serve upon their circuits; and many of the most competent men
                    there, probably would not take the personal hazard of accepting to serve, even
                    here, upon the supreme bench. I have been unwilling to throw all the
                    appointments northward, thus disabling myself from doing justice to the south on
                    the return of peace; although I may remark that to transfer to the north one
                    which has heretofore been in the south, would not, with reference to territory
                    and population, be unjust.</p>
                <p>During the long and brilliant judicial career of Judge McLean his circuit grew
                    into an empire—altogether too large for any one judge to give the courts therein
                    more than a nominal attendance—rising in population from one million four
                    hundred and seventy thousand and eighteen, in 1830, to six million one hundred
                    and fifty-one thousand four hundred and five, in 1860.</p>
                <p>Besides this, the country generally has outgrown our present judicial <pb n="9"
                        xml:id="pg_9" facs="0009"/> system. If uniformity was at all intended, the
                    system requires that all the States shall be accommodated with circuit courts,
                    attended by supreme judges, while, in fact, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Kansas,
                    Florida, Texas, California, and Oregon have never had any such courts. Nor can
                    this well be remedied without a change of the system; because the adding of
                    judges to the Supreme Court, enough for the accommodation of all parts of the
                    country, with circuit courts, would create a court altogether too numerous for a
                    judicial body of any sort. And the evil, if it be one, will increase as new
                    States come into the Union. Circuit courts are useful, or they are not useful.
                    If useful, no State should be denied them; if not useful, no State should have
                    them. Let them be provided for all, or abolished as to all.</p>
                <p>Three modifications occur to me, either of which, I think, would be an
                    improvement upon our present system. Let the Supreme Court be of convenient
                    number in every event. Then, first, let the whole country be divided into
                    circuits of convenient size, the supreme judges to serve in a number of them
                    corresponding to their own number, and independent circuit judges be provided
                    for all the rest. Or, secondly, let the supreme judges be relieved from circuit
                    duties, and circuit judges provided for all the circuits. Or, thirdly, dispense
                    with circuit courts altogether, leaving the judicial functions wholly to the
                    district courts and an independent Supreme Court.</p>
                <p>I respectfully recommend to the consideration of Congress the present condition
                    of the statute laws, with the hope that Congress will be able to find an easy
                    remedy for many of the inconveniences and evils which constantly embarrass those
                    engaged in the practical administration of them. Since the organization of the
                    government, Congress has enacted some five thousand acts and joint resolutions,
                    which fill more than six thousand closely printed pages, and are scattered
                    through many volumes. Many of these acts have been drawn in haste and without
                    sufficient caution, so that their provisions are often obscure in themselves, or
                    in conflict with each other, or at least so doubtful as to render it very
                    difficult for even the best informed persons to ascertain precisely what the
                    statute law really is.</p>
                <p>It seems to me very important that the statute laws should be made as plain and
                    intelligible as possible, and be reduced to as small a compass as may consist
                    with the fullness and precision of the will of the legislature and the
                    perspicuity of its language. This, well done, would, I think, greatly facilitate
                    the labors of those whose duty it is to assist in the administration of the
                    laws, and would be a <pb n="10" xml:id="pg_10" facs="0010"/> lasting benefit to
                    the people, by placing before them, in a more accessible and intelligible form,
                    the laws which so deeply concern their interests and their duties.</p>
                <p>I am informed by some whose opinions I respect, that all the acts of Congress now
                    in force, and of a permanent and general nature, might be revised and
                    re-written, so as to be embraced in one volume (or at most, two volumes) of
                    ordinary and convenient size. And I respectfully recommend to Congress to
                    consider of the subject, and, if my suggestion be approved, to devise such plan
                    as to their wisdom shall seem most proper for the attainment of the end
                    proposed.</p>
                <p>One of the unavoidable consequences of the present insurrection is the entire
                    suppression, in many places, of all the ordinary means of administering civil
                    justice by the officers, and in the forms of existing law. This is the case, in
                    whole or in part, in all the insurgent States; and as our armies advance upon
                    and take possession of parts of those States, the practical evil becomes more
                    apparent. There are no courts nor officers to whom the citizens of other States
                    may apply for the enforcement of their lawful claims against citizens of the
                    insurgent States; and there is a vast amount of debt constituting such claims.
                    Some have estimated it as high as two hundred million dollars, due, in large
                    part, from insurgents, in open rebellion, to loyal citizens who are, even now,
                    making great sacrifices in the discharge of their patriotic duty to support the
                    government.</p>
                <p>Under these circumstances, I have been urgently solicited to establish, by
                    military power, courts to administer summary justice in such cases. I have thus
                    far declined to do it, not because I had any doubt that the end proposed—the
                    collection of the debts—was just and right in itself, but because I have been
                    unwilling to go beyond the pressure of necessity in the unusual exercise of
                    power. But the powers of Congress I suppose are equal to the anomalous occasion,
                    and therefore I refer the whole matter to Congress, with the hope that a plan
                    may be devised for the administration of justice in all such parts of the
                    insurgent States and Territories as may be under the control of this government,
                    whether by a voluntary return to allegiance and order, or by the power of our
                    arms. This, however, not to be a permanent institution, but a temporary
                    substitute, and to cease as soon as the ordinary courts can be re-established in
                    peace.</p>
                <p>It is important that some more convenient means should be provided, if possible,
                    for the adjustment of claims against the government, especially in view of their
                    increased number by reason of the <pb n="11" xml:id="pg_11" facs="0011"/> war.
                    It is as much the duty of government to render prompt justice against itself, in
                    favor of citizens, as it is to administer the same, between private individuals.
                    The investigation and adjudication of claims, in their nature belong to the
                    judicial department; besides it is apparent that the attention of Congress, will
                    be more than usually engaged, for some time to come, with great national
                    questions. It was intended, by the organization of the court of claims, mainly
                    to remove this branch of business from the halls of Congress; but while the
                    court has proved to be an effective, and valuable means of investigation, it in
                    great degree fails to effect the object of its creation, for want of power to
                    make its judgments final.</p>
                <p>Fully aware of the delicacy, not to say the danger, of the subject, I commend to
                    your careful consideration whether this power of making judgments final, may not
                    properly be given to the court, reserving the right of appeal on questions of
                    law to the Supreme Court, with such other provisions as experience may have
                    shown to be necessary.</p>
                <p>I ask attention to the report of the Postmaster General, the following being a
                    summary statement of the condition of the department:</p>
                <p>The revenue from all sources during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1861,
                    including the annual permanent appropriation of seven hundred thousand dollars
                    for the transportation of “free mail matter,” was nine million forty-nine
                    thousand two hundred, and ninety-six dollars and forty cents, being about two
                    per cent, less than the revenue for 1860.</p>
                <p>The expenditures were thirteen million six hundred and six thousand seven hundred
                    and fifty-nine dollars and eleven cents, showing a decrease of more than eight
                    per cent, as compared with those of the previous year, and leaving an excess of
                    expenditure over the revenue for the last fiscal year of four million five
                    hundred and fifty-seven thousand four hundred and sixty-two dollars and
                    seventy-one cents.</p>
                <p>The gross revenue for the year ending June 30, 1863, is estimated at an increase
                    of four per cent, on that of 1861, making eight million six hundred and
                    eighty-three thousand dollars, to which should be added the earnings of the
                    department in carrying free matter, viz: seven hundred thousand dollars, making
                    nine million three hundred and eighty-three thousand dollars.</p>
                <p>The total expenditures for 1863 are estimated at twelve million five hundred and
                    twenty-eight thousand dollars, leaving an estimated <pb n="12" xml:id="pg_12"
                        facs="0012"/> deficiency of three million one hundred and forty-five
                    thousand dollars to be supplied from the treasury, in addition to the permanent
                    appropriation.</p>
                <p>The present insurrection shows, I think, that the extension of this District
                    across the Potomac river, at the time of establishing the capital here, was
                    eminently wise, and consequently that the relinquishment of that portion of it
                    which lies within the State of Virginia was unwise and dangerous. I submit for
                    your consideration the expediency of regaining that part of the District, and
                    the restoration of the original boundaries thereof, through negotiations with
                    the State of Virginia.</p>
                <p>The report of the Secretary of the Interior, with the accompanying documents,
                    exhibits the condition of the several branches of the public business pertaining
                    to that department. The depressing influences of the insurrection have been
                    especially felt in the operations of the Patent and General Land Offices. The
                    cash receipts from the sales of public lands during the past year have exceeded
                    the expenses of our land system only about two hundred thousand dollars. The
                    sales have been entirely suspended in the southern States, while the
                    interruptions to the business of the country, and the diversion of large numbers
                    of men from labor to military service, have obstructed settlements in the new
                    States and Territories of the northwest.</p>
                <p>The receipts of the Patent Office have declined in nine months about one hundred
                    thousand dollars, rendering a large reduction of the force employed necessary to
                    make it self-sustaining.</p>
                <p>The demands upon the Pension Office will be largely increased by the
                    insurrection. Numerous applications for pensions, based upon the casualties of
                    the existing war, have already been made. There is reason to believe that many
                    who are now upon the pension rolls and in receipt of the bounty of the
                    government, are in the ranks of the insurgent army, or giving them aid and
                    comfort. The Secretary of the Interior has directed a suspension of the payment
                    of the pensions of such persons upon proof of their disloyalty. I recommend that
                    Congress authorize that officer to cause the names of such persons to be
                    stricken from the pension rolls.</p>
                <p>The relations of the government with the Indian tribes have been greatly
                    disturbed by the insurrection, especially in the southern super-intendency and
                    in that of New Mexico. The Indian country south of Kansas is in the possession
                    of insurgents from Texas and Arkansas. The <pb n="13" xml:id="pg_13" facs="0013"
                    /> agents of the United States appointed since the 4th of March for this
                    superintendency have been unable to reach their posts, while the most of those
                    who were in office before that time have espoused the insurrectionary cause, and
                    assume to exercise the powers of agents by virtue of commissions from the
                    insurrectionists. It has been stated in the public press that a portion of those
                    Indians have been organized as a military force, and are attached to the army of
                    the insurgents. Although the government has no official information upon this
                    subject, letters have been written to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs by
                    several prominent chiefs, giving assurance of their loyalty to the United
                    States, and expressing a wish for the presence of federal troops to protect
                    them. It is believed that upon the repossession of the country by the federal
                    forces the Indians will readily cease all hostile demonstrations, and resume
                    their former relations to the government.</p>
                <p>Agriculture, confessedly the largest interest of the nation, has, not a
                    department, nor a bureau, but a clerkship only, assigned to it in the
                    government. While it is fortunate that this great interest is so independent in
                    its nature as to not have demanded and extorted more from the government, I
                    respectfully ask Congress to consider whether something more cannot be given
                    voluntarily with general advantage.</p>
                <p>Annual reports exhibiting the condition of our agriculture, commerce and
                    manufactures would present a fund of information of great practical value to the
                    country. While I make no suggestion as to details, I venture the opinion that an
                    agricultural and statistical bureau might profitably be organized.</p>
                <p>The execution of the laws for the suppression of the African slave trade has been
                    confided to the Department of the Interior. It is a subject of gratulation that
                    the efforts which have been made for the suppression of this inhuman traffic
                    have been recently attended with unusual success. Five vessels being fitted out
                    for the slave trade have been seized and condemned. Two mates of vessels engaged
                    in the trade, and one person in equipping a vessel as a slaver, have been
                    convicted and subjected to the penalty of fine and imprisonment, and one
                    captain, taken with a cargo of Africans on board his vessel, has been convicted
                    of the highest grade of offence under our laws, the punishment of which is
                    death.</p>
                <p>The Territories of Colorado, Dakotah and Nevada, created by the <pb n="14"
                        xml:id="pg_14" facs="0014"/> last Congress, have been organized, and civil
                    administration has been inaugurated therein under auspices especially
                    gratifying, when it is considered that the leaven of treason was found existing
                    in some of these new countries when the federal officers arrived there.</p>
                <p>The abundant natural resources of these Territories, with the security and
                    protection afforded by organized government, will doubtless invite to them a
                    large immigration when peace shall restore the business of the country to its
                    accustomed channels. I submit the resolutions of the legislature of Colorado,
                    which evidence the patriotic spirit of the people of the Territory. So far the
                    authority of the United States has been upheld in all the Territories, as it is
                    hoped it will be in the future. I commend their interests and defence to the
                    enlightened and generous care of Congress.</p>
                <p>I recommend to the favorable consideration of Congress the interests of the
                    District of Columbia. The insurrection has been the cause of much suffering and
                    sacrifice to its inhabitants, and as they have no representative in Congress,
                    that body should not overlook their just claims upon the government.</p>
                <p>At your late session a joint resolution was adopted authorizing the President to
                    take measures for facilitating a proper representation of the industrial
                    interests of the United States at the exhibition of the industry of all nations
                    to be holden at London in the year 1862. I regret to say I have been unable to
                    give personal attention to this subject—a subject at once so interesting in
                    itself, and so extensively and intimately connected with the material prosperity
                    of the world. Through the Secretaries of State and of the Interior a plan, or
                    system, has been devised, and partly matured, and which will be laid before
                    you.</p>
                <p>Under and by virtue of the act of Congress entitled “An act to confiscate
                    property used for insurrectionary purposes,” approved August 6, 1861, the legal
                    claims of certain persons to the labor and service of certain other persons have
                    become forfeited; and numbers of the latter, thus liberated, are already
                    dependent on the United States, and must be provided for in some way. Besides
                    this, it is not impossible that some of the States will pass similar enactments
                    for their own benefit respectively, and by operation of which, persons of the
                    same class will be thrown upon them for disposal. In such case I recommend that
                    Congress provide for accepting such persons from such States, according to some
                    mode of valuation, in lieu, <hi rend="italic">pro tanto</hi>, of direct taxes,
                    or upon some other plan to be agreed on with <pb n="15" xml:id="pg_15"
                        facs="0015"/> such States respectively; that such persons, on such
                    acceptance by the general government, be at once deemed free; and that, in any
                    event, steps be taken for colonizing both classes, (or the one first mentioned,
                    if the other shall not be brought into existence,) at some place, or places, in
                    a climate “congenial to them. It might be well to consider, too, whether the
                    free colored people already in the United States could not, so far as
                    individuals may desire, be included in such colonization.</p>
                <p>To carry out the plan of colonization may involve the acquiring of territory, and
                    also the appropriation of money beyond that to be expended in the territorial
                    acquisition. Having practiced the acquisition of territory for nearly sixty
                    years, the question of constitutional power to do so is no longer an open one
                    with us. The power was questioned at first by Mr. Jefferson, who, however, in
                    the purchase of Louisiana, yielded his scruples on the plea of great expediency.
                    If it be said that the only legitimate object of acquiring territory is to
                    furnish homes for white men, this measure effects that object; for the
                    emigration of colored men leaves additional room for white men remaining or
                    coming here. Mr. Jefferson, however, placed the importance of procuring
                    Louisiana more on political and commercial grounds than on providing room for
                    population.</p>
                <p>On this whole proposition, including the appropriation of money with the
                    acquisition of territory, does not the expediency amount to absolute
                    necessity—that, without which the government itself cannot be perpetuated?</p>
                <p>The war continues. In considering the policy to be adopted for suppressing the
                    insurrection, I have been anxious and careful that the inevitable conflict for
                    this purpose shall not degenerate into a violent and remorseless revolutionary
                    struggle. I have, therefore, in every case, thought it proper to keep the
                    integrity of the Union prominent as the primary object of the contest on our
                    part, leaving all questions which are not of vital military importance to the
                    more deliberate action of the legislature.</p>
                <p>In the exercise of my best discretion I have adhered to the blockade of the ports
                    held by the insurgents, instead of putting in force, by proclamation, the law of
                    Congress enacted at the late session for closing those ports.</p>
                <p>So, also, obeying the dictates of prudence, as well as the obligations of law,
                    instead of transcending, I have adhered to the act of <pb n="16" xml:id="pg_16"
                        facs="0016"/> Congress to confiscate property used for insurrectionary
                    purposes. If a new law upon the same subject shall be proposed, its propriety
                    will be duly considered. The Union must be preserved; and hence, all
                    indispensable means must be employed. We should not be in haste to determine
                    that radical, and extreme measures, which may reach the loyal as well as the
                    disloyal, are indispensable.</p>
                <p>The inaugural address at the beginning of the Administration, and the message to
                    Congress at the late special session, were both mainly devoted to the domestic
                    controversy out of which the insurrection and consequent war have sprung.
                    Nothing now occurs to add or subtract, to or from, the principles, or general
                    purposes, stated and expressed, in those documents.</p>
                <p>The last ray of hope for preserving the Union peaceably, expired at the assault
                    upon Fort Sumter; and a general review of what has occurred since may not be
                    unprofitable. What was painfully uncertain then, is much better defined and more
                    distinct now; and the progress of events is plainly in the right direction. The
                    insurgents confidently claimed a strong support from north of Mason and Dixon’s
                    line; and the friends of the Union were not free from apprehension on the point.
                    This, however, was soon settled definitely, and on the right side. South of the
                    line, noble little Delaware led off right from the first. Maryland was made to
                        <hi rend="italic">seem</hi> against the Union. Our soldiers were assaulted,
                    bridges were burned, and railroads torn up, within her limits; and we were many
                    days, at one time, without the ability to bring a single regiment over her soil
                    to the capital. Now, her bridges and railroads are repaired and open to the
                    government; she already gives seven regiments to the cause of the Union and none
                    to the enemy; and her people, at a regular election, have sustained the Union,
                    by a larger majority? and a larger aggregate vote than they ever before gave to
                    any candidate, or any question. Kentucky, too, for some time in doubt, is now
                    decidedly, and, I think, unchangeably, ranged on the side of the Union. Missouri
                    is comparatively quiet; and I believe cannot again be overrun by the
                    insurrectionists. These three States of Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri,
                    neither of which would promise a single soldier at first, have now an aggregate
                    of not less than forty thousand in the field, for the Union; while, of their
                    citizens, certainly not more than a third of that number, and they of doubtful
                    whereabouts, and doubtful existence, are in arms against it. After a somewhat
                        <pb n="17" xml:id="pg_17" facs="0017"/> bloody struggle of months, winter
                    closes on the Union people of western Virginia, leaving them masters of their
                    own country.</p>
                <p>An insurgent force of about fifteen hundred, for months dominating the narrow
                    peninsular region, constituting the counties of Accomac and Northampton, and
                    known as eastern shore of Virginia, together with some contiguous, parts of
                    Maryland, have laid down their arms; and the people there have renewed their
                    allegiance to, and accepted the protection of, the old flag. This leaves no
                    armed insurrectionist north of the Potomac, or east of the Chesapeake.</p>
                <p>Also we have obtained a footing at each of the isolated points, on the southern
                    coast, of Hatteras, Port Royal, Tybee Island, near Savannah, and Ship island;
                    and we likewise have some general accounts of popular movements, in behalf of
                    the Union, in North Carolina and Tennessee.</p>
                <p>These things demonstrate that the cause of the Union is advancing steadily and
                    certainly southward.</p>
                <p>Since your last adjournment, Lieutenant General Scott has retired from the head
                    of the army. During his long life, the nation has not been unmindful of his
                    merit; yet, on calling to mind how faithfully, ably, and brilliantly he has
                    served the country, from a time far back in our history, when few of the now
                    living had been born, and thenceforward continually, I cannot but think we are
                    still his debtors. I submit, therefore, for your consideration, what further
                    mark of recognition is due to him, and to ourselves, as a grateful people.</p>
                <p>With the retirement of General Scott came the executive duty of appointing, in
                    his stead, a general-in-chief of the army. It is a fortunate circumstance that
                    neither in council nor country was there, so far as I know, any difference of
                    opinion as to the proper person to be selected. The retiring chief repeatedly
                    expressed his judgment in favor of General McClellan for the position; and in
                    this the nation seemed to give a unanimous concurrence. The designation of
                    General McClellan is, therefore, in considerable degree, the selection of the
                    country, as well as of the Executive; and hence there is better reason to hope
                    there will be given him, the confidence, and cordial support thus, by fair
                    implication, promised, and without which, he cannot, with so full efficiency,
                    serve the country.</p>
                <p>It has been said that one bad general is better than two good ones; and the
                    saying is true, if taken to mean no more than that an army <pb n="18"
                        xml:id="pg_18" facs="0018"/> is better directed by a single mind, though
                    inferior, than by two superior ones, at variance, and cross-purposes with each
                    other.</p>
                <p>And the same is true, in all joint operations wherein those engaged, <hi
                        rend="italic">can</hi> have none but a common end in view, and <hi
                        rend="italic">can</hi> differ only as to the choice of means. In a storm at
                    sea, no one on board <hi rend="italic">can</hi> wish the ship to sink; and yet,
                    not unfrequently, all go down together, because too many will direct, and no
                    single mind can be allowed to control.</p>
                <p>It continues to develop that the insurrection is largely, if not exclusively, a
                    war upon the first principle of popular government—the rights of the people.
                    Conclusive evidence of this is found in the most grave and maturely considered
                    public documents, as well as in the general tone of the insurgents. In those
                    documents we find the abridgment of the existing right of suffrage, and the
                    denial to the people of all right to participate in the selection of public
                    officers, except the legislative, boldly advocated, with labored arguments to
                    prove that large control of the people in government, is the source of all
                    political evil. Monarchy itself is sometimes hinted at as a possible refuge from
                    the power of the people.</p>
                <p>In my present position, I could scarcely be justified were I to omit raising a
                    warning voice against this approach of returning despotism.</p>
                <p>It is not needed, nor fitting here, that a general argument should be made in
                    favor of popular institutions; but there is one point, with its connexions, not
                    so hackneyed as most others, to which I ask a brief attention. It is the effort
                    to place <hi rend="italic">capital</hi> on an equal footing with, if not above
                        <hi rend="italic">labor</hi>, in the structure of government. It is assumed
                    that labor is available only in connexion with capital; that nobody labors
                    unless somebody else, owning capital, somehow by the use of it, induces him to
                    labor. This assumed, it is next considered whether it is best that capital shall
                        <hi rend="italic">hire</hi> laborers, and thus induce them to work by their
                    own consent, or <hi rend="italic">buy</hi> them, and drive them to it without
                    their consent. Having proceded so far, it is naturally concluded that all
                    laborers are either <hi rend="italic">hired</hi> laborers, or what we call
                    slaves. And further, it is assumed that whoever is once a hired laborer, is
                    fixed in that condition for life.</p>
                <p>Now, there is no such relation between capital and labor a assumed; nor is there
                    any such thing as a free man being fixed for <pb n="19" xml:id="pg_19"
                        facs="0019"/> life in the condition of a hired laborer. Both these
                    assumptions are false, and all inferences from them are groundless.</p>
                <p>Labor is prior to, and independent of, capital. Capital is only the fruit of
                    labor, and could never have existed if labor had not first existed. Labor is the
                    superior of capital, and deserves much the higher consideration. Capital has its
                    rights, which are as worthy of protection as any other rights. Nor is it denied
                    that there is, and probably always will be, a relation between labor and
                    capital, producing mutual benefits. The error is in assuming that the whole
                    labor of community exists within that relation. A few men own capital, and that
                    few avoid labor themselves, and, with their capital, hire or buy another few to
                    labor for them. A large majority belong to neither class—neither work for
                    others, nor have others working for them. In most of the southern States, a
                    majority of the whole people of all colors, are neither slaves nor masters;
                    while in the northern, a large majority are neither hirers nor hired. Men with
                    their families—wives, sons, and daughters—work for themselves, on their farms,
                    in their houses, and in their shops taking the whole product to themselves, and
                    asking no favors of capital on the one hand, nor of hired laborers or slaves on
                    the other. It is not forgotten that a considerable number of persons mingle
                    their own labor with capital—that is, they labor with their own hands, and also
                    buy or hire others to labor for them; but this is only a mixed, and not a
                    distinct class. No principle stated is disturbed by the existence of this mixed
                    class.</p>
                <p>Again: as has already been said, there is not, of necessity, any such thing as
                    the free hired laborer being fixed to that condition for life. Many independent
                    men everywhere in these States, a few years back in their lives, were hired
                    laborers. The prudent, penniless beginner in the world, labors for wages awhile,
                    saves a surplus with which to buy tools or land for himself; then labors on his
                    own account another while, and at length hires another new beginner to help him.
                    This is the just, and generous, and prosperous system, which opens; the way to
                    all—gives hope to all, and consequent energy, and progress, and improvement of
                    condition to all. No men living are more worthy to be trusted than those who
                    toil up from poverty—none less inclined to take, or touch, aught which they have
                    not honestly earned. Let them beware of surrendering a political power which <pb
                        n="20" xml:id="pg_20" facs="0020"/> they already possess, and which, if
                    surrendered, will surely be used to close the door of advancement against such
                    as they, and to fix new disabilities and burdens upon them, till all of liberty
                    shall be lost.</p>
                <p>From the first taking of our National Census to the last, are seventy years; and
                    we find our population, at the end of the period, eight times as great as it was
                    at the beginning. The increase of those other things, which men deem desirable,
                    has been even greater. We thus have, at one view, what the popular principle,
                    applied to government, though the machinery of the States and the Union, has
                    produced in a given time; and also what, if firmly maintained, it promises for
                    the future. There are already among us those who, if the Union be preserved,
                    will live to see it contain two hundred and fifty millions. The struggle <hi
                        rend="italic">of</hi> to-day is not altogether <hi rend="italic">for</hi>
                    to-day—it is for a vast future also. With a reliance on Providence, all the more
                    firm and earnest, let us proceed in the great task which events have devolved
                    upon us.</p>

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Having been solicited by Christian ministers, and
                    other pious people, to appoint suitable persons to act as chaplains at the
                    hospitals for our sick and wounded soldiers, and feeling the intrinsic propriety
                    of having such persons to so act, and yet believing there is no law conferring
                    the power upon me to appoint them, I think fit to say that if you will
                    voluntarily enter upon and perform the appropriate duties of such position, I
                    will recommend that Congress make compensation therefor at the same rate as
                    chaplains in the army are compensated.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: You are, of course, aware that the
                            election of last November resulted in the choice of Mr. Abraham Lincoln;
                            that he was the candidate of the republican or anti-slavery party; that
                            the preceding discussion had been confined almost entirely to topics
                            connected, directly or indirectly, with the subject of negro slavery;
                            that every northern State cast its whole electoral vote (except three in
                            New Jersey) for Mr. Lincoln, while in the whole south the popular
                            sentiment against him was almost absolutely universal. Some of the
                            southern States, immediately after the election, took measures for
                            separating themselves from the Union, and others soon followed their
                            example. Conventions have been called in South Carolina, Georgia,
                            Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas, and those
                            conventions, in all except the last-named State, have passed ordinances
                            declaring their secession from the federal government. A congress,
                            composed of representatives from the six first-named States, has been
                            assembled for some time at Montgomery, Alabama. By this body a
                            provisional constitution has been framed for what it styles the
                            “Confederated States of America.”</p>
                        <p>It is not improbable that persons claiming to represent the States which
                            have thus attempted to throw off their federal obligations will seek a
                            recognition of their independence by the Emperor of Russia. In the event
                            of such an effort being made, you are expected by the President to use
                            such means as may in your judgment be proper and necessary to prevent
                            its success.</p>
                        <p>The reasons set forth in the President’s message at the opening of the
                            present session of Congress, in support of his opinion that the States
                            have no constitutional power to secede from the Union, are still
                            unanswered, and are believed to be unanswerable. The grounds upon which
                            they have attempted to justify the revolutionary act of severing the
                            bonds which connect them with their sister States are regarded as wholly
                            insufficient. This government has not relinquished its constitutional
                            jurisdiction within the territory of those States, and does not desire
                            to do so.</p>
                        <p>It must be very evident that it is the right of this government to ask of
                            all foreign powers that the latter shall take no steps which may tend to
                            encourage the revolutionary movement of the seceding States, or increase
                            the danger of disaffection in those which still remain loyal. The
                            President feels assured that the government of the Emperor will not do
                            anything in these affairs inconsistent with the friendship which this
                            government has always heretofore experienced from him and his ancestors.
                            If the independence of the “Confederated States” should be acknowledged
                            by the great powers of Europe it would tend to disturb the friendly
                            relations, diplomatic and commercial, now existing between those powers
                            and the United <pb n="32" xml:id="pg_32" facs="0032"/> States. All these
                            are consequences which the court of the Emperor will not fail to see are
                            adverse to the interests of Russia as well as to those of this
                            country.</p>
                        <p>Your particular knowledge of our political institutions will enable you
                            to explain satisfactorily the causes of our present domestic troubles,
                            and the grounds of the hope still entertained that entire harmony will
                            soon be restored.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: My predecessor, in his despatch, number
                            10, addressed to you on the 28th of February last, instructed you to use
                            all proper and necessary measures to prevent the success of efforts
                            which may be made by persons claiming to represent those States of this
                            Union in whose name a provisional government has been announced to
                            procure a recognition of their independence by the government of
                            Spain.</p>
                        <p>I am now instructed by the President of the United States to inform you
                            that, having assumed the administration of the government in pursuance
                            of an unquestioned election and of the directions of the Constitution,
                            he renews the injunction which I have mentioned, and relies upon the
                            exercise of the greatest possible diligence and fidelity on your part to
                            counteract and prevent the designs of those who would invoke foreign
                            intervention to embarrass or overthrow the republic.</p>
                        <p>When you reflect on the novelty of such designs, their unpatriotic and
                            revolutionary character, and the long train of evils which must follow
                            directly or consequentially from even their partial or temporary
                            success, the President feels assured that you will justly appreciate and
                            cordially approve the caution which prompts this communication.</p>
                        <p>I transmit herewith a copy of the address pronounced by the President on
                            taking the constitutional oath of office. It sets forth clearly the
                            errors of the misguided partisans who are seeking to dismember the
                            Union, the grounds on which the conduct of those partisans is
                            disallowed, and also the general policy which the government will pursue
                            with a view to the preservation of domestic peace and order, and the
                            maintenance and preservation of the federal Union.</p>
                        <p>You will lose no time in submitting this address to the Spanish minister
                            for foreign affairs, and in assuring him that the President of the
                            United States entertains a full confidence in the speedy restoration of
                            the harmony and unity of the government by a firm, yet just and liberal
                            bearing, cooperating with the deliberate and loyal action of the
                            American people.</p>
                        <p>You will truthfully urge upon the Spanish government the consideration
                                <pb n="33" xml:id="pg_33" facs="0033"/> that the present
                            disturbances have had their origin only in popular passions, excited
                            under novel circumstances of very transient character, and that while
                            not one person of well-balanced mind has attempted to show that
                            dismemberment of the Union would be permanently conducive to the safety
                            and welfare of even his own State or section, much less of all the
                            States and sections of our country, the people themselves still retain
                            and cherish a profound confidence in our happy Constitution, together
                            with a veneration and affection for it such as no other form of
                            government ever received at the hands of those for whom it was
                            established.</p>
                        <p>We feel free to assume that it is the general conviction of men, not only
                            here but in all other countries, that this federal Union affords a
                            better system than any other that could be contrived to assure the
                            safety, the peace, the prosperity, the welfare, and the happiness of all
                            the States of which it is composed. The position of these States, and
                            their mining, agricultural, manufacturing, commercial, political, and
                            social relations and influences, seem to make it permanently the
                            interest of all other nations that our present political system shall be
                            unchanged and undisturbed. Any advantage that any foreign nation might
                            derive from a connation that it might form with any dissatisfied or
                            discontented portion, State, or section, even if not altogether
                            illusory, would be ephemeral, and would be overbalanced by the evils it
                            would suffer from a disseverance of the whole Union, whose manifest
                            policy it must be hereafter, as it has always been heretofore, to
                            maintain peace, liberal commerce, and cordial amity with all other
                            nations, and to favor the establishment of well-ordered government over
                            the whole American continent.</p>
                        <p>Nor do we think we exaggerate our national importance when we claim that
                            any political disaster that should befall us, and introduce discord or
                            anarchy among the States that have so long constituted one great
                            pacific, prosperous nation, under a form of government which has
                            approved itself to the respect and confidence of mankind, might tend by
                            its influence to disturb and unsettle the existing systems of government
                            in other parts of the world, and arrest that progress of improvement and
                            civilization which marks the era in which we live.</p>
                        <p>The United States have had too many assurances and manifestations of the
                            friendship and good will of her Catholic Majesty to entertain any doubt
                            that these considerations, and such others as your own large experience
                            of the working of our federal system will suggest, will have their just
                            influence with her, and will prevent her Majesty’s government from
                            yielding to solicitations to intervene in any unfriendly way in the
                            domestic concerns of our country. The President regrets that the events
                            going on here may be productive of some possible inconvenience to the
                            people and subjects of Spain; but he is determined that those
                            inconveniences shall be made as light and as transient as possible, and,
                            so far as it may rest with him, that all strangers who may suffer any
                            injury from them shall be amply indemnified. The President expects that
                            you will be prompt in transmitting to this department any information
                            you may receive on the subject of the attempts which have suggested this
                            communication.</p>
                        <p>I am, sir, respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The advocates of benevolence and the
                            believers in human progress, encouraged by the slow though marked
                            meliorations of the barbarities of war which have obtained in modern
                            times, have been, as you are well aware, recently engaged with much
                            assiduity in endeavoring to effect some modifications of the law of
                            nations in regard to the rights of neutrals in maritime war. In the
                            spirit of these movements the President of the United States, in the
                            year 1854, submitted to the several maritime nations two propositions,
                            to which he solicited their assent as permanent principles of
                            international law, which were as follows: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>Free ships make free goods; that is to say, that the effects
                                    or goods belonging to subjects or citizens of a power or State
                                    at war are free from capture or confiscation when found on board
                                    of neutral vessels, with the exception of articles contraband of
                                    war.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>That the property of neutrals on board an enemy’s vessel is
                                    not subject to confiscation unless the same be contraband of
                                    war.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>Several of the governments to which these propositions were submitted
                            expressed their willingness to accept them, while some others, which
                            were in a state of war, intimated a desire to defer acting thereon until
                            the return of peace should present what they thought would be a more
                            auspicious season for such interesting negotiations.</p>
                        <p>On the 16th of April, 1856, a congress was in session at Paris. It
                            consisted of several maritime powers, represented by their
                            plenipotentiaries, namely, Great Britain, Austria, France, Russia,
                            Prussia, Sardinia, and Turkey. That congress having taken up the general
                            subject to which allusion has already been made in this letter, on the
                            day before mentioned, came to an agreement, which they adopted in the
                            form of a declaration, to the effect following, namely: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>Privateering is and remains abolished.</item>

                                <item>The neutral flag covers enemy’s goods, with the exception of
                                    contraband of war.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>Neutral goods, with the exception of contraband of war, are
                                    not liable to capture under enemy’s flag.</item>
                                <label>4.</label>
                                <item>Blockades, in order to be binding, must be effective; that is
                                    to say, maintained by forces sufficient really to prevent access
                                    to the coast of the enemy.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>The agreement pledged the parties constituting the congress to bring the
                            declaration thus made to the knowledge of the States which had not been
                            represented in that body, and to invite them to accede to it. The
                            congress, however, at the same time insisted, in the first place, that
                            the declaration should be binding only on the powers who were or should
                            become parties to it as one whole and indivisible compact; and,
                            secondly, that the parties who had agreed, and those who should
                            afterwards accede to it, should, after the adoption of the same, enter
                            into no arrangement on the application of maritime law in time of war
                            without stipulating for a strict observance of the four points resolved
                            by the declaration.</p>
                        <p>The declaration which I have thus substantially recited of course
                            prevented all the powers which became parties to it from accepting the
                            two propositions which had been before submitted to the maritime nations
                            by the President of the United States.</p>
                        <p>The declaration was, in due time, submitted by the governments
                            represented in the congress at Paris to the government of the United
                            States.</p>
                        <pb n="35" xml:id="pg_35" facs="0035"/>
                        <p>The President, about the 14th of July, 1856, made known to the States
                            concerned his unwillingness to accede to the declaration. In making that
                            announcement on behalf of this government, my predecessor, Mr. Marcy,
                            called the attention of those States to the following points, namely: <list>
                                <item>1st. That the second and third propositions contained in the
                                    Paris declaration are substantially the same with the two
                                    propositions which had before been submitted to the maritime
                                    States by the President.</item>
                                <item>2d. That the Paris declaration, with the conditions annexed,
                                    was inadmissible by the United States in three respects, namely:
                                    1st. That the government of the United States could not give its
                                    assent to the first proposition contained in the declaration,
                                    namely, that “Privateering is and remains abolished,” although
                                    it was willing to accept it with an amendment which should
                                    exempt the private property of individuals, though belonging to
                                    belligerent States, from seizure or confiscation by national
                                    vessels in maritime war. 2d. That for this reason the
                                    stipulation annexed to the declaration, viz: that the
                                    propositions must be taken altogether or rejected altogether,
                                    without modification, could not be allowed. 3d. That the fourth
                                    condition annexed to the declaration, which provided that the
                                    parties acceding to it should enter into no negotiation for any
                                    modifications of the law of maritime war with nations which
                                    should not contain the four points contained in the Paris
                                    declaration, seemed inconsistent with a proper regard to the
                                    national sovereignty of the United States.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>On the 29th of July, 1856, Mr. Mason, then minister of the United States
                            at Paris, was instructed by the President to propose to the government
                            of France to enter into an arrangement for its adherence, with the
                            United States, to the four principles of the declaration of the congress
                            of Paris, provided the first of them should be amended as specified in
                            Mr. Marcy’s note to the Count de Sartiges on the 28th of July, 1856. Mr.
                            Mason accordingly brought the subject to the notice of the imperial
                            government of France, which was disposed to entertain the matter
                            favorably, but which failed to communicate its decision on the subject
                            to him. Similar instructions regarding the matter were addressed by this
                            department to Mr. Dallas, our minister at London, on the 31st day of
                            January, 1857; but the proposition above referred to had not been
                            directly presented to the British government by him when the
                            administration of this government by Franklin Pierce, during whose term
                            these proceedings occurred, came to an end, on the 3d of March, 1857,
                            and was succeeded by that of James Buchanan, who directed the
                            negotiations to be arrested for the purpose of enabling him to examine
                            the questions involved, and they have ever since remained in that state
                            of suspension.</p>
                        <p>The President of the United States has now taken the subject into
                            consideration, and he is prepared to communicate his views upon it, with
                            a disposition to bring the negotiation to a speedy and satisfactory
                            conclusion.</p>
                        <p>For that purpose you are hereby instructed to seek an early opportunity
                            to call the attention of her Majesty’s government to the subject, and to
                            ascertain whether it is disposed to enter into negotiations for the
                            accession of the government of the United States to the declaration of
                            the Paris congress, with the conditions annexed by that body to the
                            same; and if you shall find that government so disposed, you will then
                            enter into a convention to that effect, substantially in the form of a
                            project for that purpose herewith transmitted to you; the convention to
                            take effect from the time when the due ratifications of the same shall
                            have been exchanged. It is presumed that you will need no special
                            explanation of the sentiments of the President on this subject for the
                            purpose of conducting the necessary conferences with the government to
                            which you are accredited. Its assent is expected on the ground that the
                            proposition is accepted at its suggestion, and in the form it has <pb
                                n="36" xml:id="pg_36" facs="0036"/> preferred. For your own
                            information it will be sufficient to say that the President adheres to
                            the opinion expressed by my predecessor, Mr. Marcy, that it would be
                            eminently desirable for the good of all nations that the property and
                            effects of private individuals, not contraband, should be exempt from
                            seizure and confiscation by national vessels in maritime war. If the
                            time and circumstances were propitious to a prosecution of the
                            negotiation with that object in view, he would direct that it should be
                            assiduously pursued. But the right season seems to have passed, at least
                            for the present. Europe seems once more on the verge of quite general
                            wars. On the other hand, a portion of the American people have raised
                            the standard of insurrection, and proclaimed a provisional government,
                            and, through their organs, have taken the bad resolution to invite
                            privateers to prey upon the peaceful commerce of the United States.</p>
                        <p>Prudence and humanity combine in persuading the President, under the
                            circumstances, that it is wise to secure the lesser geode offered by the
                            Paris congress, without waiting indefinitely in hope to obtain the
                            greater one offered to the maritime nations by the President of the
                            United States.</p>
                        <p>I am, sir, respectfully, your obedient servant.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Contrary to what usually happens in giving
                            instructions to a minister going abroad, I am directed by the President
                            to ask you to fix your attention in the first instance, and to keep it
                            constantly fixed, on the actual condition of affairs at home. I allude,
                            of course, to the unlawful and unconstitutional attempt which is being
                            made to detach several of the States from the federal Union, and to
                            organize them as an independent republic under the name of the
                            “Confederate States of America.”</p>
                        <p>You are well aware of what you will find Europeans unable to understand,
                            namely, that owing to the very peculiar structure of our federal
                            government, and the equally singular character and habits of the
                            American people, this government not only wisely but necessarily
                            hesitates to resort to coercion and compulsion to secure a return of the
                            disaffected portion of the people to their customary allegiance. The
                            Union was formed upon popular consent and must always practically stand
                            on the same basis. The temporary causes of alienation must pass away;
                            there must needs be disasters and disappointments resulting from the
                            exercise of unlawful authority by the revolutionists, while happily it
                            is certain that there is a general and profound sentiment of loyalty
                            pervading the public mind throughout the United States. While it is the
                            intention of the President to maintain the sovereignty and rightful
                            authority of the Union everywhere with firmness as well as discretion,
                            he at the same time relies with great confidence on the salutary working
                            of the agencies I have mentioned, to restore the harmony and Union of
                            the States. But to this end it is of the greatest importance that the
                            disaffected States shall not succeed in obtaining favor or recognition
                            from foreign nations.</p>
                        <p>It is understood that the so-called Confederate States of America have
                            sent, or are about to send, agents to solicit such recognition in
                            Europe, although there is no special reason for supposing Prussia to be
                            one of the nations to which application will be made. An almost electric
                            political connexion, however, exists between the several capitals of
                            western Europe, and therefore your most efficient and unfailing efforts
                            must be put forth directly, and even indirectly, to prevent the success
                            of that ill-starred design.</p>
                        <p>This matter was deemed so important by the late administration that my
                            predecessor, on the 28th of February last, made it a subject of a
                            circular despatch, of which an original part was transmitted by him to
                            Mr. Wright, who proceeded you in your mission.</p>
                        <p>The present administration entertain the same general view of the subject
                            which in that despatch was taken by Mr. Buchanan. Accordingly, on the
                            9th day of March instant, I sent to our representatives abroad a new
                            circular letter in which I reiterated and amplified the instructions
                            which <pb n="38" xml:id="pg_38" facs="0038"/> had thus been given to
                            them by Mr. Black. Although that circular will be found in the archives
                            of your legation, yet for your greater convenience I append a copy of it
                            to this communication.</p>
                        <p>This department has little more to add to that paper when it is read, as
                            it ought to be, in connexion with the President’s inaugural address, on
                            which it rests for its basis.</p>
                        <p>It may, however, be well to call your attention to the fact that in that
                            communication, as in this, I have forborne altogether from discussing
                            the groundless complaints and pretexts which have been put forth by the
                            organs of disunion to justify the rash and perilous revolution which
                            they are attempting to inaugurate. I have practiced this reticence not
                            because the point is unimportant, but because the dispute is purely a
                            domestic one, and the President would not willingly have the archives of
                            our legations bear testimony to so un-American a proceeding as an
                            acknowledgment, even by indirection, that this government ever consented
                            to join issue upon a purely family matter of this kind with a portion of
                            our own citizens before a foreign tribunal. Nevertheless, should you
                            find that any weight is given to those complaints and pretexts in the
                            court to which you are accredited, your perfect knowledge of all the
                            transactions involved, will, I am sure, enable you to meet them
                            conclusively and satisfactorily without precise instructions on that
                            point.</p>
                        <p>You will not take up any subject of controversy or debate that may arise
                            between the governments of Prussia and the United States, without first
                            communicating the matter to this department, and you will practice the
                            same forbearance on any subject of controversy which your predecessor
                            may have left for your attention. These instructions are given you
                            because it is our first and most earnest desire and expectation that you
                            will avoid all possible forms of offence or irritation, and will, on the
                            other hand, endeavor to establish the most friendly and cordial
                            relations with the government of the King of Prussia. With this view you
                            will assure his Majesty that the President and people of the United
                            States entertain sentiments of the highest respect and sincere good will
                            for his Majesty and the people of Prussia.</p>

                            American people in their present troubles, not only because of the
                            effect of such disturbances upon the commerce of Europe, but also on
                            account of the intimate relations between the two countries, owing to
                            the presence of a large German population in the United States, gave me
                            the most positive assurance that his government, from the principle of

                            the subject has received due consideration.</p>
                        <p>On receipt of your circular dated the 20th of April, I immediately called
                            upon Baron de Schleinitz, minister of foreign affairs, who had received
                            the proclamation of the President, and he at once promptly informed me
                            that, in his opinion, no apprehension need be entertained as to Prussian
                            subjects engaging under the authority of the so-called Confederate
                            States in fitting out privateers, or in any manner interfering with our
                            commerce. Prussia has but few ports. Hers is not a sea-faring people,
                            and the sympathies of the government and of the people are with the
                            United States. Whatever danger may be apprehended on this subject must
                            come from Bremen, Hamburg, and other ports situated in Oldenburg,
                            Hanover, &amp;c. Due vigilance will be used to prevent any such unlawful
                            interference, and if any such be detected the proper authorities will be
                            promptly advised thereof, and every effort will be made to suppress it.
                            Not knowing whether your circular has been sent to the consuls, I have
                            forwarded copies to several already.</p>

                            the <pb n="40" xml:id="pg_40" facs="0040"/> United States in the
                            protection of property and commerce, and will do all she can,
                            consistently with her obligations to other governments, to sustain the
                            vigorous action of our government in maintaining law and order.</p>
                        <p>The minister of foreign affairs, Baron Von Schleinitz, informed me on
                            yesterday that it was the intention of the government to issue a
                            proclamation touching these questions.</p>
                        <p>The government and people are, in spirit and feeling, with us. I am in
                            the receipt of hundreds of letters and personal calls seeking positions
                            in the American army, and asking for means of conveyance to our shores.
                            So numerous, indeed, are the applications, that I have been compelled to
                            place on the doors of the legation a notice to the purport that “This is
                            the legation of the United States, and not a recruiting office.” The
                            fidelity and firmness exhibited with such unanimity by our own people in
                            sustaining the administration in their efforts to put down the outrages
                            of the so-called “Confederate States,” whilst it astonishes the people
                            of the old world, is at the same time rapidly creating a sentiment of
                            confidence in our ability to maintain unimpaired the institutions of our
                            fathers.</p>
                        <p>Let the cost be what it may, we must vindicate the memory of our fathers
                            from the slanders announced by those in high places in the so-called
                            “Confederate States,” wherein they have proclaimed ours is only a
                            confederation of States, and not a national union.</p>

                            <p>The various herewith enclosed statements, by which your excellency
                                has given me a knowledge of the occurrences through which the
                                internal tranquillity of the Union is disturbed, have called forth
                                my serious consideration. The hope which, until now, we so willingly
                                entertained, that the inchoate conflict between the government of
                                the United States and sundry of the southern States of the Union
                                would be brought to an amicable settlement, is now, unhappily, in
                                view of existing conditions, borne back to a far distance.</p>
                            <p>The indubitable fact of the state of the intestine warfare in which
                                the Union is placed is a source of deep regret to the King’s
                                government. The relations of close friendship which connect Prussia
                                and the government of the United States exist from the foundation of
                                the Union. They have endured nearly a hundred years; never at any
                                time disturbed by change of circumstances, nor in any wise
                                impaired.</p>
                            <p>By a series of treaties, by means of which the improvement of the
                                interests, of manufacture and commerce on either side has been
                                eminently developed, the intimate relations between the two States
                                have attained a prosperous durability. At no time, between these two
                                powers, has any collision of antagonistic interests found a
                                foothold. The soaring flight which the internal prosperity of the
                                Union has taken, extending its range from year to year by means of
                                the bond of unity of the States thus knit together, the commanding
                                attitude which North America has attained, abroad, has been looked
                                upon by Prussia not merely with no dissatisfaction but has rather
                                been greeted by her with honest sympathy.</p>
                            <p>The more earnestly, then, do we regret that the continuance of so
                                prosperous a condition of things should appear to be placed in
                                question by the <pb n="42" xml:id="pg_42" facs="0042"/> inchoate
                                disturbance of that internal unity, the unshaken existence of which
                                had, until this time, formed the surest foundation of the Union. It
                                behooves not the royal government either to discuss the causes of
                                existing controversies or to pass judgment upon those debatable
                                questions which belong entirely to the domestic relations of the
                                Union. Our whole endeavor in this matter must be addressed to
                                sustaining the United States in their heretofore existing relations
                                with us, even under the difficult circumstances of the present
                                time.</p>
                            <p>Nevertheless, by the serious turn which the conflict that has broken
                                but has already taken, and by the consequent self-reliant mode of
                                proceeding of the government of the United States in relation to
                                blockades, and the treatment of neutral navigation, essential and
                                important interests on this side are also affected, and the royal
                                government has taken into earnest consideration the protection
                                thereof on grounds of international law and in conformity with
                                treaty stipulations.</p>
                            <p>Your excellency has full knowledge of the negotiations which, through
                                a series of years, were carried on between Prussia and the United
                                States, upon the principles which ought to be brought into
                                application in naval warfare in relation to the rights of neutral
                                shipping. It is to the credit of the North American Cabinet that, in
                                the year 1854, it availed itself of the plan of a treaty, proposed
                                with us, to be first to take the initiative for putting the rights
                                above mentioned in liberal and practical shape upon a broader
                                foundation of well settled principles. We then willingly acceded to
                                the North American proposition, and although the negotiations
                                conducted by your excellency were closed without attaining the
                                desired result, because a stand was then taken against that
                                abolition of privateering which was suggested by us, it has,
                                meantime, nevertheless, so fallen out that the general united desire
                                to establish the recognition of the rights of neutral shipping
                                daring maritime warfare upon more extended and unassailable
                                foundations has attracted, in praiseworthy degree, the attention of
                                the great powers of Europe. The declaration upon maritime rights by
                                the Paris convention, on the 16th April, 1856, stands in evidence of
                                this. The collective States of Europe, with the exception of Spain
                                only, gave their adhesion thereto. But the United States of North
                                America, in regard to the first principle concerning the abolition
                                of privateering, to our regret, thought proper to qualify their
                                assent to the Paris declaration, if we do not misapprehend the
                                liberal and well-intentioned views by which that cabinet was guided
                                in the matter. These were made known in the proposition of President
                                Pierce upon the subject, according to which the principle that
                                private property on the seas should be altogether inviolable, should
                                be included among the provisions of the law of nations. It is to be
                                regretted that the President did not succeed in giving effect to his
                                proposition. The estimation with which we regarded his course is
                                sufficiently known to your excellency.</p>
                            <p>By reason of the consequently prevailing doubts about the treatment
                                to which neutral shipping may be subjected during the condition of
                                things there connected with an incipient state of war, I must
                                request your excellency will please to make this interesting
                                question the subject of a friendly and unreserved conference with
                                the Secretary of State of that country.</p>
                            <p>It would certainly be most desirable to us that the government of the
                                United States might embrace this occasion to announce their adhesion
                                to the Paris declaration. Should this not be attained, then, for the
                                present, we would urge that an exposition might be made, to be
                                obligatory during the now commencing intestine war, in regard to the
                                application generally of the second and third principles of the
                                Paris declaration to neutral shipping. The provision of the second
                                principle, that the neutral flag covers the <pb n="43"
                                    xml:id="pg_43" facs="0043"/> enemy’s cargo, (with exception of
                                contraband of war,) is already assured to Prussian shipping by our
                                treaty with the United States of May 1, 1828, again adopting article
                                twelve of the treaty of September 10, 1785.</p>
                            <p>We lay much stress upon this toward bringing round a determination to
                                make application of this principle at the present time to neutral
                                shipping generally and universally. We doubt this the less because,
                                according to a despatch from the then President, addressed by the
                                Secretary of State, L. Cass, under date of June 27, 1859, to the
                                minister of the United States in Paris, and also communicated to us,
                                without further referring to the Paris declaration, it is expressly
                                mentioned that the principle that the neutral flag covers the
                                enemy’s cargo (contraband of war excepted) would be reduced to
                                application in respect to the shipping of the United States always,
                                and in its full extent.</p>
                            <p>The import of the third principle, by which neutral private property
                                under an enemy’s flag (except contraband of war) is inviolable,
                                becomes, in respect of its immediate recognition by the United
                                States, a stringent necessity to the neutral powers.</p>
                            <p>Let there be a doubt of the application of this principle, and the
                                business enterprises of neutral States are exposed to inevitable
                                shocks, and collisions of every conceivable kind are to be dreaded.
                                To provide for the avoidance of these in due season, <hi
                                    rend="italic">we</hi> must at least anxiously desire.</p>
                            <p>It would minister greatly to my satisfaction if your excellency, as
                                soon as may be, could officially inform me that the overtures and
                                propositions which you are commissioned to make to the
                                administration have found a favorable reception.</p>

                                    notification annexed to the mercantile classes in the Baltic
                                    ports:</p>
                                <p>It is my duty to make known to you that during the continuance of
                                    the conflict which has broken out among the North American
                                    States the mercantile classes must abstain from all enterprises
                                    which are forbidden by the general principles of international
                                    law, and especially by the ordinance of the 12th of June, 1856,
                                    which has relation to the declaration of the 12th of April,
                                    1856, upon the principles of maritime law. Moreover, I will not
                                    omit to make it especially noticeable by you that the royal
                                    government will not permit to its shipping or its subjects,
                                    which may mix up in these conflicts by taking letters of marque,
                                    sharing in privateering enterprises, carrying merchandise
                                    contraband of war, or forwarding despatches, to have the benefit
                                    of its protection against any losses which may befall them
                                    through such transactions.</p>
                                <p>The equipment of privateers in the ports of this country is
                                    forbidden by the laws of the land, as is known to the mercantile
                                    community.</p>

                        <p>The undersigned, Secretary of State of the United States, has the honor
                            of acknowledging the receipt of a copy of a letter of instruction, under
                            the date of the 13th of June, from Baron Schleinitz, the minister of
                            foreign affairs of his Majesty the King of Prussia, to Baron Gerolt, his
                            Majesty’s envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to the United
                            States, which Baron Gerolt has submitted for perusal to the
                            undersigned.</p>
                        <p>Baron Gerolt, in pursuance of this instruction, has referred to doubts
                            said to prevail in Europe about the treatment to which neutral shipping
                            may be subjected during the continuance of the internal disturbance now
                            existing in the United States, and has requested from the undersigned an
                            explanation of the views of this government thereupon.</p>
                        <p>Baron Schleinitz, in this communication, has remarked that it would
                            certainly be most desirable for Prussia that this government should
                            embrace this occasion to announce its adhesion to the celebrated
                            declaration of Paris. But that if this could not be attained, then, for
                            the present, the government of Prussia would urge that an exposition
                            might be made to be obligatory during the present intestine disturbances
                            in the United States, in regard to the application generally of the
                            second and third principles of the Paris declaration to neutral
                            shipping.</p>
                        <p>The second principle of the Paris declaration is, that the neutral flag
                            covers the enemy’s goods, not contraband of war.</p>
                        <p>The third principle is, that the goods, not contraband of war, of a
                            neutral found on board an enemy’s vessel are exempt from
                            confiscation.</p>
                        <p>The undersigned has the pleasure of informing Baron Gerolt, by authority
                            of the President of the United States, that the government cheerfully
                            declares its assent to these principles in the present case, and to
                            continue until the insurrection which now unhappily exists in the United
                            States shall have come to an end, and they will be fully observed by
                            this government in its relations with Prussia.</p>
                        <p>But the undersigned would be doing injustice to this government if he
                            should omit to add, by way of explanation, that so long ago as the 24th
                            of April last he transmitted ample instructions and powers to Mr. Judd,
                            the then newly appointed Minister of the United States to Berlin,
                            authorizing him to enter into a treaty (subject to the consent of the
                            Senate of the United States) with the kingdom of Prussia for the
                            adhesion of this, government to the declaration of the congress at
                            Paris. Similar instructions and powers were given to all the ministers
                            appointed to conduct diplomatic intercourse with all existing maritime
                            powers. This government in these instructions declared its continued
                            desire and preference for the amendment of the Paris declaration
                            proposed by this government in 1856, to the effect that the private or
                            individual property of non-combatants, whether belonging to belligerent
                            States or not, should be exempted from confiscation in maritime war. But
                            recurring to the previous failure to secure the adoption of that
                            amendment, this government instructed its ministers, if they should find
                            it necessary, to waive it for the present, and to negotiate our adhesion
                            to the declaration pure and simple.</p>
                        <p>The delay of Mr. Judd in his departure for Berlin is probably the cause
                            why this proposition was not made by him to the Prussian government
                            previous to the date of the instruction given by Baron Schleinitz to
                            Baron Gerolt, which formed the occasion of the present note.</p>
                        <pb n="45" xml:id="pg_45" facs="0045"/>
                        <p>This government having thus practically anticipated the wishes of the
                            Prussian government, the undersigned has, of course, been the more at
                            liberty to accede to those wishes in the more limited extent in which
                            they are expressed by Baron Schleinitz.</p>
                        <p>The undersigned at the same time holds himself none the less bound to
                            proceed with a view to a more ample and more formal establishment of the
                            benign principles of maritime war in regard to neutral commerce as
                            indicated in the instructions given to Mr. Judd.</p>
                        <p>Of course the undersigned will be understood as not qualifying or
                            modifying by this communication the right of the United States to close
                            any of the national ports which have already fallen or which may fall
                            into the hands of the insurgents, either directly or in the lenient and
                            equitable form of the blockade which is now in full force.</p>
                        <p>The undersigned cannot close this communication without expressing to
                            Baron Gerolt the great satisfaction with which this government has
                            learned, through the communication now acknowledged, that his Majesty
                            the King of Prussia faithfully adheres to the existing treaties between
                            the two countries, and fulfils, without question or reservation, all
                            their obligations. This announcement is accompanied by assurances of
                            good feeling and good will that will not fail, under the peculiar
                            circumstances of the times, to make a deep and lasting impression on the
                            government and the people of the United States, and to perpetuate the
                            friendship that for near a century has existed between the two countries
                            to the great advantage and lasting honor of both.</p>
                        <p>Baron Gerolt may be assured that the government and the people of the
                            United States have deliberately and carefully surveyed the unhappy
                            disturbance of their social condition which has caused so much anxiety
                            to all friendly commercial nations, and have adopted the necessary means
                            for its speedy and complete removal, so that they expect to be able to
                            prosecute their accustomed career of enterprise, and, while fulfilling
                            all the national obligations, to co-operate with enlightened nations
                            engaged, like Prussia, in enlarging and increasing the sway of commerce,
                            and in promoting and advancing the high interests of civilization and
                            humanity.</p>
                        <p>The undersigned offers to Baron Gerolt renewed assurances of his high
                            consideration.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I arrived in Berlin on Thursday, the
                            twenty-seventh ultimo, and was cordially welcomed by my predecessor, Mr.
                            Wright, whose attentions and civilities, together with the information
                            imparted to me in connexion with the mission, have tended very much to
                            make my entry into Berlin and induction into office agreeable and
                            pleasant.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Wright’s position here and his influence, as the representative of
                            our government, with the authorities, has been alike creditable and
                            honorable to himself and useful to the citizens of the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>His firm straightforward Americanism has won the respect of, and exerted
                            a decided influence upon, the ruling powers of this kingdom.</p>
                        <p>On the 28th of June Mr. Wright applied to his excellency Baron
                            Schleinitz, minister of foreign affairs, for an interview, for the
                            purpose of presenting his open letter of recall, and affording me the
                            opportunity of presenting the copy of my letter of credence, and
                            requesting my presentation to his Majesty the King.</p>
                        <p>The baron named the next day, at three o’clock p. m.; and, in accordance
                            with the appointment, Mr. Wright and myself called upon the minister and
                            presented our respective letters. In reply to my request for an
                            audience, the baron stated that the King was at Potsdam; that he would
                            notify him of our wishes, and advise of his Majesty’s pleasure upon the
                            subject.</p>
                        <p>* * * *</p>
                        <p>On Monday, the first of July, a note from the minister advised me that
                            the King would receive me in private audience at his palace in Berlin at
                            half past four p. m. of that day.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Wright and myself attended, in pursuance of the summons, and were
                            presented to his Majesty by Baron Schleinitz.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Wright presented his letter of recall, and addressed his Majesty some
                            remarks appropriate to the occasion, of which his despatch of to-day
                            will contain an account.</p>
                        <p>I then presented my letter of credence, and stated to his Majesty that I
                            was instructed by the President to convey to him the President’s wishes
                            for his health and happiness, and for the prosperity of his kingdom.
                            That our government desired that the friendly relations so long existing
                            between the two governments might continue and increase with the growing
                            prosperity <pb n="47" xml:id="pg_47" facs="0047"/> of the two nations.
                            That for myself, personally, I hoped that my residence near his
                            Majesty’s government might be useful to the citizens of my country, and
                            acceptable to his Majesty. That I should endeavor in my official action
                            to promote and increase the harmony, good will, and friendly feelings
                            that had so long existed between the two nations, and that I presented
                            my own best wishes for the health and happiness of his Majesty.</p>
                        <p>The King, in reply, expressed his warm feelings towards Mr. Wright, and
                            stated that he regretted the troubles in our country; that he hoped soon
                            to see them ended, and the integrity and majesty of our government and
                            law maintained, and order triumph.</p>
                        <p>He thanked Mr. Wright for his allusion to the past friendly relations,
                            and the manner in which he had promoted the same, and assured us that he
                            was happy to hear through me the assurance of the continuance of the
                            same.</p>
                        <p>The day following my presentation was occupied by me in establishing my
                            relations with the ministers of state and the several diplomatic
                            functionaries residing at this court.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be your obedient servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: On the 9th of July instant, in pursuance
                            of the special instructions contained in despatch No. 4, from the
                            Department of State to this legation, under date of April 24, 1861, to
                            seek an early opportunity to ascertain whether the government of Prussia
                            is disposed to enter into negotiations for the accession of the
                            government of the United States to the articles of the declaration of
                            the congress assembled at Paris, April 16, 1856, on the question of
                            privateering and maritime war, I had an interview with Baron Von
                            Schleinitz, minister of foreign affairs of his Majesty the King of
                            Prussia. In communicating to the baron my instructions on that subject,
                            and informing him of the disposition of the government of the United
                            States to bring the negotiation on the basis of the Paris declaration to
                            a speedy and satisfactory conclusion, I, at the same time, expressed to
                            him how eminently desirable for the good of all nations the President
                            deems it that the property and effects, not contraband of war, of
                            private individuals, although citizens of belligerent States, should be
                            exempt from seizure and confiscation by national vessels in time of
                            maritime war. The baron, in response, assured me that his Majesty’s
                            government desired to adopt the most liberal policy on that subject.</p>
                        <p>I then alluded to his instructions to Baron Von Gerolt, the Prussian
                            minister in Washington, as published in the official journal, the
                            “Staats Arzeiger,” <pb n="48" xml:id="pg_48" facs="0048"/> and inquired
                            if it was desired to transfer the negotiations to Washington He replied
                            in the negative, adding that the purpose and intent of the document
                            chiefly was to give utterance to, and make manifest the good will of,
                            his Majesty’s government towards that of the United States, and to
                            furnish a full and free communication and exchange of views between the
                            two governments.</p>
                        <p>In reply to his inquiry, whether the President of the United States,
                            through me, was prepared to submit propositions for a convention, I
                            informed him that I had special powers to negotiate a treaty based upon
                            the Paris declaration, and that a memorandum for that purpose had been
                            prepared by the Department of State for my guidance. To my inquiry,
                            whether the production of the evidence of my special authority was
                            desired at this time, he replied negatively, but asked to be informed
                            whether the treaty was intended to be a joint one with all the parties
                            to the Paris conference, or a separate convention with each one of the
                            parties. I responded that my instructions directed me to negotiate with
                            the Prussian government only. He then requested that the propositions of
                            the government of the United States be submitted in writing, promising,
                            in that event, an early consideration of the same. Accordingly, on the
                            11th day of July instant, I addressed a communication to Baron Von
                            Schleinitz, minister of foreign affairs, together with a copy of the
                            memorandum for a convention upon the subject of belligerents and
                            neutrals in time of war between the United States of America and his
                            Majesty the King of Prussia, as furnished me by the Department of State,
                            in connexion with its despatch No. 4, under date of April 24, 1861. A
                            copy of my communication accompanies this despatch, marked Exhibit No.
                            1. No reply has yet been received from Baron Von Schleinitz to that
                            communication.</p>

                                extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary, has the honor herewith
                                to present the memoranda referred to in our conversation of
                                yesterday, it being simply a statement of the articles of the
                                declaration adopted by the congress assembled at Paris, April 16,
                                1856.</p>
                            <p>While the President has instructed the undersigned to present and
                                assent to a convention in terms substantially that of the congress
                                at Paris, the President, nevertheless, desires the undersigned to
                                submit to the government of his Majesty the King of Prussia how just
                                and eminently desirable for the good of all nations he considers it
                                that the property and effects of private individuals, not contraband
                                of war, should be exempt from seizure and confiscation by national
                                vessels in time of maritime war, although belonging to the citizens
                                and subjects of the belligerent States; and in view of this fact,
                                the undersigned begs leave to state to your excellency that he feels
                                authorized and prepared to so modify the propositions he has the
                                honor herewith to submit as to embrace the principle above stated,
                                if it should <pb n="49" xml:id="pg_49" facs="0049"/> meet the views
                                and be deemed desirable by the government of his Majesty the King of
                                Prussia.</p>
                            <p>The undersigned avails himself of this opportunity to assure your
                                excellency of his high and distinguished consideration.</p>

                            22, was duly received.</p>
                        <p>Baron Gerolt has handed to me a copy of the instruction from his
                            government, to which Mr. Wright refers. I have acknowledged the tenor of
                            that paper as not unacceptable, but I agree with Mr. Wright in thinking
                            it desirable that the strongest possible expressions be obtained from
                            Prussia for their moral effect.</p>
                        <p>Our army on the Potomac encountered a reverse on the 21st, which, for the
                            moment, produced a shock; but the evil effects of the disaster have
                            already passed away, while a more vigorous and determined resolution
                            exists now than ever to strengthen and preserve the Union.</p>
                        <p>We have put all the candidates recommended to us by Baron Schleinitz into

                        <p>Since my written communication to Baron Von Schleinitz on the subject of
                            the maritime treaty, a copy of which was sent to the State Department in
                            my despatch No. 4, I have not heard from this government directly upon
                            the subject; but Baron Von Mohrenheim, of the Russian legation, informs
                            me that, in conversation with Baron Von Schleinitz, the latter expressed
                            the opinion that the object sought by the United States could be
                            attained by a simple adhesion on its part to the articles of the Paris
                            treaty, and that there was no necessity for a formal and separate
                            treaty. I also learned from Baron Von Mohrenheim that the Russian
                            government inclined to the same opinion. My conversations with the
                            members of the diplomatic corps here have convinced me that they are not
                            only thoroughly advised of the views and action of their own governments
                            in this matter, but that every step taken by any government interested
                            is promptly communicated, so that each representative is fully advised
                            of the condition of the question with all the governments, and that
                            there is concerted action, with England at the head.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your despatch of September 24 (No. 8) has
                            been received. It treats of many matters interesting, though not of
                            chief importance. Your proceedings in regard to them are approved.
                            Disunion, by surprise and impetuous passion, took the first successes,
                            and profited by them to make public opinion in Europe. Union comes
                            forward more slowly, but with greater and more enduring vigor. This
                            nation, like every other, in the present as in all other cases, stands
                            by its own strength. Other powers will respect it so long as it exhibits
                            its ability to defend and save itself. More, perhaps, ought not to be
                            wished; certainly it could not be reasonably expected.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Having spent the winter in Washington, you
                            need not be informed of the attempts of a misguided party of citizens in
                            several of the southern States, not unattended with violence and
                            spoliation, to dismember the federal republic, and of their scheme to
                            organize several of the States in a new revolutionary government, under
                            the name of the Confederate States of America. Formidable as this
                            conspiracy seemed at the beginning, it is now confidently believed that
                            the policy of the present administration in regard to it will be
                            supported by the people—a policy of conciliationr forbearance, and
                            firmness—and that the conspiracy will thus fail for want of ultimate
                            adoption by the States themselves which are expected to constitute the
                            new confederacy. Aware of this danger, the movers in that desperate and
                            destructive enterprise are now understood to be making; every effort to
                            gain external advantage by appeals to prejudice or supposed interest in
                            foreign nations for a recognition of the independence of the proposed
                            new confederacy.</p>
                        <p>Under these circumstances the most important duty of the diplomatic
                            representatives of the United States in Europe will be to counteract by
                            all proper means the efforts of the agents of that projected confederacy
                            at their respective courts. It was your extensive acquaintance on the
                            continent, taken in connexion with your activity and energy here, which
                            induced the President to confer upon you the appointment of minister
                            resident in Belgium.</p>
                        <p>The general considerations to be urged against such a recognition will be
                            found in the inaugural address of the President, delivered on the 4th of
                            March instant, and in a circular letter despatched by me on the 9th
                            instant to our ministers, an original part of which will be found in the
                            archives of your legation. For your present convenience I enclose a copy
                            of this circular letter.</p>
                        <p>The President, confident of the ultimate ascendancy of law, order, and
                            the Union, through the deliberate action of the people in constitutional
                            forms, does not expect you to engage in any discussion which the agents
                            of the disunionists may attempt to initiate on the merits of their
                            proposed revolution. He will not consent, directly or indirectly, to the
                            interpellation of any foreign power in a controversy which is merely a
                            domestic one.</p>
                        <p>There is some reason to suppose that the agents of the disunionists will
                            attempt to win favor for their scheme of recognition by affecting to
                            sympathize with the manufacturing interests of the European nations in
                            their discontent with the tariff laws of the United States, and by
                            promising to receive the fabrics of such nations on more favorable
                            terms. You will be able to reply to such seductions as these that the
                            new tariff laws thus complained of are revenue laws deemed by the
                            legislature of the United States necessary under new and peculiar
                            circumstances; that all experience shows <pb n="54" xml:id="pg_54"
                                facs="0054"/> that such laws are not and cannot be permanent; that
                            if, as is now pretended, they shall prove to be onerous to foreign
                            commerce, they will, of course, prove also to be unfruitful of revenue,
                            and that in that case they will necessarily be promptly modified. The
                            inconvenience, if any shall result from them, will therefore be
                            temporary and practically harmless. Nor will any statesman of a foreign
                            country need to be informed that the consumption of the fabrics which it
                            is proposed shall be favored by the so-called seceding States chiefly
                            takes place, not within those States, but in a very large degree in the
                            States which remain undisturbed by this unhappy attempt at
                            revolution.</p>
                        <p>It hardly needs be added that the recognition which the insurgents States
                            desire tends through either peace or war to the establishment of a new
                            government. That new government, like the government of the United
                            States, must levy imports on foreign merchandise, while it must also
                            resort to an export duty on cotton, its great staple, for its support;
                            and these two measures combined would constitute a policy largely
                            prohibitive, instead of the liberal and genial one which is now promised
                            by the disunion party.</p>
                        <p>You will not fail to represent to the government of the King of the
                            Belgians that all the interests of European manufactures and commerce
                            are identified with the promotion of peace and the undisturbed activity
                            of the American people. An act of recognition in favor of a now
                            discontented party would necessarily tend to encourage that party to
                            attempt to establish their separation from the Union by civil war, the
                            consequences of which would be disastrous to all the existing systems of
                            industrial activity in Europe, and when once they had begun, those
                            consequences would be likely to continue indefinitely; whereas no nation
                            in Europe can hope that their own interests would be as safe and
                            prosperous under any change of government here as they are now and have
                            so long been under our present system.</p>
                        <p>It is quite manifest already that differences and embarrassing questions
                            may soon arise concerning the conduct of commerce, and that the
                            commercial States of Europe may be subjected to strong seductions to
                            violate our revenue laws and regulations. You will say generally on this
                            subject that the government of the United States will expect the same
                            respect to those laws and regulations which has hitherto been shown and
                            which our treaties of amity and commerce entitle us to demand, and that
                            it will not hold itself bound to favor or exempt from consequences any
                            parties, of whatever nation, who may violate them. It does not at all
                            distrust its ability to maintain them or the good disposition of its
                            allies to observe them.</p>
                        <p>I shall not enlarge on these subjects, insomuch as the phase of the whole
                            affair changes almost daily. The President willingly expects to rely on
                            your astuteness in discovering points of attack and your practical skill
                            and experience in protecting the interests of the United States. He will
                            expect you, however, to communicate to this department very fully and
                            frequently, and you will receive prompt instructions in every new
                            emergency.</p>

                        <p>I was received by the King, to present my letter of credence, on the 8th,
                            in “solemn audience,” and made on the occasion an address, of which I
                            enclose a copy, (A.)</p>
                        <p>The King replied that he highly appreciated the sentiments of friendly
                            feeling, of which I bore to him the expression, from the President, and
                            the flattering terms, as he expressed it, in which they were couched. He
                            desired me to tender to the President his thanks for them, and to say
                            that he reciprocated fully the desire for the continuance of the
                            friendly and cordial relations which, during the more than thirty years
                            that had elapsed since the formation of his government, had marked our
                            intercourse, and he hoped for the continued prosperity of the United
                            States. After some remarks complimentary to myself and my former
                            residence in Europe, he entered into general conversation, in which he
                            showed great interest in and knowledge of the United States, manifesting
                            a warm desire to have the means of direct intercourse increased between
                            the two countries. The genius of his people, he said, was rather for
                            industrial pursuits at home, and in which they had been very successful;
                            but they had failed upon the seas; and he thought if the enterprise and
                            practical knowledge of our people could be brought to bear in favor of
                            steam communication between Belgium and the United States, a large trade
                            could be diverted through this channel, Antwerp being a natural entrepôt
                            for Central Europe.</p>
                        <p>His Majesty spoke but generally of the insurrection in the southern
                            States; said he hoped that some peaceful issue would be found, and that
                            the spirit of conciliation would prevail, and then referred to the
                            growing markets they had for their manufactures in the United States. My
                            audience, which was lengthened by a long conversation on general
                            subjects, was most satisfactory, in the very kind and cordial spirit
                            manifested by his Majesty.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I had a conversation to-day with M. de
                            Vrière on the subject of the efforts of the commissioners of the
                            so-called “Confederate States” to obtain recognition of the European
                            powers.</p>
                        <p>He informed me that no application had been made to him in this view, nor
                            would it now be entertained if made. The revolution would receive no <pb
                                n="56" xml:id="pg_56" facs="0056"/> sanction by any act of Belgium.
                            A small State, he continued, whose prosperity depended on the full
                            exercise of the industrial pursuits of its people, they did not mingle
                            in foreign politics, their policy being not to imperil their interests
                            by stepping beyond the limits of strict neutrality in their intercourse
                            with other States. They should, therefore, remain “neutral,” as he
                            expressed it, in respect to this question. They had not even yet
                            recognized the Italian government, he added. We desired, I told him, not
                            to be subjected to any interference in the settlement of our domestic
                            affairs, whether in the form of recognition of political existence or of
                            belligerent rights of those who were in open rebellion to the government
                            and laws of the United States. It was an issue between order and anarchy
                            which we were fully able to cope with, and all Europe was interested
                            that its settlement be in the most prompt and effective manner, as least
                            liable to cause permanent derangement to commerce.</p>
                        <p>In reply to my inquiry, he said he had received no official information
                            of the blockade of our southern ports, proclaimed by the President,
                            although he had late advices from the Belgian minister at Washington. He
                            had only knowledge of it, he said, as printed in the papers. In answer
                            to his inquiry, I said I thought it would not injuriously affect the
                            supply of cotton, as the crop of the past year had mostly gone forward;
                            and, moreover, that while the blockade would be rigorously enforced with
                            regard to supplies, or vessels bearing the “confederate” flag, I
                            presumed, although I had no instructions on the subject, that the
                            vessels now loading, or under engagements to load in those ports, would
                            be allowed reasonable time to leave; that there was every desire to make
                            this condition of things, which was but temporary, as little
                            embarrassing as possible to foreign commerce. The minister expressed
                            great satisfaction at this, and said that the possibility of failure of
                            the cotton supply, growing out of these troubles in our southern States,
                            was causing great anxiety.</p>
                        <p>M. de Vrière then spoke of the new tariff with a great deal of feeling;
                            said that it was highly prejudicial to their interests, instancing in
                            point that forty furnaces for the manufacture of window glass had been
                            stopped inconsequence, and expressed his surprise that, in this age of
                            progress, when Europe was abandoning the exploded system, as he
                            expressed himself, of differential duties, the United States should
                            pursue such a course. Their own experience as a manufacturing people had
                            convinced them of the bad policy of such a system for the interests of
                            the manufacturers themselves. I replied that I presumed the general
                            interruptions of trade consequent upon apprehended war in the United
                            States was, quite as much as the new tariff, a cause for suspension of
                            the traffic he referred to. The tariff had been augmented by the last
                            Congress to produce more revenue; if it failed to produce such result,
                            it would probably be changed; it was a matter dependent on the will of
                            Congress, and he was aware we had had several changes in the past few
                            years, none of which had apparently given satisfaction to the
                            manufacturing States of Europe which desired to supply our markets;
                            still, it was our main source of revenue, and the system of raising
                            means for the expenses of the government by a duty on importations would
                            probably long continue.</p>

                        <p>I took my leave of M. de Vrière with the repeated assurance that no
                            countenance would be given, in any form, to the rebellion in our
                            southern States.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: As M. de Vrière is out of town, I directed
                            the attention of Monsieur Saluremont, the secretary general, who is
                            charged with the affairs of the department in the absence of the
                            minister, in an interview with him to-day, as to the propriety of a
                            proclamation warning Belgians from taking service under those in
                            rebellion to the federal government, furnishing them “aid and comfort,”
                            and, especially, closing the ports of Belgium to their “<hi
                                rend="italic">privateers</hi>”—declared by the President to be
                            pirates—or permitting them to be fitted out in her ports. I said that
                            while the assurances I had received from M. de Vrière, soon after my
                            arrival, of the attitude of his government had been satisfactory, I
                            hoped it would now give public expression to them, both as due to a
                            friendly power and as a warning to their own citizens of the perils of
                            such enterprises.</p>
                        <p>Mons. Saluremont replied that the matter had been under consideration;
                            that the position which England and France had taken had not seemed to
                            be satisfactory to the government of the United States, and they had
                            delayed, in consequence, taking any formal steps; but not, he begged me
                            to be assured, from any want of friendly spirit or desire to do all the
                            occasion called for at their hands.</p>
                        <p>I replied that he was correct in his views of our sentiments as to the
                            course which England and France had seen fit to pursue. We could not
                            look upon the recognition of belligerent rights to those who, under our
                            laws, were rebels, and before we had attempted to employ forcible means
                            of coercion, as evincing the friendly spirit we had a right to expect;
                            that these people would be treated none the less as rebels on the land
                            as pirates on the seas—they or those of whatever nationality who joined
                            them; and we counted, on the part of Belgium, upon no such qualification
                            of our citizens in rebellion, whom we were engaged in submitting to the
                            action of our laws.</p>
                        <p>He said their legislation provided generally for the cases I had
                            instanced, but that attention would be immediately given to the subject,
                            and he thought we need not have any reason to be dissatisfied with the
                            action they would take in the premises.</p>
                        <p>He then told me that our new tariff law was a subject of great complaint
                            in Belgium, and great distress in some branches of industry which it had
                            destroyed, referring specially to glass and some kinds of woollen
                            goods.</p>
                        <p>I again explained our system of revenue, which all manufacturing States
                            this side the Atlantic insist upon believing to be disadvantageous to
                            their interests.</p>

                            official journal (the <hi rend="italic">Moniteur</hi>) of the 25th
                            ultimo, in which, basing its action upon the stipulations of the
                            declaration of the congress of Paris of April 16, 1856, it is announced
                            that instructions have been addressed to the judicial, maritime, and
                            military authorities to inform them that privateers of no nation or
                            flag, alone or with their prizes, will be permitted, save in cases of
                            extreme danger by stress of weather, to enter the ports of Belgium;
                            enjoining upon them to recognize no commission or letter of marque as
                            having validity; and warning all subject to the Belgian laws that in
                            taking part or service in any privateers they incur risk of being
                            treated as pirates abroad, and of being prosecuted with the utmost rigor
                            of the laws at home. In thanking the acting minister for this prompt
                            response to my request, I observed that while this was sufficient, in so
                            far as it went, for the occasion that called it forth—as we had, and
                            expected to have, no privateers upon the sea at this time—still, so long
                            as we were not a party to the declaration of Paris, the employment of
                            privateers by the United States was undoubtedly as much a belligerent
                            right as the employment of militia on land; and in the event of a
                            foreign war we should expect, on the part of friendly powers, no such
                            impediment to its exercise by any injurious distinction between it and
                            the other arms of the public service.</p>

                                Belgian <hi rend="italic">Moniteur</hi> of June 8, 1856.</p>
                            <p>The commercial public is notified that instructions on this subject
                                have been given to the judicial, maritime, and military authorities,
                                warning them that privateers, under whatever flag or commission, or
                                letters of marque, are not to be allowed to enter our ports except
                                in case of imminent perils of the sea. The aforesaid authorities are
                                charged, consequently, to keep a strict watch upon all such
                                privateers and their prizes, and to compel them to put to sea again
                                as soon as practicable.</p>
                            <p>The same authorities have been charged not to recognize the validity
                                of any commission or letter of marque whatsoever.</p>
                            <p>All persons subject to the laws of Belgium, who shall fit out or take
                                any part in any privateering expedition, will therefore expose
                                themselves to the danger, on the one hand, of being treated as
                                pirates abroad, and, on the other, to prosecution before Belgian
                                tribunals with all the rigor of the laws.</p>

                            of the 24th ultimo, which has been addressed to the several ministers of
                            the United States accredited to the maritime powers whose
                            plenipotentiaries composed the congress of Paris of the 16th April,
                            1856, calling their attention to the importance of endeavoring to
                            negotiate with those powers conventions upon the subject of the rights
                            of belligerents and neutrals in time of war. The government of Belgium
                            was not represented in the Paris congress; but the negotiation of a
                            similar convention with that government is considered desirable, and you
                            will therefore be governed by the instruction of which I enclose a
                            transcript, and endeavor to effect that object. With this view I
                            herewith send you a full power and a draft of the proposed
                            convention.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your despatches (No. 5, dated May 26, and
                            No. 6, of the same date) have been received. We are especially pleased
                            with Mr. De Vrière’s just and friendly sentiments in regard to our
                            affairs.</p>
                        <p>You are aware that the declaration of Paris enjoins each of the parties
                            that have signed it not to negotiate any other changes of the law of
                            nations concerning the rights of neutrals in maritime war. We have
                            supposed that this would operate to prevent Great Britain, and probably
                            France, from receiving our accession to the declaration, if we should
                            insist on the amendment proposed by Mr. Marcy, namely, the exemption of
                            private property of non-belligerents from confiscation. But we should
                            now, as the instructions heretofore given you have already informed you,
                            vastly prefer to have that amendment accepted. Nevertheless, if this
                            cannot be done, let the convention be made for adherence to the
                            declaration pure and simple.</p>
                        <p>The feverish excitement which prevailed when you left the country is
                            passing away. Public confidence in the ability of the government to
                            repress the insurrection and preserve the Union is practically restored,
                            and the beneficial result that two months ago seemed problematical is
                            now regarded as only a question of time.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have not been unmindful of your
                            instructions (No. 2) respecting a convention for the abrogation of
                            passports for our citizens travelling or sojourning in Belgium.</p>
                        <p>As already intimated in my first despatch, passports are already almost
                            virtually abolished here, the <hi rend="italic">visa</hi> being no
                            longer necessary. The usual course of this government in respect to this
                            subject is, upon notification by a government that Belgians are not
                            required to be provided with passports to enter upon or travel within
                            its territories, to exempt equally citizens or subjects of such nations
                            in Belgium.</p>
                        <p>This course has been pursued with Sweden and Holland, and will be soon
                            followed with France and England.</p>
                        <p>In view of the disturbances in our southern States, and the consequent
                            impossibility of assuring entire reciprocity of exemption from passports
                            throughout our territory, I have not deemed it advisable at this time to
                            make any proposition on this subject.</p>
                        <p>I am assured by Mr. De Vrière that, on formal notification that Belgians
                            will not be required to present passports in the United States, the
                            proper authorities here will direct the exemption of citizens of the
                            United States travelling here from the requirement of passports.</p>
                        <p>They would need, however, in case of domicile here, some document to
                            prove their identity. In this connexion, it may not be out of place to
                            refer to a conversation I had some time since on this subject of the
                            abolition of passports, with the officer in charge of that branch of the
                            public service in France.</p>
                        <p>He said that they had already exempted British subjects coming to France
                            from the action of the passport regulations, and had lately made similar
                            exemptions with regard to Sweden, and were about to make the same
                            exemptions with respect to Belgium, and would with most other nations on
                            a footing of reciprocity. This was, however, a purely administrative
                            act, liable to be recalled whenever considered for the interest of the
                            state. They would in no case make a treaty which should bind them to the
                            perpetual abolition of passports <hi rend="italic">vis-a-vis</hi> to my
                            nation.</p>
                        <p>In the present aspect of affairs in the United States, they deemed it
                            important <pb n="61" xml:id="pg_61" facs="0061"/> to have a control over
                            the movements of their citizens to the United States and <hi
                                rend="italic">vice versa</hi> of ours in French territory; and
                            deemed the present an inopportune time to make any change in the
                            passport system with respect to the United States.</p>
                        <p>When matters returned to their normal condition, there would be no
                            objection, he said, to suspend their passport regulations for citizens
                            of the United States, and a simple administrative order was all that was
                            necessary on their part, and could be made at any time when deemed
                            expedient.</p>

                            received. It is, in the main, not unsatisfactory, so far as the subject

                            the subject has become somewhat complicated, and it would be a tedious
                            labor to make a distinct explanation to each of our ministers abroad. I

                        <p>I have as yet received no reply from M. De Vrière to my note to him of

                            congress of Paris. I referred to it a few days since on the occasion of
                            a visit to the foreign office, and was told that my proposition had been
                            communicated to the French government, and that communication had been
                            made by it to this government of the main points of the note addressed
                            by M. Thouvenel to M. Mercier in the month of May upon this subject of
                            neutral rights. I inferred from this that they were awaiting the result
                            of the communications made to you by the French and English governments

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I called yesterday at the department of
                            foreign affairs to press again upon the attention of Baron De Vrière the
                            proposition of adhesion to the declaration of Paris, made to him near
                            two months since, and he being out of town, I saw the secretary general,
                            who, as before said, replaces the minister in his absence.</p>
                        <p>In reply to my question whether the government had come to any decision,
                            he said that they were not yet sufficiently informed of the condition of
                            this subject at other courts to give me any positive answer; that while
                            he would not say that they would give a negative one, the policy and
                            acts of Belgium being, as I was aware, doubtless most liberal, yet they
                            did not feel, as a smaller power, justified in taking any step of this
                            nature in advance of their neighbors.</p>
                        <p>I inquired whether there was any other objection to this proposed
                            convention than he had indicated, in order to learn whether the addition
                            of the Marcy proposition was considered an impediment. He said he was
                            not prepared to give any other; that their position with regard to
                            neighboring powers, to whom Belgium owed, in one sense, her nationality,
                            was a delicate one, and they did not feel authorized to take any
                            initiative in negotiations of this character; they left that to those
                            powers who must necessarily have a controlling influence in general
                            politics.</p>

                        <p>It is thus evident that this government will do nothing till after the
                            great powers have decided upon a course of action in this matter.</p>

                            us, and other powers having silently acquiesced, we shall hardly expect

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The actual condition of affairs in Mexico
                            is so imperfectly understood here that the President finds it very
                            difficult to give you particular and practical directions for the
                            regulation of your conduct during your mission.</p>
                        <p>Our latest information was, in substance, that the provisional government
                            of President Juarez, so long confined to the sea-coasts of the country,
                            had finally overthrown its adversaries and established itself at the
                            capital; that the opposing armies had been demoralized and dispersed,
                            and that there was no longer any armed resistance in the States; that an
                            election for president had been held, in conformity with the
                            constitution of 1857, and that the now provisional president had
                            probably secured a majority of the votes, although the result was as yet
                            not certainly known. The pleasure which these events have inspired is
                            unhappily diminished by rumors that the government is without sufficient
                            authority or hold on the public confidence to maintain order; that
                            robberies are of frequent occurrence on the high roads, and even that a
                            member of our late legation in the country has been murdered on his way
                            from the city of Mexico to Vera Cruz.</p>
                        <p>You will apply yourself at once, with energy and diligence, to
                            investigate the truth of this last-mentioned occurrence, which, if found
                            to have been accurately reported, will not only be regarded as a high
                            offence against the dignity and honor of the United States, but will
                            prove a severe shock to the sensibilities of the American people.</p>
                        <p>The President is unable to conceive that any satisfactory explanation of
                            a transaction so injurious to the character of Mexico can be made. He
                            will, however, wait for your report concerning it, though with the
                            deepest anxiety, before taking action upon the subject.</p>
                        <p>I find the archives here full of complaints against the Mexican
                            government for violations of contracts and spoliations and cruelties
                            practiced against American citizens. These complaints have been lodged
                            in this department, from time to time, during the long reign of civil
                            war in which the factions of Mexico have kept that country involved,
                            with a view to having them made the basis of demands for indemnity and
                            satisfaction whenever government should regain in that country
                            sufficient solidity to assume a character for responsibility. It is not
                            the President’s intention to send forward such claims at the present
                            moment. He willingly defers the performance of a duty which at any time
                            would seem ungracious, until the incoming administration in Mexico shall
                            have had time, if possible, to cement its authority and reduce the yet
                            disturbed elements of society to order and harmony. You will, however,
                            be expected, in some manner which will be marked with firmness as well
                            as liberality, to keep the government there in mind that such of these
                            claims as shall be found just will, in due time, be presented and urged
                            upon its consideration.</p>
                        <p>While now, as heretofore, it is a duty of this government to reason with
                                <pb n="66" xml:id="pg_66" facs="0066"/> that of Mexico, and
                            deprecate a continuance of the chronic reign of disorder there, a crisis
                            has unhappily arrived, in which the performance of this duty is
                            embarrassed by the occurrence of civil commotions in our own country, by
                            which Mexico, in consequence of her proximity, is not unlikely to be
                            affected. The spirit of discontent seems, at last, to have crossed the
                            border, and to be engaged in an attempt to overthrow the authority of
                            this government in some parts of the country which adjoin the Mexican
                            republic. It is much to be feared that new embarrassments of the
                            relations of the two countries will happen when authority so long
                            prostrated on the Mexican side finds the power of the United States
                            temporarily suspended on this side of the frontier. Whatever evils shall
                            thus occur, it is much to be feared will be aggravated by the
                            intervention of the Indians, who have been heretofore with difficulty
                            restrained from violence, even while the federal authority has been
                            adequately maintained.</p>
                        <p>Both of the governments must address themselves to this new and annoying
                            condition of things, with common dispositions to mitigate its evils and
                            abridge its duration as much as possible.</p>
                        <p>The President does not expect that you will allude to the origin or
                            causes of our domestic difficulties in your intercourse with the
                            government of Mexico, although that government will rightfully as well
                            as reasonably ask what are his expectations of their course and their
                            end. On the contrary, the President will not suffer the representatives
                            of the United States to engage in any discussion of the merits of those
                            difficulties in the presence of foreign powers, much less to invoke even
                            their censure against those of our fellow-citizens who have arrayed
                            themselves in opposition to its authority.</p>
                        <p>But you are instructed to assure the government of Mexico that these
                            difficulties, having arisen out of no deep and permanent popular
                            discontent, either in regard to our system of government itself, or to
                            the exercise of its authority, and being attended by social evils which
                            are as ruinous as they are unnecessary, while no organic change that is
                            contemplated could possibly bring to any portion of the American people
                            any advantages of security, peace, prosperity, or happiness equal to
                            those which the federal Union so effectually guaranties, the President
                            confidently believes and expects that the people of the United States,
                            in the exercise of the wisdom that hitherto has never failed them, will
                            speedily and in a constitutional way adopt all necessary remedies for
                            the restoration of the public peace and the preservation of the federal
                            Union.</p>
                        <p>The success of this government in conducting affairs to that consummation
                            may depend in some small degree on the action of the government and
                            people of Mexico in this new emergency. The President could not fail to
                            see that Mexico, instead of being benefited by the prostration or the
                            obstruction of federal authority in this country, would be exposed by it
                            to new and fearful dangers. On the other hand, a condition of anarchy in
                            Mexico must necessarily operate as a seduction to those who are
                            conspiring against the integrity of the Union to seek strength and
                            aggrandizement for themselves by conquests in Mexico and other parts of
                            Spanish America. Thus, even the dullest observer is at last able to see
                            what was long ago distinctly seen by those who are endowed with any
                            considerable perspicacity, that peace, order, and constitutional
                            authority in each and all of the several republics of this continent are
                            not exclusively an interest of any one or more of them, but a common and
                            indispensable interest of them all.</p>
                        <p>This sentiment will serve as a key to open to you, in every case, the
                            purposes, wishes, and expectations of the President in regard to your
                            mission <pb n="67" xml:id="pg_67" facs="0067"/> which, I hardly need to
                            say, he considers at this juncture perhaps the most interesting and
                            important one within the whole circle of our international
                            relations.</p>
                        <p>The President of the United States does not know, and he will not consent
                            to know, with prejudice or undue favor any political party, religious
                            class, or sectional interest in Mexico. He regrets that anything should
                            have occurred to disturb the peaceful and friendly relations of Mexico
                            with some of the foreign States lately represented at her capital. He
                            hopes most sincerely that those relations may be everywhere renewed and
                            re-invigorated, and that the independence and sovereignty of Mexico and
                            the government which her people seem at last to have accepted, after so
                            many conflicts, may be now universally acknowledged and respected.</p>
                        <p>Taking into view the actual condition and circumstances of Mexico, as
                            well as those of the United States, the President is fully satisfied
                            that the safety, welfare, and happiness of the latter would be more
                            effectually promoted if the former should retain its complete integrity
                            and independence, than they could be by any dismemberment of Mexico,
                            with a transfer or diminution of its sovereignty, even though thereby a
                            portion or the whole of the country or its sovereignty should be
                            transferred to the United States themselves. The President is moreover
                            well aware that the ability of the government and people of Mexico to
                            preserve and maintain the integrity and the sovereignty of the republic
                            might be very much impaired, under existing circumstances, by hostile or
                            unfriendly action on the part of the government or of the people of the
                            United States. If he needed any other incentive to practice justice and
                            equality towards Mexico, it would be found in the reflection that the
                            very contention and strife in our own country which at this moment
                            excite so much domestic disquietude and so much surprise throughout a
                            large part of the world, could probably never have happened if Mexico
                            had always been able to maintain with firmness real and unquestioned
                            sovereignty and independence. But if Mexico has heretofore been more
                            unfortunate in these respects than many other modern nations, there are
                            still circumstances in her case which justify a hope that her sad
                            experience may be now coming to an end. Mexico really has, or ought to
                            have, no enemies. The world is deeply interested in the development of
                            her agricultural, and especially her mineral and commercial, resources,
                            while it holds in high respect the simple virtues and heroism of her
                            people, and, above all, their inextinguishable love of civil
                            liberty.</p>
                        <p>The President, therefore, will use all proper influence to favor the
                            restoration of order and authority in Mexico, and, so far as it may be
                            in his power, he will prevent incursions and every other form of
                            aggression by citizens of the United States against Mexico. But he
                            enjoins you to employ your best efforts in convincing the government of
                            Mexico and even the people, if, with its approval, you can reach them,
                            that the surest guaranty of their safety against such aggressions is to
                            be found in a permanent restoration of the authority of that government.
                            If, on the other hand, it shall appear in the sequel that the Mexican
                            people are only now resting a brief season to recover their wasted
                            energies sufficiently to lacerate themselves with new domestic
                            conflicts, then it is to be feared that not only the government of the
                            United States but many other governments will find it impossible to
                            prevent a resort to that magnificent country of a class of persons,
                            unhappily too numerous everywhere, who are accustomed to suppose that
                            visionary schemes of public interest, aggrandizement, or reform will
                            justify even lawless invasion, and aggression.</p>
                        <p>In connexion with this point it is proper that you should be informed
                            that <pb n="68" xml:id="pg_68" facs="0068"/> the Mexican government has,
                            through its representative here, recently complained of an apprehended
                            attempt at invasion of the State of Sonora by citizens of California,
                            acting, as is alleged, with the knowledge and consent of some of the
                            public authorities in that State. You will assure the Mexican government
                            that, due care being first taken to verify the facts thus presented,
                            effective means shall be adopted to put our neutrality laws into
                            activity.</p>
                        <p>The same representative has also expressed to the President an
                            apprehension that the removal of the federal troops from the Texan
                            border may be followed by outbreaks and violence there. There is,
                            perhaps, too much ground for this apprehension. Moreover, it is
                            impossible to forsee the course of the attempts which are taking place
                            in that region to subvert the proper authority of this government. The
                            President, however, meantime directs you to assure the Mexican
                            government that due attention shall be bestowed on the condition of the
                            frontier, with a view to the preservation and safety of the peaceable
                            inhabitants residing there. He hopes and trusts that equal attention
                            will be given to this important subject by the authorities of
                            Mexico.</p>
                        <p>These matters, grave and urgent as they are, must not altogether withdraw
                            our attention from others to which I have already incidentally alluded,
                            but which require more explicit discussion.</p>
                        <p>For a few years past, the condition of Mexico has been so unsettled as to
                            raise the question on both sides of the Atlantic whether the time has
                            not come when some foreign power ought, in the general interest of
                            society, to intervene to establish a protectorate or some other form of
                            government in that country and guaranty its continuance there. Such
                            schemes may even now be held under consideration by some European
                            nations, and there is also some reason to believe that designs have been
                            conceived in some parts of the United States to effect either a partial
                            dismemberment or a complete overthrow of the Mexican government, with a
                            view to extend over it the authority of the newly projected confederacy,
                            which a discontented part of our people are attempting to establish in
                            the southern part of our own country You may possibly meet agents of
                            this projected confederacy, busy in preparing some further revolution in
                            Mexico. You will not fail to assure the government of Mexico that the
                            President neither has, nor can ever have, any sympathy with such
                            designs, in whatever quarter they may arise or whatever character they
                            may take on.</p>
                        <p>In view of the prevailing temper and political habits and opinions of the
                            Mexican people, the President can scarcely believe that the disaffected
                            citizens of our own country, who are now attempting a dismemberment of
                            the American Union, will hope to induce Mexico to aid them by
                            recognizing the assumed independence which they have proclaimed, because
                            it seems manifest to him that such an organization of a distinct
                            government over that part of the present Union which adjoins Mexico
                            would, if possible, be fraught with evils to that country more
                            intolerable than any which the succees of those desperate measures could
                            inflict even upon the United States. At the same time it is manifest
                            that the existing political organization in this country affords the
                            surest guaranty Mexico can have that her integrity, union, and
                            independence will be respected by the whole people of the American
                            Union.</p>
                        <p>The President, however, expects that you will be watchful of such designs
                            as I have thus described, however improbable they may seem, and that you
                            will use the most effective measures in your power to counteract any
                            recognition of the projected Confederate States by the Mexican
                            government, if it shall be solicited.</p>
                        <pb n="69" xml:id="pg_69" facs="0069"/>
                        <p>Your large acquaintance with the character of the Mexican people, their
                            interests and their policy, will suggest many proper arguments against
                            such a measure, if any are needful beyond the intimations I have already
                            given.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, the President, as you are well aware, is of opinion that,
                            alienated from the United States as the Spanish American republics have
                            been for some time past—largely, perhaps, by reason of errors and
                            prejudices peculiar to themselves, and yet not altogether without fault
                            on our own part—that those States and the United States nevertheless, in
                            some respects, hold a common attitude and relation towards all other
                            nations; that it is the interest of them all to be friends as they are
                            neighbors, and to mutually maintain and support each other so far as may
                            be consistent with the individual sovereignty which each of them rightly
                            enjoys, equally against all disintegrating agencies within and all
                            foreign influences or power without their borders.</p>
                        <p>The President never for a moment doubts that the republican system is to
                            pass safely through all ordeals and prove a permanent success in our own
                            country, and so to be commended to adoption by all other nations. But he
                            thinks also that that system everywhere has to make its way painfully
                            through difficulties and embarrassments, which result from the action
                            antagonistical elements which are a legacy of former times and very
                            erent institutions. The President is hopeful of the ultimate triumph of
                            this system over all obstacles, as well in regard to Mexico as in regard
                            to every other American State; but he feels that those States are
                            nevertheless justly entitled to a greater forbearance and more generous
                            sympathies from the government and people of the United States than they
                            are likely to receive in any other quarter.</p>
                        <p>The President trusts that your mission, manifesting these sentiments,
                            will reassure the government of Mexico of his best disposition to favor
                            their commerce and their internal improvements. He hopes, indeed, that
                            your mission, assuming a spirit more elevated than one of merely
                            commerce and conventional amity, a spirit disinterested and unambitious,
                            earnestly American in the continental sense of the word, and fraternal
                            in no affected or mere diplomatic meaning of the term, while it shall
                            secure the confidence and good will of the government of Mexico, will
                            mark the inauguration of a new condition of things directly conducive to
                            the prosperity and happiness of both nations, and ultimately auspicious
                            to all other republican States throughout the world.</p>

                        <p>The present time is most propitious for securing the advantages and
                            preventing the evils which I have suggested. The government here feels
                            the strongest sympathy with the United States.</p>

                        <p>It has been my constant endeavor since my arrival here to possess the
                            Mexican mind of the true causes of our difficulties, and thus enable
                            them to estimate the danger to this republic which will result from any
                            unfavorable termination of them. I am quite sure that whilst this
                            government will endeavor to preserve peaceful relations with all the
                            European powers on fair terms, it regards the United States as its true
                            and only reliable friend in any struggle which may involve the national
                            existence. That this should be so is somewhat remarkable, when we regard
                            the deep prejudices engendered in the general Mexican mind by the loss
                            of Texas, which they attribute to our citizens, and the compulsory
                            cession of territory which was a consequence of our war with them.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Although Great Britain and the United
                            States possess adjacent dominions of large extent, and although they
                            divide, not very unequally, a considerable portion of the commerce of
                            the world, yet there are at present only two questions in debate between
                            them. One of these concerns the line of boundary running through Puget’s
                            Sound, and involves the title to the island of San Juan. The other
                            relates to a proposition for extinguishing the interest of the Hudson’s
                            Bay and Puget’s Sound agricultural companies in the Territory of
                            Washington. The discussion of these questions has hitherto been carried
                            on here, and there is no necessity for removing it to London. It is
                            expected to proceed amicably and result in satisfactory conclusions. It
                            would seem, therefore, on first thought, that you would find nothing
                            more to do in England than to observe and report current events, and to
                            cultivate friendly sentiments there towards the United States.
                            Nevertheless, the peculiar condition of our country in the present
                            juncture renders these duties a task of considerable delicacy.</p>
                        <p>You will readily understand me as alluding to the attempts which are
                            being made by a misguided portion of our fellow citizens to detach some
                            of the States and to combine them in a new organization under the name
                            of the Confederate States of America. The agitators in this bad
                            enterprise, justly estimating the influence of the European powers upon
                            even American affairs, do not mistake in supposing that it would derive
                            signal advantage from a recognition by any of those powers, and
                            especially Great Britain. Your task, therefore, apparently so simple and
                            easy, involves the responsibility of preventing the commission of an act
                            by the government of that country which would be fraught with disaster,
                            perhaps ruin, to our own.</p>
                        <p>It is by no means easy to give you instructions. They must be based on a
                            survey of the condition of the country, and include a statement of the
                            policy of the government. The insurrectionary movement, though rapid in
                            its progress, is slow in revealing its permanent character. Only
                            outlines of a policy can be drawn which must largely depend on uncertain
                            events.</p>
                        <p>The presidential election took place on the 6th of November last. The
                            canvass had been conducted in all the southern or slave States in such a
                            manner as to prevent a perfectly candid hearing there of the issue
                            involved, and so all the parties existing there were surprised and
                            disappointed in the marked result. That disappointment was quickly
                            seized for desperate purposes by a class of persons until that time
                            powerless, who had long cherished a design to dismember the Union and
                            build up a new confederacy around the Gulf of Mexico. Ambitious leaders
                            hurried the people forward, in a factious course, observing conventional
                            forms but violating altogether the deliberative spirit of their
                            constitutions. When the new federal administration came in on the 4th of
                            March last, it found itself confronted by an <pb n="72" xml:id="pg_72"
                                facs="0072"/> insurrectionary combination of seven States,
                            practicing an insidious strategy to seduce eight other States into its
                            councils.</p>
                        <p>One needs to be as conversant with our federative system as perhaps only
                            American publicists can be to understand how effectually, in the first
                            instance, such a revolutionary movement must demoralize the general
                            government. We are not only a nation, but we are States also. All public
                            officers, as well as all citizens, owe not only allegiance to the Union
                            but allegiance also to the States in which they reside. In the more
                            discontented States the local magistrates and other officers cast off at
                            once their federal allegiance, and conventions were held which assumed
                            to absolve their citizens from the same obligation. Even federal judges,
                            marshals, clerks, and revenue officers resigned their trusts.
                            Intimidation deterred loyal persons from accepting the offices thus
                            rendered vacant. So the most important faculties of the federal
                            government in those States abruptly ceased. The resigning federal
                            agents, if the expression may be used, <hi rend="italic">attorned</hi>
                            to the revolutionary authorities and delivered up to them public funds
                            and other property and possessions of large value. The federal
                            government had, through a long series of years, been engaged in building
                            strong fortifications, a navy yard, arsenals, mints, treasuries, and
                            other public edifices, not in any case for use against those States, but
                            chiefly for their protection and convenience. These had been
                            unsuspectingly left either altogether or imperfectly garrisoned or
                            guarded, and they fell, with little resistance, into the hands of the
                            revolutionary party. A general officer of the army gave up to them a
                            large quantity of military stores and other property, disbanded the
                            troops under his command, and sent them out of the territory of the
                            disaffected States.</p>
                        <p>It may be stated, perhaps without giving just offence, that the most
                            popular motive in these discontents was an apprehension of designs on
                            the part of the incoming federal administration hostile to the
                            institution of domestic slavery in the States where it is tolerated by
                            the local constitutions and laws. That institution and the class which
                            especially cherishes it are not confined to the States which have
                            revolted, but they exist in the eight other so-called slave States; and
                            these, for that reason, sympathize profoundly with the revolutionary
                            movement. Sympathies and apprehensions of this kind have, for an
                            indefinite period, entered into the bases of political parties
                            throughout the whole country, and thus considerable masses of persons,
                            whose ultimate loyalty could not be doubted, were found, even in the
                            free States, either justifying, excusing, or palliating the movement
                            towards disunion in the seceding States. The party which was dominant in
                            the federal government during the period of the last administration
                            embraced, practically, and held in unreserved communion, all
                            disunionists and sympathizers. It held the executive administration. The
                            Secretaries of the Treasury, War, and the Interior were disunionists.
                            The same party held a large majority of the Senate, and nearly equally
                            divided the House of Representatives. Disaffection lurked, if it did not
                            openly avow itself, in every department and in every bureau, in every
                            regiment and in every ship-of-war; in the post office and in the
                            custom-house, and in every legation and consulate from London to
                            Calcutta. Of four thousand four hundred and seventy officers in the
                            public service, civil and military, two thousand one hundred and
                            fifty-four were representatives of States where the revolutionary
                            movement was openly advocated and urged, even if not actually organized.
                            Our system being so completely federative and representative, no
                            provision had ever been made, perhaps none ever could have been made, to
                            anticipate this strange and unprecedented disturbance. The people were
                            shocked by successive and astounding developments of what the statute
                                <pb n="73" xml:id="pg_73" facs="0073"/> book distinctly pronounced
                            to be sedition and treason, but the magistracy was demoralized and the
                            laws were powerless. By degrees, however, a better sentiment revealed
                            itself. The executive administration hesitatingly, in part, reformed
                            itself. The capital was garrisoned; the new President came in
                            unresisted, and soon constituted a new and purely loyal administration.
                            They found the disunionists perseveringly engaged in raising armies and
                            laying sieges around national fortifications situate within the
                            territory of the disaffected States. The federal marine seemed to have
                            been scattered everywhere except where its presence was necessary, and
                            such of the military forces as were not in the remote States and
                            Territories were held back from activity by vague and mysterious
                            armistices which had been informally contracted by the late President,
                            or under his authority, with a view to postpone conflict until
                            impracticable concessions to disunion should be made by Congress, or at
                            least until the waning term of his administration should reach its
                            appointed end. Commissioners who had been sent by the new confederacy
                            were already at the capital demanding recognition of its sovereignty and
                            a partition of the national property and domain. The treasury, depleted
                            by robbery and peculation, was exhausted, and the public credit was
                            prostrate.</p>
                        <p>It would be very unjust to the American people to suppose that this
                            singular and unhappy condition of things indicated any extreme favor or
                            toleration of the purpose of a permanent dissolution of the Union. On
                            the contrary, disunion at the very first took on a specious form, and it
                            afterwards made its way by ingenious and seductive devices. It
                            inculcated that the Union is a purely voluntary connexion, founded on
                            the revocable assent of the several States; that secession, in the case
                            of great popular discontent, would induce consultation and
                            reconciliation, and so that revolution, instead of being war, is peace,
                            and disunion, instead of being dissolution, is union. Though the
                            ordinances of secession in the seceding States were carried through
                            impetuously, without deliberation, and even by questionable majorities,
                            yet it was plausibly urged that the citizens who had remained loyal to
                            the Union might wisely acquiesce, so as ultimately to moderate and
                            control the movement, and in any event that if war should ensue, it
                            would become a war of sections, and not a social war, of all others, and
                            especially in those States, the form of war most seriously to be
                            deprecated. It being assumed that peaceful separation is in harmony with
                            the Constitution, it was urged as a consequence that coercion would,
                            therefore, be unlawful and tyrannical; and this principle was even
                            pushed so far as to make the defensive retaining by the federal
                            government of its position within the limits of the seceding States, or
                            where it might seem to overawe or intimidate them, an act of such
                            forbidden coercion. Thus it happened that for a long time, and in very
                            extensive districts even, fidelity to the Union manifested itself by
                            demanding a surrender of its powers and possessions, and compromises
                            with or immunity towards those who were engaged in overthrowing it by
                            armed force. Disunion under these circumstances rapidly matured. On the
                            other hand, the country was bewildered. For the moment even loyal
                            citizens fell naturally into the error of inquiring how the fearful
                            state of things had come about, and who was responsible for it, thus
                            inviting a continuance of the controversy out of which it had arisen,
                            rather than rallying to the duty of arresting it. Disunion, sustained
                            only by passion, made haste to attain its end. Union, on the contrary,
                            required time, because it could only appeal to reason, and reason could
                            not be heard until excitemeut should in some degree subside. Military
                            spirit is an element always ready for revolution. It has a fuller
                            development in the disaffected than in the loyal States. Thousands of
                            men have already banded <pb n="74" xml:id="pg_74" facs="0074"/>
                            themselves as soldiers in the cause of disunion, while the defenders of
                            the Union, before resorting to arms, everywhere wait to make sure that
                            it cannot be otherwise preserved. Even this cautious and pacific, yet
                            patriotic disposition has been misunderstood and perverted by faction to
                            encourage disunion.</p>
                        <p>I believe that I have thus presented the disunion movement
                            dispassionately and without misrepresenting its proportions or its
                            character.</p>
                        <p>You will hardly be asked by responsible statesmen abroad why has not the
                            new administration already suppressed the revolution. Thirty-five days
                            are a short period in which to repress, chiefly by moral means, a
                            movement which is so active while disclosing itself throughout an
                            empire.</p>
                        <p>You will not be expected to promulgate this history, or to communicate it
                            to the British government, but you are entitled to the Presidents views,
                            which I have thus set forth in order to enable you to understand the
                            policy which he proposes to pursue, and to conform your own action to
                            it.</p>
                        <p>The President neither looks for nor apprehends any actual and permanent
                            dismemberment of the American Union, especially by a line of latitude.
                            The improvement of our many channels of intercourse, and the perfection
                            of our scheme of internal exchanges, and the incorporation of both of
                            them into a great system of foreign commerce, concurring with the
                            gradual abatement of the force of the only existing cause of alienation,
                            have carried us already beyond the danger of disunion in that form. The
                            so-called Confederate States, therefore, in the opinion of the
                            President, are attempting what will prove a physical impossibility.
                            Necessarily they build the structure of their new government upon the
                            same principle by which they seek to destroy the Union, namely, the
                            right of each individual member of the confederacy to withdraw from it
                            at pleasure and in peace. A government thus constituted could neither
                            attain the consolidation necessary for stability, nor guaranty any
                            engagements it might make with creditors or other nations. The movement,
                            therefore, in the opinion of the President, tends directly to anarchy in
                            the seceding States, as similar movements in similar circumstances have
                            already resulted in Spanish America, and especially in Mexico. He
                            believes, nevertheless, that the citizens of those States, as well as
                            the citizens of the other States, are too intelligent, considerate, and
                            wise to follow the leaders to that disastrous end. For these reasons he
                            would not be disposed to reject a cardinal dogma of theirs, namely, that
                            the federal government could not reduce the seceding States to obedience
                            by conquest, even although he were disposed to question that
                            proposition. But, in fact, the President willingly accepts it as true.
                            Only an imperial or despotic government could subjugate thoroughly
                            disaffected and insurrectionary members of the State. This federal
                            republican system of ours is of all forms of government the very one
                            which is most unfitted for such a labor. Happily, however, this is only
                            an imaginary defect. The system has within itself adequate, peaceful,
                            conservative, and recuperative forces. Firmness on the part of the
                            government in maintaining and preserving the public institutions and
                            property, and in executing the laws where authority can be exercised
                            without waging war, combined with such measures of justice, moderation,
                            and forbearance as will disarm reasoning opposition, will be sufficient
                            to secure the public safety until returning reflection, concurring with
                            the fearful experience of social evils, the inevitable fruits of
                            faction, shall bring the recusant members cheerfully back into the
                            family, which, after all, must prove their best and happiest, as it
                            undeniably is their most natural home. The Constitution of the United
                            States provides for that return by authorizing Congress, on application
                            to be made by a certain majority of the States, to assemble a national
                            convention, in which <pb n="75" xml:id="pg_75" facs="0075"/> the organic
                            law can, if it be needful, be revised so as to remove all real obstacles
                            to a reunion, so suitable to the habits of the people, and so eminently
                            conducive to the common safety and welfare.</p>
                        <p>Keeping that remedy steadily in view, the President, on the one hand,
                            will not suffer the federal authority to fall into abeyance, nor will
                            he, on the other, aggravate existing evils by attempts at coercion which
                            must assume the form of direct war against any of the revolutionary
                            States. If, while he is pursuing this course, commended as it is by
                            prudence as well as patriotism, the scourge of civil war for the first
                            time in our history must fall upon our country during the term of his
                            administration, that calamity will then have come through the agency,
                            not of the government, but of those who shall have chosen to be its
                            armed, open, and irreconcilable enemies; and he will not suffer himself
                            to doubt that when the value of the imperilled Union shall be brought in
                            that fearful manner home to the business and the bosoms of the American
                            people, they will, with an unanimity that shall vindicate their wisdom
                            and their virtue, rise up and save it.</p>
                        <p>It does not, however, at all surprise the President that the confidence
                            in the stability of the Union, which has been heretofore so universally
                            entertained, has been violently shocked both at home and abroad.
                            Surprise and fear invariably go together. The period of four months
                            which intervened between the election which designated the head of the
                            new administration and its advent, as has already been shown, assumed
                            the character of an interregnum, in which not only were the powers of
                            the government paralyzed, but even its resources seemed to disappear and
                            be forgotten.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, all the world know what are the resources of the United
                            States, and that they are practically unencumbered as well as
                            inexhaustible. It would be easy, if it would not seem invidious, to show
                            that whatever may be the full development of the disunion movement,
                            those resources will not be seriously diminished, and that the revenues
                            and credit of the Union, unsurpassed in any other country, are adequate
                            to every emergency that can occur in our own. Nor will the political
                            commotions which await us sensibly disturb the confidence of the people
                            in the stability of the government. It has been necessary for us to
                            learn, perhaps the instruction has not come too soon, that vicissitudes
                            are incident to our system and our country, as they are to all others.
                            The panic which that instruction naturally produced is nearly past. What
                            has hitherto been most needful for the reinvigoration of authority is
                            already occurring. The aiders, abettors, and sympathizers with disunion,
                            partly by their own choice and partly through the exercise of the public
                            will, are falling out from the civil departments of the government as
                            well as from the army and the navy. The national legislature will no
                            longer be a distracted council. Our representatives in foreign courts
                            and ports will henceforth speak only the language of loyalty to their
                            country, and of confidence in its institutions and its destiny.</p>
                        <p>It is much to be deplored that our representatives are to meet abroad
                            agents of disunion, seeking foreign aid to effect what, unaided, is
                            already seen to be desperate. You need not be informed that their
                            success in Great Britain would probably render their success easy
                            elsewhere. The President does not doubt that you fully appreciate the
                            responsibility of your mission. An honored ancestor of yours was the
                            first to represent your whole country, after its independence was
                            established, at the same court to which you now are accredited. The
                            President feels assured that it will happen through no want of loyalty
                            or of diligence on your part if you are to be the last to discharge that
                            trust. You will have this great advantage, that from the hour when that
                            country, so dear to us all, first challenged the notice of nations,
                            until now, it has continually grown in their sympathy and reverence.</p>
                        <pb n="76" xml:id="pg_76" facs="0076"/>
                        <p>Before considering the arguments you are to use, it is important to
                            indidicate those which you are not to employ in executing that
                            mission:</p>
                        <p>First. The President has noticed, as the whole American people have, with
                            much emotion, the expressions of good will and friendship toward the
                            United States, and of concern for their present embarrassments, which
                            have been made on apt occasions by her Majesty and her ministers. You
                            will make due acknowledgment for these manifestations, but at the same
                            time you will not rely on any mere sympathies or national kindness. You
                            will make no admissions of weakness in our Constitution, or of
                            apprehension on the part of the government. You will rather prove, as
                            you easily can, by comparing the history of our country with that of
                            other states, that its Constitution and government are really the
                            strongest and surest which have ever been erected for the safety of any
                            people. You will in no case listen to any suggestions of compromise by
                            this government, under foreign auspices, with its discontented citizens.
                            If, as the President does not at all apprehend, you shall unhappily find
                            her Majesty’s government tolerating the application of the so-called
                            seceding States, or wavering about it, you will not leave them to
                            suppose for a moment that they can grant that application and remain the
                            friends of the United States. You may even assure them promptly in that
                            case that if they determine to recognize, they may at the same time
                            prepare to enter into alliance with the enemies of this republic. You
                            alone will represent your country at London, and you will represent the
                            whole of it there. When you are asked to divide that duty with others,
                            diplomatic relations between the government of Great Britain and this
                            government will be suspended, and will remain so until it shall be seen
                            which of the two is most strongly entrenched in the confidence of their
                            respective nations and of mankind.</p>
                        <p>You will not be allowed, however, even if you were disposed, as the
                            President is sure you will not be, to rest your opposition to the
                            application of the Confederate States on the ground of any favor this
                            administration, or the party which chiefly called it into existence,
                            proposes to show to Great Britain, or claims that Great Britain ought to
                            show to them. You will not consent to draw into debate before the
                            British government any opposing moral principles which may be supposed
                            to lie at the foundation of the controversy between those States and the
                            federal Union.</p>
                        <p>You will indulge in no expressions of harshness or disrespect, or even
                            impatience, concerning the seceding States, their agents, or their
                            people. But you will, on the contrary, all the while remember that those
                            States are now, as they always heretofore have been, and,
                            notwithstanding their temporary self-delusion, they must always continue
                            to be, equal and honored members of this federal Union, and that their
                            citizens throughout all political misunderstandings and alienations
                            still are and always must be our kindred and countrymen. In short, all
                            your arguments must belong to one of three classes, namely: First.
                            Arguments drawn from the principles of public law and natural justice,
                            which regulate the intercourse of equal States. Secondly. Arguments
                            which concern equally the honor, welfare, and happiness of the
                            discontented States, and the honor, welfare, and happiness of the whole
                            Union. Thirdly. Arguments which are equally conservative of the rights
                            and interests, and even sentiments of the United States, and just in
                            their bearing upon the rights, interests, and sentiments of Great
                            Britain and all other nations.</p>
                        <p>We freely admit that a nation may, and even ought, to recognize a new
                            State which has absolutely and beyond question effected its
                            independence, and permanently established its sovereignty; and that a
                            recognition in such a case affords no just cause of offence to the
                            government of the country <pb n="77" xml:id="pg_77" facs="0077"/> from
                            which the new State has so detached itself. On the other hand, we insist
                            that a nation that recognizes a revolutionary State, with a view to aid
                            its effecting its sovereignty and independence, commits a great wrong
                            against the nation whose integrity is thus invaded, and makes itself
                            responsible for a just and ample redress.</p>
                        <p>I will not stop to inquire whether it may not sometimes happen that an
                            imperial government or even a federative one may not so oppress or
                            aggrieve its subjects in a province or in a State as to justify
                            intervention on the plea of humanity. Her Majesty’s government, however,
                            will not make a pretence that the present is such a case. The United
                            States have existed under their present form of government seventy and
                            more years, and during all that time not one human life has been taken
                            in forfeiture for resistance to their authority. It must be the verdict
                            of history that no government so just, so equal, and so humane, has ever
                            elsewhere existed. Even the present disunion movement is confessedly
                            without any better cause than an apprehension of dangers which, from the
                            very nature of the government, are impossible; and speculations of
                            aggressions, which those who know the physical and social arrangements
                            of this continent must see at once are fallacious and chimerical.</p>
                        <p>The disunionists will, I am sure, take no such ground. They will appeal,
                            not to the justice, or to the magnanimity, but to the cupidity and
                            caprice of Great Britain.</p>
                        <p>It cannot need many words to show that even in that form their appeal
                            ought to be promptly dismissed. I am aware that the revenue law lately
                            passed by Congress is vehemently denounced in Great Britain. It might be
                            enough to say on that subject that as the United States and Great
                            Britain are equals in dignity, and not unequal in astuteness in the
                            science and practice of political economy, the former have good right to
                            regard only their own convenience, and consult their own judgment in
                            framing their revenue laws. But there are some points in this connexion
                            which you may make without compromising the self-respect of this
                            government.</p>
                        <p>In the circumstances of the present case, it is clear that a recognition
                            of the so-called Confederate nations must be deemed equivalent to a
                            deliberate resolution by her Majesty’s government that this American
                            Union, which has so long constituted a sovereign nation, shall be now
                            permanently dissolved, and cease to exist forever. The excuse for this
                            resolution, fraught, if effectual, with fearful and enduring
                            consequences, is a change in its revenue laws—a change which, because of
                            its very nature, as well as by reason of the ever-changing course of
                            public sentiment, must necessarily be temporary and ephemeral. British
                            censors tell us that the new tariff is unwise for ourselves. If so, it
                            will speedily be repealed. They say it is illiberal and injurious to
                            Great Britain. It cannot be so upon her principles without being also
                            injurious to ourselves, and in that case it will be promptly repealed.
                            Besides, there certainly are other and more friendly remedies for
                            foreign legislation that is injurious without premeditated purpose of
                            injury, which a magnanimous government will try before it deliberately
                            seeks the destruction of the offended nation.</p>
                        <p>The application of the so-called Confederate States, in the aspect now
                            under consideration, assumes that they are offering, or will offer, more
                            liberal commercial facilities than the United States can or will be
                            disposed to concede. Would it not be wise for Great Britain to wait
                            until those liberal facilities shall be definitely fixed and offered by
                            the Confederate States, and then to wait further and see whether the
                            United States may not accord facilities not less desirable?</p>
                        <p>The union of these States seventy years ago established perfectly free
                                <pb n="78" xml:id="pg_78" facs="0078"/> trade between the several
                            States, and this, in effect, is free trade throughout the largest
                            inhabitable part of North America. During all that time, with occasional
                            and very brief intervals, not affecting the result, we have been
                            constantly increasing in commercial liberality towards foreign nations.
                            We have made that advance necessarily, because, with increasing
                            liberality, we have at the same time, owing to controlling causes,
                            continually augmented our revenues and increased our own productions.
                            The sagacity of the British government cannot allow it to doubt that our
                            natural course hereafter in this respect must continue to be the same as
                            heretofore.</p>
                        <p>The same sagacity may be trusted to decide, first, whether the so-called
                            Confederate States, on the emergency of a military revolution, and
                            having no other sources of revenue than duties on imports and exports
                            levied within the few ports they can command without a naval force, are
                            likely to be able to persevere in practicing the commercial liberality
                            they proffer as an equivalent for recognition. Manifestly, moreover, the
                            negotiation which they propose to open with Great Britain implies that
                            peace is to be preserved while the new commerce goes on. The sagacity of
                            her Majesty’s government may be trusted to consider whether that new
                            government is likely to be inaugurated without war, and whether the
                            commerce of Great Britain with this country would be likely to be
                            improved by flagrant war between the southern and northern States.</p>
                        <p>Again, even a very limited examination of commercial statistics will be
                            sufficient to show that while the staples of the disaffected States do,
                            indeed, as they claim, constitute a very important portion of the
                            exports of the United States to European countries, a very large portion
                            of the products and fabrics of other regions consumed in those States
                            are derived, and must continue to be derived, not from Europe, but from
                            the northern States, while the chief consumption of European productions
                            and fabrics imported into the United States takes place in these same
                            States. Great Britain may, if her government think best, by modifying
                            her navigation laws, try to change these great, features of American
                            commerce; but it will require something more than acts of the British
                            Parliament and of the proposed revolutionary Congress to modify a
                            commerce that takes its composite character from all the various soils
                            and climates of a continent, as well as from the diversified
                            institutions, customs and dispositions of the many communities which
                            inhabit it.</p>
                        <p>Once more: All the speculations which assume that the revenue law
                            recently passed by Congress will diminish the consumption of foreign
                            fabrics and productions in the United States are entirely erroneous. The
                            American people are active, industrious, inventive, and energetic, but
                            they are not penurious or sordid. They are engaged with wonderful effect
                            in developing the mineral, forest, agricultural and pastoral resources
                            of a vast and, practically, new continent. Their wealth, individual as
                            well as public, increases every day in a general sense, irrespective of
                            the revenue laws of the United States, and every day also the habit of
                            liberal—not to say profuse—expenditure grows upon them. There are
                            changes in the nature and character of imported productions which they
                            consume, but practically no decline in the quantity and value of
                            imports.</p>
                        <p>It remains to bring out distinctly a consideration to which I have
                            already adverted. Great Britain has within the last forty-five years
                            changed character and purpose. She has become a power for production,
                            rather than a power for destruction. She is committed, as it seems to
                            us, to a policy of industry, not of ambition; a policy of peace, not of
                            war. One has only to compare her present domestic condition with that of
                            any former period to see that this new career on which she has entered
                            is as wise as it is <pb n="79" xml:id="pg_79" facs="0079"/> humane and
                            beneficent. Her success in this career requires peace throughout the
                            civilized world, and nowhere so much as on this continent. Recognition
                            by her of the so-called Confederate States would be intervention and war
                            in this country. Permanent dismemberment of the American Union in
                            consequence of that intervention would be perpetual war—civil war. The
                            new confederacy which in that case Great Britain would have aided into
                            existence must, like any other new state, seek to expand itself
                            northward, westward, and southward. What part of this continent or of
                            the adjacent islands would be expected to remain in peace?</p>
                        <p>The President would regard it as inconsistent with his habitually high
                            consideration for the government and people of Great Britain to allow me
                            to dwell longer on the merely commercial aspects of the question under
                            discussion. Indeed he will not for a moment believe that, upon
                            consideration of merely financial gain, that government could be induced
                            to lend its aid to a revolution designed to overthrow the institutions
                            of this country, and involving ultimately the destruction of the
                            liberties of the American people.</p>
                        <p>To recognize the independence of a new state, and so favor, possibly
                            determine, its admission into the family of nations, is the highest
                            possible exercise of sovereign power, because it affects in any case the
                            welfare of two nations, and often the peace of the world. In the
                            European system this power is now seldom attempted to be exercised
                            without invoking a consultation or congress of nations. That system has
                            not been extended to this continent. But there is even a greater
                            necessity for prudence in such cases in regard to American States than
                            in regard to the nations of Europe. A revolutionary change of dynasty,
                            or even a disorganization and recombination of one or many States,
                            therefore, do not long or deeply affect the general interests of
                            society, because the ways of trade and habits of society remain the
                            same. But a radical change effected in the political combinations
                            existing on the continent, followed, as it probably would be, by moral
                            convulsions of incalculable magnitude, would threaten the stability of
                            society throughout the world.</p>
                        <p>Humanity has indeed little to hope for if it shall, in this age of high
                            improvement, be decided without a trial that the principle of
                            international law which regards nations as moral persons, bound so to
                            act as to do to each other the least injury and the most good, is merely
                            an abstraction too refined to be reduced into practice by the
                            enlightened nations of Western Europe. Seen in the light of this
                            principle, the several nations of the earth constitute one great federal
                            republic. When one of them casts its suffrages for the admission of a
                            new member into that republic, it ought to act under a profound sense of
                            moral obligation, and be governed by considerations as pure,
                            disinterested, and elevated as the general interest of society and the
                            advancement of human nature.</p>
                        <p>The British empire itself is an aggregation of divers communities which
                            cover a large portion of the earth and embrace one-fifth of its entire
                            population. Some, at least, of these communities are held to their
                            places in that system by bonds as fragile as the obligations of our own
                            federal Union. The strain will some time come which is to try the
                            strength of these bonds, though it will be of a different kind from that
                            which is trying the cords of our confederation. Would it be wise for her
                            Majesty’s government, on this occasion, to set a dangerous precedent, or
                            provoke retaliation? If Scotland and Ireland are at last reduced to
                            quiet contentment, has Great Britain no dependency, island, or province
                            left exposed along the whole circle of her empire, from Gibraltar
                            through the West Indies and Canada till it begins again on the southern
                            extremity of Africa?</p>
                        <pb n="80" xml:id="pg_80" facs="0080"/>
                        <p>The President will not dwell on the pleasing recollection that Great
                            Britain, not yet a year ago, manifested by marked attention to the
                            United States her desire for a cordial reunion which, all ancient
                            prejudices and passions being buried, should be a pledge of mutual
                            interest and sympathy forever thereafter. The United States are not
                            indifferent to the circumstances of common descent, language, customs,
                            sentiments, and religion, which recommend a closer sympathy between
                            themselves and Great Britain than either might expect in its intercourse
                            with any other nation. The United States are one of many nations which
                            have sprung from Great Britain herself. Other such nations are rising up
                            in various parts of the globe. It has been thought by many who have
                            studied the philosophy of modern history profoundly, that the success of
                            the nations thus deriving their descent from Great Britain might,
                            through many ages, reflect back upon that kingdom the proper glories of
                            its own great career. The government and people of Great Britain may
                            mistake their commercial interests, but they cannot become either
                            unnatural or indifferent to the impulses of an undying ambition to be
                            distinguished as the leaders of the nations in the ways of civilization
                            and humanity.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have recently had the honor to receive
                            your despatches, numbered 304 and 305.</p>
                        <p>Having noticed that the despatch No. 304, bearing date the 28th of
                            February, respecting the newly-formed confederacy of seceded States, was
                            in harmony as well with the views enunciated in the inaugural address on
                            the 4th instant as with those of the presidential message of December
                            last, I lost no time in seeking an interview with her Majesty’s
                            principal secretary of state for foreign affairs, and in stating the
                            opposition which I am in that despatch instructed to make to any
                            recognition by the Queen of England of the independence of those who
                            have thus attempted to throw off their federal obligations.</p>
                        <p>The necessary opportunity was accorded to me on the day after the receipt
                            of the despatch, yesterday. Lord John Russell then listened to the
                            communication as one he expected; though on its purport the British
                            cabinet, if they had interchanged opinions at all, had reached no
                            definite conclusion as to their proper course of action.</p>
                        <p>I took the liberty to inquire whether any one professing to represent the
                            southern republic had approached this government on the subject, and his
                            lordship, with prompt frankness, assured me that he felt no hesitation
                            in answering in the negative, adding that he had been shown a private
                            letter from which he inferred that accredited ministers or
                            commissioners, authorized to negotiate for the recognition, would
                            shortly be sent by the provisional authorities of Montgomery.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your despatches, numbered 306 and 307, and a circular, dated
                            the 9th of March, 1861, respecting the probable efforts of persons
                            claiming to represent a southern provisional government to obtain the
                            recognition of their independence by Great Britain.</p>
                        <p>Respecting this last-mentioned subject, I addressed yesterday, as soon as
                            your instruction was received, a note to her Majesty’s principal
                            secretary of state for foreign affairs requesting an early interview,
                            deeming it not impossible that I might be enabled to send you something
                            by this steamer. My note, however, is yet unanswered, owing, I presume,
                            to the absence of Lord John Russell from town. The commissioners from
                            the new confederacy have not yet arrived, and may not arrive until late
                            in this month. You were apprised by my despatch of the 22d ultimo (No.
                            325) that, on the receipt from the department of your predecessors, No.
                            304, I had lost no time in placing the matter properly before this
                            government. Your own views will be communicated in greater fullness when
                            the opportunity is allowed me.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to my despatch of the 5th
                            instant, (No. 329,) I have now the honor to state that Lord John Russell
                            accorded me an interview at the foreign office yesterday, and enabled me
                            to submit fully to his consideration the representations of your
                            circular, with the inaugural address of the President.</p>
                        <p>We conversed for some time on the question of recognizing the alleged
                            southern confederacy, of which no representative has yet appeared, and
                            may not appear until the end of the month.</p>
                        <p>His lordship assured me with great earnestness that there was not the
                            slightest disposition in the British government to grasp at any
                            advantage which might be supposed to arise from the unpleasant domestic
                            differences in the United States, but, on the contrary, that they would
                            be highly gratified if those differences were adjusted and the Union
                            restored to its former unbroken position.</p>
                        <p>I pressed upon him, in concluding, if that were the case—and I was quite
                            convinced that it was—how important it must be that this country and
                            France should abstain, at least for a considerable time, from doing
                            what, by encouraging groundless hopes, would widen a breach still
                            thought capable of being closed.</p>
                        <p>He seemed to think the matter not ripe for decision one way or the other,
                                <pb n="82" xml:id="pg_82" facs="0082"/> and remarked that what he
                            had said was all that at present it was in his power to say. The coming
                            of my successor, Mr. Adams, looked for from week to week, would
                            doubtless be regarded as the appropriate and natural occasion for
                            finally discussing and determining the question. In the intermediate
                            time whatever of vigilance and activity may be necessary shall, of
                            course, and as a high duty, be exerted.</p>
                        <p>English opinion tends rather, I apprehend, to the theory that a peaceful
                            separation may work beneficially for both groups of States and not
                            injuriously affect the rest of the world. They cannot be expected to
                            appreciate the weakness, discredit, complications, and dangers which we
                            instinctively and justly ascribe to disunion.</p>
                        <p>I beg to add that a phase of this subject will be introduced in the House
                            of Commons to-night by Lord Alfred Churchill, and that on the 15th
                            instant a motion favoring the recognition will be pressed by Mr. W. H.
                            Gregory, member for Galway.</p>

                                of her Majesty’s government to invite a conference of the European
                                powers on the subject, so as to prevent the African slave trade
                                being reopened or carried on under the flag of the said

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: A despatch has just been received from Mr.
                            Dallas, dated the 9th of April instant, the record of which (No. 330)
                            you doubtless will find in the archives of the legation when you shall
                            have arrived at London.</p>
                        <pb n="83" xml:id="pg_83" facs="0083"/>
                        <p>In that paper Mr. Dallas states that he had had a conversation with Lord
                            John Russell, the minister of foreign affairs of her Britannic Majesty’s
                            government, on the subject of a protest against any recognition of the
                            so-called Confederate States of America, the protest having been
                            presented to him by Mr. Dallas, in obedience to a circular letter of
                            instructions sent to him from this department, under the date of the 9th
                            ultimo.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Dallas represents that his lordship assured him, with great
                            earnestness, that there was not the slightest disposition in the British
                            government to grasp at any advantage which might be supposed to arise
                            from the unpleasant domestic differences in the United States; but, on
                            the contrary, that they would be highly gratified if those differences
                            were adjusted, and the Union restored to its former unbroken
                            position.</p>
                        <p>This, by itself, would be very gratifying to the President. Mr. Dallas,
                            however, adds that he endeavored to impress upon his lordship how
                            important it must be that Great Britain and France should abstain, at
                            least for a considerable time, from doing what, by encouraging
                            groundless hopes, would widen a breach still thought capable of being
                            closed; but that his lordshid seemed to think the matter not ripe for
                            decision one way or the other, and remarked that what he had already
                            said was all that at present it was in his power to say.</p>
                        <p>When you shall have read the instructions at large which have been sent
                            to you, you will hardly need to be told that these last remarks of his
                            lordship are by no means satisfactory to this government. Her Britannic
                            Majesty’s government is at liberty to choose whether it will retain the
                            friendship of this government by refusing all aid and comfort to its
                            enemies, now in flagrant rebellion against it, as we think the treaties
                            existing between the two countries require, or whether the government of
                            her Majesty will take the precarious benefits of a different course.</p>
                        <p>You will lose no time in making known to her Britannic Majesty’s
                            government that the President regards the answer of his lordship as
                            possibly indicating a policy that this government would be obliged to
                            deem injurious to its rights and derogating from its dignity.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In my No. 329 I mentioned having received
                            your Nos. 306 and 307, and “a circular of the 9th of March, 1861.” As I
                            have got no despatch from you, numbered 308, it is probable that this
                            “circular” was considered at the department as representing that number
                            in the series. I have now to acknowledge your several despatches,
                            numbered, respectively, 309, 310, 311, and 312, whose contents have had
                            my careful and prompt attention.</p>
                        <p>You have doubtless noticed that the motion of Mr. Gregory, in the House
                            of Commons, on the recognition of the southern confederation—which
                            motion I mentioned at the conclusion of my No. 330—underwent
                            postponement from the 16th to the 30th ultimo, and has again been
                            deferred a fortnight, for the reasons stated in the extract from the
                            “Times” newspaper of the 30th April, hereto annexed.</p>

                        <p>The solicitude felt by Lord John Russell as to the effect of certain
                            measures represented as likely to be adopted by the President induced
                            him to request me to call at his private residence yesterday. I did so.
                            He told me that the three representatives of the southern confederacy
                            were here; that he had not seen them, but was not unwilling to do so,
                                <hi rend="italic">unofficially;</hi> that there existed an
                            understanding between this government and that of France which would
                            lead both to take the same course as to recognition, whatever that
                            course might be; and he then referred to the rumor of a meditated
                            blockade of southern ports and their discontinuance as ports of
                            entry—topics on which I had heard nothing, and could therefore say
                            nothing. But as I informed him that Mr. Adams had apprised me of his
                            intention to be on his way hither, in the steamship “Niagara,” which
                            left Boston on the 1st May, and that he would probably arrive in less
                            than two weeks, by the 12th or 15th instant, his lordship acquiesced in
                            the expediency of disregarding mere rumor, and waiting the full
                            knowledge to be brought by my successor.</p>
                        <p>The motion, therefore, of Mr. Gregory may be further postponed, at his
                            lordship’s suggestion.</p>

                                opinion of the foreign secretary, who had informed him that a
                                discussion at the present moment upon the expediency of a prompt
                                recognition of the southern confederation of America would be
                                embarrassing to the public service, and in deference; also, to the
                                wishes of several honorable friends of his, he should postpone for a
                                fortnight the motion which stood in his name for to-morrow night.
                                The noble lord at the head of the foreign office believed that the

                                    Letters of Marque</hi>.—Mr. J. Ewart asked the secretary of
                                state for foreign affairs whether, seeing the possibility of
                                privateering being permitted and encouraged by the southern
                                confederation of the States of America, her Majesty’s government had
                                placed a sufficient naval force, or intended to increase it, in the
                                Gulf of Mexico, with a view to protect British shipping and British
                                property on board of American ships; and if privateers, sailing
                                under the flag of an unrecognized power, would be dealt with as
                                pirates.</p>
                            <p>Lord J. Russell said: In answer to the first part of the question of
                                the honorable gentleman, I beg to say that her Majesty’s government
                                has directed that a naval force, for the protection of British
                                shipping, should be sent to the coast of America. As to the latter
                                part of the question, I will state to the house that the government
                                has, from day to day, received the most lamentable accounts of the
                                progress of the war in the States of America. Her Majesty’s
                                government heard the other day that the Confederated States have
                                issued letters of marque; and to-day we have heard that it is
                                intended there shall be a blockade of all the ports of the southern
                                States. As to the <pb n="85" xml:id="pg_85" facs="0085"/> general
                                provisions of the law of nations on these questions, some of the
                                points are so new as well as so important that they have been
                                referred to the law officers of the crown for their opinion in order
                                to guide the government in its instructions both to the English
                                minister in America and the commander of the naval squadron. Her
                                Majesty’s government has felt that it was its duty to use every
                                possible means to avoid taking any part in the lamentable contest
                                now raging in the American States. (Hear, hear.) And nothing but the
                                imperative duty of protecting British interests, in case they should
                                be attacked, justifies the government in at all interfering. We have
                                not been involved in any way in that contest by any act or giving
                                any advice in the matter, and, for God’s sake, let us if possible
                                keep out of it! (Cheers.)</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the satisfaction to announce my
                            safe arrival at this place on Monday evening, the 13th of this month.
                            The steamer reached Liverpool at eleven in the morning, where I was
                            received with the utmost kindness, and strongly solicited to remain at
                            least one day. A large deputation of the American Chamber of Commerce
                            waited upon me and delivered an address, to which I made a brief reply.
                            Both have been printed in the newspapers, and I transmit a copy of the
                            Times containing them. I could not fail to observe, in the course of
                            these proceedings, the great anxiety and the fluctuating sentiment that
                            prevail in regard to the probable issue of affairs in America. I could
                            also perceive that my arrival had been expected with far more solicitude
                            than I had anticipated. It was not disguised from me that a supposed
                            community of interest in the cotton culture was weighing heavily in that
                            city in favor of the disaffected; and that much misapprehension
                            prevailed as to the relative position of parties in the United States,
                            which it was of some consequence to dispel. To this end it had been the
                            wish that I could have found it convenient to make a longer stay in the
                            place.</p>
                        <p>Under other circumstances I might have so far deferred to these
                            representations as to delay my departure for twenty-four hours. But, on
                            the other hand, some incidental allusions to the state of things in
                            London convinced me of the importance of losing no time on my way.
                            Accordingly I took the next train in the afternoon, and was in a
                            condition to proceed at once to business on the morning of Tuesday, the
                            14th. In the interval between my departure from Boston on the 1st and my
                            arrival on the 14th, I discovered that some events had taken place
                            deserving of attention. The agents of the so-called Confederate States
                            had arrived, and, as it is supposed, through their instigation certain
                            inquiries and motions had been initiated in Parliament for the purpose
                            of developing the views of the ministry in regard to American affairs. I
                            allude more particularly to the questions proposed by Mr. Gregory, of
                            Galway, and to the motion of Mr. Horsfall, the member for Liverpool,
                            touching the effect of the blockade proclaimed by the President against
                            the southern ports. The answer given by Lord John Russell, in the
                            proceedings of the 6th of May, will, of course, have attracted your
                            attention long before these lines meet your eye. I need <pb n="86"
                                xml:id="pg_86" facs="0086"/> not say that it excited general
                            surprise, especially among those most friendly to the government of the
                            United States. There seemed to be not a little precipitation in at once
                            raising the disaffected States up to the level of a belligerent power,
                            before it had developed a single one of the real elements which
                            constitute military efficiency outside of its geographical limits. The
                            case of the Greeks was by no means a parallel case, for the declaration
                            had not been made until such time had intervened as was necessary to
                            prove, by the very words quoted by Lord John Russell from the
                            instructions of the British government, that the power was sufficient
                            “to cover the sea with its cruisers.” Whereas in the present instance
                            there was no evidence to show as yet the existence of a single privateer
                            afloat. The inference seemed almost inevitable that there existed a
                            disposition at least not to chill the hopes of those who are now drawing
                            the very breath of life only from the expectation of sympathy in Great
                            Britain. Yet I am not quite prepared to say that there is just ground
                            for the idea. On the contrary, I am led to believe, from the incidental
                            discussion afterwards held in both houses, as well as from other
                            information, that the language of Lord John Russell was viewed as not
                            altogether sufficiently guarded, and that the ministry as a whole are
                            not prepared to countenance any such conclusion.</p>
                        <p>There are still other reasons which occasion in me great surprise at the
                            action of his lordship. I need not say that I was received by my
                            predecessor, Mr. Dallas, with the greatest kindness and cordiality. I
                            immediately learned from him that he had declined himself to enter into
                            any discussions on the subject, because he knew that I was already on my
                            way out, and that I should probably come fully possessed of the views of
                            my government, and ready to communicate them freely to the authorities
                            here. To this end he had already concerted with Lord John Russell the
                            earliest possible measures for my presentation and for a conference with
                            him. In regard to the ceremony, there were circumstances attending it
                            which, in the precise posture of affairs, give it some significance. * *
                            On Tuesday morning Mr. Dallas called on me to accompany him on his visit
                            to Lord John Russell, at his house, at eleven o’clock. Great was our
                            disappointment, however, to find that he had been suddenly called away,
                            at an early hour, to visit his brother, the Duke of Bedford, at Woburn
                            Abbey, who was very ill, and who actually died at two o’clock in the
                            afternoon of that day. This, of course, has put an end to all further
                            communication with him for the present. I very much regretted this
                            circumstance, as I should have been glad to converse with him prior to
                            the final action upon the proclamation which was adopted by the Privy
                            Council, and which was issued in the Gazette on the very same day. A
                            copy of that proclamation is to be found in the Times of the 15th of
                            May, the same paper which I have already desired to transmit for another
                            purpose. I submit it to your consideration without comment.</p>
                        <p>Feeling doubtful how the informal arrangement of Lord John Russell might
                            have been affected by his sudden departure, I at once addressed to him
                            the customary announcement of my arrival, and a request for an audience
                            of her Majesty at an early day. This brought me immediate replies from
                            the minister and from his secretary, Mr. Hammond, confirming the
                            appointment of Thursday (yesterday) as the time for my presentation,
                            while the latter gentleman notified me that in the absence of Lord John
                            Russell Lord Palmerston would be in waiting at the palace at three
                            o’clock to present me. At the same time Mr. Dallas received a similar
                            notification, appointing the same hour and place for his audience of
                            leave. This arrangement was fully carried out yesterday according to the
                            programme. Mr. Dallas was introduced first, and took his leave, after
                            which I presented my credentials, with a few words expressive of the
                            desire of my government to <pb n="87" xml:id="pg_87" facs="0087"/>
                            maintain the friendly relations existing between the two countries; and
                            thus I became the recognized minister.</p>
                        <p>Thus an end is put to all the speculations which have been set afloat in
                            some quarters for interested purposes touching the probable position of
                            the minister of the United States at this court. I might add, that so
                            far I have every reason to be fully satisfied with the reception which I
                            have met with from everybody. Fortunately the news which came from the
                            United States by the same steamer which brought me was calculated to
                            dispel many of the illusions that had been industriously elaborated
                            during the period of isolation of the city of Washington, and to
                            confirm, the faith of those who had permitted themselves to doubt
                            whether all government in the United States was of any more cohesiveness
                            than a rope of sand. Yet I cannot say that the public opinion is yet
                            exactly what we would wish it. Much depends upon the course of things in
                            the United States, and the firmness and energy made visible in the
                            direction of affairs.</p>
                        <p>The morning papers contain a report of the debate in the House of Lords
                            on the Queen’s proclamation, to which I beg to call your particular
                            attention. I cannot say that the tone of it is generally such as I could
                            wish. There is undoubtedly a considerable influence at work here both in
                            and out of the ministry which must be met and counteracted at as early a
                            moment as practicable. Mr. Gregory yesterday gave notice of a
                            postponement of the consideration of his motion until the 7th of June.
                            The reason assigned is the situation of Lord John Russell. * * The same
                            cause, however, which postpones this debate also delays my opportunities
                            of conference with the minister. My wish has been to confer with him
                            rather than with any of the subordinates, for reasons which will readily
                            occur to you. Next week come the Whitsuntide holidays, and the
                            adjournment of Parliament for ten days, during which little can be done
                            with effect. I propose, nevertheless, at once to apply for a conference
                            at as early a period as possible.</p>
                        <p>I have just received a visit from a Mr. Arrowsmith, who came on behalf of
                            Mr. Cunard’s Steamship Company, to know whether the government would
                            desire any number of their steam vessels to further their operations of
                            blockade. I said, in reply, that I had no instructions on that point,
                            and could give no information, but that I was now writing and would
                            communicate the proposal. Mr. Arrowsmith says that fifteen or twenty
                            vessels could be furnished at a moment’s notice, which, by preparations
                            of cotton pressed between decks, could be made to sustain guns, and thus
                            be efficient instruments in closing the southern ports.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Dallas, in a brief despatch of May 2, (No. 333,) tells us that Lord
                            John Russell recently requested an interview with him on account of the
                            solicitude which his lordship felt concerning the effect of certain
                            measures represented as likely to be adopted by the President. In that
                            conversation the British secretary told Mr. Dallas that the three
                            representatives of the southern confederacy were then in London, that
                            Lord John Russell had not yet seen them, but that he was not unwilling
                            to see them unofficially. He further informed Mr. Dallas that an
                            understanding exists between the British and French governments which
                            would lead both to take one and the same course as to recognition. His
                            lordship then referred to the rumor of a meditated blockade by us of
                            southern ports, and a discontinuance of them as ports of entry. Mr.
                            Dallas answered that he knew nothing on those topics, and therefore
                            could say nothing. He added that you were expected to arrive in two
                            weeks. Upon this statement Lord John Russell acquiesced in the
                            expediency of waiting for the full knowledge you were, expected to
                            bring.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Dallas transmitted to us some newspaper reports of ministeríal
                            explanations made in Parliament.</p>
                        <p>You will base no proceedings on parliamentary debates further than to
                            seek explanations, when necessary, and communicate them to this
                            department.</p>
                        <p>The President regrets that Mr. Dallas did not protest against the
                            proposed unofficial intercourse between the British government and the
                            missionaries of the insurgents. It is due, however, to Mr. Dallas to say
                            that our instructions had been given only to you and not to him, and
                            that his loyalty and fidelity, too rare in these times, are
                            appreciated.</p>
                        <p>Intercourse of any kind with the so-called commissioners is liable to be
                            construed as a recognition of the authority which appointed them. Such
                            intercourse would be none the less hurtful to us for being called
                            unofficial, and it might be even more injurious, because we should have
                            no means of knowing what points might be resolved by it. Moreover,
                            unofficial intercourse is useless and meaningless if it is not expected
                            to ripen into official intercourse and direct recognition. It is left
                            doubtful here whether the proposed unofficial intercourse has yet
                            actually begun. Your own antecedent instructions are deemed explicit
                            enough, and it is hoped that you have not misunderstood them. You will,
                            in any event, desist from all intercourse whatever, unofficial as well
                            as official, with the British government, so long as it shall continue
                            intercourse of either kind with the domestic enemies of this country.
                            When intercourse shall have been arrested for this cause, you will
                            communicate with this department and receive further directions.</p>
                        <p>Lord John Russell has informed us of an understanding between the British
                            and French governments that they will act together in regard to our
                            affairs. This communication, however, loses something of its value from
                            the circumstance that the communication was withheld until after
                            knowledge of the fact had been acquired by us from other sources. We
                            know also another fact that has not yet been officially communicated to
                            us, namely: That other European states are apprized by France and
                            England <pb n="89" xml:id="pg_89" facs="0089"/> of their agreement, and
                            are expected to concur with or follow them in whatever measures they
                            adopt on the subject of recognition. The United States have been
                            impartial and just in all their conduct towards the several nations of
                            Europe. They will not complain, however, of the combination now
                            announced by the two leading powers, although they think they had a
                            right to expect a more independent, if not a more friendly course, from
                            each of them. You will take no notice of that or any other alliance.
                            Whenever the European governments shall see fit to communicate directly
                            with us, we shall be, as heretofore, frank and explicit in our
                            reply.</p>
                        <p>As to the blockade, you will say that by our own laws and the laws of
                            nature, and the laws of nations, this government has a clear right to
                            suppress insurrection. An exclusion of commerce from national ports
                            which have been seized by insurgents, in the equitable form of blockade,
                            is a proper means to that end. You will not insist that our blockade is
                            to be respected, if it be not maintained by a competent force; but
                            passing by that question as not now a practical or at least an urgent
                            one, you will add that the blockade is now, and it will continue to be,
                            so maintained, and therefore we expect it to be respected by Great
                            Britain. You will add that we have already revoked the exequatur of a
                            Russian consul who had enlisted in the military service of the
                            insurgents, and we shall dismiss or demand the recall of every foreign
                            agent, consular or diplomatic, who shall either disobey the federal laws
                            or disown the federal authority.</p>
                        <p>As to the recognition of the so-called Southern Confederacy, it is not to
                            be made a subject of technical definition. It is, of course, direct
                            recognition to publish an acknowledgment of the sovereignty and
                            independence of a new power. It is direct recognition to receive its
                            embassadors, ministers, agents or commissioners, officially. A
                            concession of belligerent rights is liable to be construed as a
                            recognition of them. No one of these proceedings will pass unquestioned
                            by the United States in this case.</p>
                        <p>Hitherto, recognition has been moved only on the assumption that the
                            so-called Confederate States are <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> a
                            self-sustaining power. Now, after long forbearance, designed to sooth
                            discontent and avert the need of civil war, the land and naval forces of
                            the United States have been put in motion to repress insurrection. The
                            true character of the pretended new State is at once revealed. It is
                            seen to be a power existing in pronunciamento only. It has never won a
                            field. It has obtained no forts that were not virtually betrayed into
                            its hands or seized in breach of trust. It commands not a single port on
                            the coast nor any highway out from its pretended capital by land. Under
                            these circumstances, Great Britain is called upon to intervene and give
                            it body and independence by resisting our measures of suppression.
                            British recognition would be British intervention, to create within our
                            territory a hostile State by overthrowing this republic itself.</p>
                        <p rend="center">* * * * * * * *</p>
                        <p>As to the treatment of privateers in the insurgent service, you will say
                            that this is a question exclusively our own. We treat them as pirates.
                            They are our own citizens, or persons employed by our citizens, preying
                            on the commerce of our country. If Great Britain shall choose to
                            recognize them as lawful belligerents, and give them shelter from our
                            pursuit and punishment, the laws of nations afford an adequate and
                            proper remedy.</p>
                        <p>Happily, however, her Britannic Majesty’s government can avoid all these
                            difficulties. It invited us in 1856 to accede to the declaration of the
                            congress of Paris, of which body Great Britain was herself a member,
                            abolishing privateering everywhere in all cases and forever. You already
                            have our authority to propose to her our accession to that declaration.
                            If she refuse it, it can only be because she is willing to become the
                            patron of privateering when aimed at our devastation.</p>
                        <pb n="90" xml:id="pg_90" facs="0090"/>
                        <p>These positions are not elaborately defended now, because to vindicate
                            them would imply a possibility of our waiving them.</p>
                        <p>We are not insensible of the grave importance of this occasion. We see
                            how, upon the result of the debate in which we are engaged, a war may
                            ensue between the United States and one, two, or even more European
                            nations. War in any case is as exceptional from the habits as it is
                            revolting from the sentiments of the American people. But if it come it
                            will be fully seen that it results from the action of Great Britain, not
                            our own; that Great Britain will have decided to fraternize with our
                            domestic enemy either without waiting to hear from you our remonstrances
                            and our warnings, or after having heard them. War in defence of national
                            life is not immoral, and war in defence of independence is an inevitable
                            part of the discipline of nations.</p>
                        <p>The dispute will be between the European and the American branches of the
                            British race. All who belong to that race will especially deprecate it,
                            as they ought. It may well be believed that men of every race and
                            kindred will deplore it. A war not unlike it between the same parties
                            occurred at the close of the last century. Europe atoned by forty years
                            of suffering for the error that Great Britain committed in provoking
                            that contest. If that nation shall now repeat the same great error, the
                            social convulsions which will follow may not be so long, but they will
                            be more general. When they shall have ceased, it will, we think, be
                            seen, whatever may have been the fortunes of other nations, that it is
                            not the United States that will have come out of them with its precious
                            Constitution altered, or its honestly obtained dominions in any degree
                            abridged. Great Britain has but to wait a few months, and all her
                            present inconveniences will cease with all our own troubles. If she take
                            a different course she will calculate for herself the ultimate, as well
                            as the immediate consequences, and will consider what position she will
                            hold when she shall have forever lost the sympathies and affections of
                            the only nation on whose sympathies and affections she has a natural
                            claim. In making that calculation she will do well to remember that in
                            the controversy she proposes to open we shall be actuated by neither
                            pride, nor passion, nor cupidity, nor ambition; but we shall stand
                            simply oh the principle of self preservation, and that our cause will
                            involve the independence of nations and the rights of human nature.</p>
                        <p>I am, sir, respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: At the close of my last despatch I stated
                            my purpose to ask an early interview with Lord John Russell. A note to
                            that effect was immediately sent to the foreign office. An answer was
                            received on Saturday morning, saying that his lordship would be happy to
                            see me, if I would take the trouble to go out to Pembroke Lodge, at
                            Richmond, where he is retired for the present, on Monday at twelve or
                            one o’clock, or, if I preferred it, he would see me at one o’clock on
                            that same day, (May 18.) Although it was approaching eleven o’clock when
                            I got the answer, and the distance exceeds <pb n="91" xml:id="pg_91"
                                facs="0091"/> nine miles from the city, I replied by accepting the
                            earlier appointment, and was probably myself at the Lodge before he
                            received my note.</p>
                        <p>Be this as it may, I found his lordship ready to receive me, so that I
                            proceeded at once to business. After expressing the general feeling
                            which I believed prevailing in the United States of good will towards
                            Great Britain, and the confident expectations I had entertained, down to
                            the period of my arrival, that these sentiments were fully reciprocated
                            to my government on the part of the government here, I signified my
                            sense of disappointment in not finding this quite so unequivocally
                            manifested as I had hoped. There were now fewer topics of direct
                            difference between the two countries than had probably existed at any
                            preceding time, and even these had been withdrawn from discussion at
                            this place to be treated on the other side of the water. I therefore
                            came out here with little to do beyond the duty of preserving the
                            relations actually existing from the risk of being unfavorably affected
                            by the unfortunate domestic disturbances prevailing in my own country.
                            It was not without pain that I was compelled to admit that from the day
                            of my arrival I had felt in the proceedings of both houses of
                            Parliament, in the language of her Majesty’s ministers, and in the tone
                            of opinion prevailing in private circles, more of uncertainty about this
                            than I had before thought possible. This sentiment alone would have
                            impelled me to solicit an early interview; but I was now come under a
                            much stronger motive. I had just received a despatch from my government,
                            based upon a letter from Mr. Dallas, of much earlier date than any of
                            the matters to which I had alluded. In that letter he had reported a
                            conversation with his lordship, the close of which had been deemed so
                            unsatisfactory that I had been directed at once to seek for a further
                            elucidation of his meaning. It was the desire of my government to learn
                            whether it was the intention of her Majesty’s ministers to adopt a
                            policy which would have the effect to widen, if not to make irreparable,
                            a breach which we believed yet to be entirely manageable by
                            ourselves.</p>
                        <p>At this point his lordship replied by saying that there was no such
                            intention. The clearest evidence of that was to be found in the
                            assurance given by him to Mr. Dallas in the earlier part of the
                            conversation referred to. With regard to the other portion, against
                            which I understood him to intimate he had already heard from Lord Lyons
                            that the President had taken exception, he could only say that he hardly
                            saw his way to bind the government to any specific course, when
                            circumstances beyond their agency rendered it difficult to tell what
                            might happen. Should the insurgent States ultimately succeed in
                            establishing themselves in an independent position, of the probability
                            of which he desired to express no opinion, he presumed, from the general
                            course of the United States heretofore, that they did not mean to
                            require of other countries to pledge themselves to go further than they
                            had been in the habit of going themselves. He therefore, by what he had
                            said to Mr. Dallas, simply meant to say that they were not disposed in
                            any way to interfere.</p>
                        <p>To this I replied by begging leave to remark that, so far as my
                            government was concerned, any desire to interfere had never been imputed
                            to Great Britain; but in her peculiar position it was deserving of grave
                            consideration whether great caution was not to be used in adopting any
                            course that might, even in the most indirect way, have an effect to
                            encourage the hopes of the disaffected in America. It had now come to
                            this, that without support from here, the people of the United States
                            considered the termination of this difficulty as almost entirely a
                            question of time. Any course adopted here that would materially change
                            that calculation would inevitably raise the most unpleasant feelings
                            among them. For independently of the absolute influence of Great
                            Britain, admitted to be great, the effect of any supposed <pb n="92"
                                xml:id="pg_92" facs="0092"/> inclination on her part could not fail
                            to be extensive among the other nations of Europe. It was my belief that
                            the insurgent States could scarcely hope for sympathy on this side of
                            the Atlantic, if deprived of any prospect of it here. Hence anything
                            that looked like a manifestation of it would be regarded among us as
                            inevitably tending to develope an ultimate separation in America; and,
                            whether intended or not, the impression made would scarcely be effaced
                            by time. It was in this view that I must be permitted to express the
                            great regret I had felt on learning the decision to issue the Queen’s
                            proclamation, which at once raised the insurgents to the level of a
                            belligerent State, and still more the language used in regard to it by
                            her Majesty’s ministers in both houses of Parliament before and since.
                            Whatever might be the design, there could be no shadow of doubt that the
                            effect of these events had been to encourage the friends of the
                            disaffected here. The tone of the press and of private opinion indicated
                            it strongly. I then alluded more especially to the brief report of the
                            lord chancellor’s speech on Thursday last, in which he had characterized
                            the rebellious portion of my country as a belligerent State, and the war
                            that was going on as <hi rend="italic">justum bellum</hi>.</p>
                        <p>To this his lordship replied that he thought more stress was laid upon
                            these events than they deserved. The fact was that a necessity seemed to
                            exist to define the course of the government in regard to the
                            participation of the subjects of Great Britain in the impending
                            conflict. To that end the legal questions involved had been referred to
                            those officers most conversant with them, and their advice had been
                            taken in shaping the result. Their conclusion had been that, as a
                            question merely of <hi rend="italic">fact</hi>, a war existed. A
                            considerable number of the States, at least seven, occupying a wide
                            extent of country, were in open resistance, whilst one or more of the
                            others were associating themselves in the same struggle, and as yet
                            there were no indications of any other result than a contest of arms
                            more or less severe. In many preceding cases, much less formidable
                            demonstrations had been recognized. Under such circumstances it seemed
                            scarcely possible to avoid speaking of this in the technical sense as
                                <hi rend="italic">justum bellum</hi>, that is, a war of two sides,
                            without in any way implying an opinion of its justice, as well as to
                            withhold an endeavor, so far as possible, to bring the management of it
                            within the rules of modern civilized warfare. This was all that was
                            contemplated by the Queen’s proclamation. It was designed to show the
                            purport of existing laws, and to explain to British subjects their
                            liabilities in case they should engage in the war. And however strongly
                            the people of the United States might feel against their enemies, it was
                            hardly to be supposed that in practice they would now vary from their
                            uniformly humane policy heretofore in endeavoring to assuage and
                            mitigate the horrors of war.</p>
                        <p>To all which I answered that under other circumstances I should be very
                            ready to give my cheerful assent to this view of his lordship’s. But I
                            must be permitted frankly to remark that the action taken seemed, at
                            least to my mind, a little more rapid than was absolutely called for by
                            the occasion. It might be recollected that the new administration had
                            scarcely had sixty days to develop its policy; that the extent to which
                            all departments of the government had been demoralized in the preceding
                            administration was surely understood here, at least in part; that the
                            very organization upon which any future action was to be predicated was
                            to be renovated and purified before a hope could be entertained of
                            energetic and effective labor. The consequence had been that it was but
                            just emerging from its difficulties, and beginning to develop the power
                            of the country to cope with this rebellion, when the British government
                            took the initiative, and decided practically that it is a struggle of
                            two sides. And furthermore, it pronounced the insurgents to be a
                            belligerent State before they had ever shown their capacity <pb n="93"
                                xml:id="pg_93" facs="0093"/> to maintain any kind of warfare
                            whatever, except within one of their own harbors, and under every
                            possible advantage. It considered them a marine power before they had
                            ever exhibited a single privateer on the ocean. I said that I was not
                            aware that a single armed vessel had yet been issued from any port under
                            the control of these people. Surely this was not the case in the
                            instance which had been relied upon in his speech by his lordship as
                            authority for the present action. There the Greeks, however small as a
                            people, had long been actively and effectually waging war, before the
                            interposition of Great Britain, and, to use the language of the
                            government, as quoted by himself, had “covered the sea with cruisers.”
                            It did seem to me therefore as if a little more time might have been
                            taken to form a more complete estimate of the relative force of the
                            contending parties, and of the probabilities of any long drawn issue.
                            And I did not doubt that the view taken by me would be that
                            substantially taken both by the government and the people of the United
                            States. They would inevitably infer the existence of an intention more
                            or less marked to extend the struggle. For this reason it was that I
                            made my present application to know whether such a design was or was not
                            entertained. For in the alternative of an affirmative answer it was as
                            well for us to know it, as I was bound to acknowledge in all frankness
                            that in that contingency I had nothing further left to do in Great
                            Britain. I said this with regret, as my own feelings had been and were
                            of the most friendly nature.</p>
                        <p>His lordship replied by an assurance that he participated in those
                            feelings; neither did he see the action that had been thus far taken at
                            all in the light in which I saw it. He believed that the United States,
                            in their own previous history, had furnished examples of action taken
                            quite as early as that now complained of. He instanced two cases. The
                            first I do not now remember, for it seemed to me not important at the
                            time; the other was the insurrection in Hungary under Kossuth, at which
                            period, he believed, they had gone so far as actually to send an agent
                            to that country with a view to recognition, and that to the great
                            dissatisfaction and against the remonstrances of Austria.</p>
                        <p>I replied only to the second case, by remarking that the incidents
                            attending that affair were not fresh in my mind, neither was I sure that
                            I ever knew the whole action of the government: but it was my impression
                            that the object of the mission was only confined to the acquisition of
                            the facts necessary to form an opinion, and that, after they were
                            obtained, no public step of any kind had been taken. Neither could I
                            myself recollect an instance in which ample time had not been given by
                            the United States for the development of events sufficiently decisive to
                            justify any action that might have followed; for I begged it to be
                            understood that the government did not mean at all to deny that there
                            were cases in which recognition of a revolutionary government might be
                            both expedient and proper. The rule was clear, that whenever it became
                            apparent that any organized form of society had advanced so far as to
                            prove its power to defend and protect itself against the assaults of
                            enemies, and at the same time to manifest a capacity to maintain binding
                            relations with foreign nations, then a measure of recognition could not
                            be justly objected to on any side. The case was very different when such
                            an interference should take place, prior to the establishment of the
                            proof required, as to bring about a result which would not probably have
                            happened but for that external agency.</p>
                        <p>And here I stop for a moment to make two remarks upon this part of the
                            conversation. The first of these is, that I have an impression that the
                            agent to go to Hungary, alluded to by his lordship, was Mr. Mann, the
                            same gentleman who is now figuring in the commission of the confederates
                            at this <pb n="94" xml:id="pg_94" facs="0094"/> place. If in this I am
                            right, we can be at no loss for his lordship’s sources of information.
                            The other remark is, that the Hungarian precedent was unquestionably one
                            in which a very strong sympathy with the insurgent party actually
                            existed in the United States. Are we therefore to infer a similar
                            impulse to actuate the precipitate measure now taken here?</p>
                        <p>I did not say this to his lordship, though I might have done so; but I
                            proceeded to observe that I had come to England prepared to present the
                            views of my government on the general question, and that I should have
                            done so in full but for the interposition of this more immediate
                            despatch. At the present moment I should touch only upon one point in
                            connexion with the acknowledgment of the insurgents even as a
                            belligerent State. It seemed necessary to call the attention of his
                            lordship to the fact which must be obvious to him, that as yet they had
                            not laid any foundation for government solid enough to deserve a
                            moment’s confidence. They had undertaken to withdraw certain States from
                            the government by an arbitrary act which they called secession, not
                            known to the Constitution, the validity of which had at no time been
                            acknowledged by the people of the United States, and which was now
                            emphatically denied; but not content with this, they had gone on to
                            substitute another system among themselves, avowedly based upon the
                            recognition of this right of States to withdraw or secede at pleasure.
                            With such a treaty, I would ask, where could be vested the obligation of
                            treaties with foreign powers, of the payment of any debts contracted,
                            or, indeed, of any act performed in good faith by the common authority
                            for the time being established. For my own part, I fully believed that
                            such a system could not deserve to be denominated, in any sense, a
                            government; and therefore I could not but think any act performed here,
                            having a tendency to invest it in the eye of the world with the notion
                            of form and substance, could be attended only with the most complete
                            disappointment to all the parties connected with it.</p>
                        <p>His lordship here interposed by saying that there was not, in his
                            opinion, any occasion at present for going into this class of arguments,
                            as the government did not contemplate taking any step that way. Should
                            any such time arrive in the future, he should be very ready to listen to
                            every argument that might be presented against it on the part of the
                            United States. At this moment he thought we had better confine ourselves
                            to the matter immediately in hand.</p>
                        <p>I then remarked that there was another subject upon which I had received
                            a despatch, though I should not, after so long a conference, venture to
                            do more than open the matter to-day. This was a proposal to negotiate in
                            regard to the rights of neutrals in time of war. The necessary powers
                            had been transmitted to me, together with a form of a convention, which
                            I would do myself the honor to submit to his consideration if there was
                            any disposition to pursue the matter further. His lordship then briefly
                            reviewed the past action of the two countries since the meeting of the
                            congress at Paris, and expressed the willingness of Great Britain to
                            negotiate; but he seemed to desire to leave the subject in the hands of
                            Lord Lyons, to whom he intimated that he had already transmitted
                            authority to assent to any modification of the only point in issue which
                            the government of the United States might prefer. On that matter he
                            believed there would be no difficulty whatever. Under these
                            circumstances, I shall not press the subject further at this place until
                            I receive new directions to that effect from the department.</p>
                        <p>His lordship then observed that there were two points upon which he
                            should be glad himself to be enlightened, although he did not know
                            whether I was prepared to furnish the information. They both related to
                            the President’s proclamation of a blockade. The first question was upon
                            the nature <pb n="95" xml:id="pg_95" facs="0095"/> of the blockade. The
                            coast was very extensive, stretching along the Atlantic and the Gulf of
                            Mexico a great way. Was it the design of the United States to institute
                            an effective blockade in its whole extent, or to make only a declaration
                            to that effect as to the whole, and to confine the actual blockade to
                            particular points? Considering the uniform doctrine of the government
                            refusing to recognize the validity of mere paper blockades, he could
                            hardly suppose they designed the latter.</p>
                        <p>To this I replied that I knew nothing directly of the President’s
                            intentions on this subject; but that inasmuch as the government had
                            always protested against mere paper blockades, I could not suppose that
                            it was now disposed to change its doctrine. On the contrary, I had every
                            reason for affirming that it was the intention to make an effective
                            blockade; and this was more practicable than at first sight might appear
                            from the fact that there were few harbors along the coast, however great
                            its extent, and these were not very easy of access. I thought,
                            therefore, that even though the blockade might not be perfect, it would
                            be sufficiently so to come within the legitimate construction of the
                            term.</p>
                        <p>His lordship then alluded to the other point, which was, that the
                            proclamation assigned no precise date for the commencement of the
                            blockade, which he believed was necessary; but he presumed that that
                            defect might be remedied at any time. To which I added that I did not
                            doubt any such omission of form would be supplied as soon as it was
                            pointed out.</p>
                        <p>His lordship then made some remarks upon the adoption of the tariff; to
                            which I replied that, in my belief, that law was mainly passed as a
                            revenue measure, with incidental protection; that it was not in any way
                            aimed in a hostile spirit to foreign nations; and that the people of the
                            United States would always buy from Great Britain as much as they could
                            pay for, and generally a good deal more. This last remark raised a
                            smile; and thus ended his lordship’s series of inquiries.</p>
                        <p>Having thus disposed of these secondary questions, I returned once more
                            to the charge, and asked him what answer I should return to the inquiry
                            which I had been directed to make. In order to avoid any ambiguity, I
                            took out of my pocket your despatch No. 4, and read to him the paragraph
                            recapitulating the substance of Mr. Dallas’s report of his interview,
                            and the very last paragraph. I said that it was important to me that I
                            should not make any mistake in reporting this part of the conversation;
                            therefore I should beg him to furnish me with the precise language. He
                            said that he did not himself know what he was to say. If it was expected
                            of him to give any pledge of an absolute nature that his government
                            would not at any future time, no matter what the circumstances might be,
                            recognize an existing State in America, it was more than he could
                            promise. If I wished an exact reply, my better way would be to address
                            him the inquiry in writing. I said that I was well aware of that, but I
                            had hoped that I might be saved the necessity of doing so. On
                            reflection, he proposed to avoid that by offering to transmit to Lord
                            Lyons directions to give such a reply to the President as, in his own
                            opinion, might be satisfactory. To this arrangement I gave my assent,
                            though not without some doubt whether I was doing right. In truth, if I
                            were persuaded that her Majesty’s government were really animated by a
                            desire to favor the rebellion, I should demand a categorical answer; but
                            thus far I see rather division of opinion, consequent upon the pressure
                            of the commercial classes. Hence I preferred to give the short time
                            demanded, as well as to place in the hands of the President himself the
                            power to decide upon the sufficiency of the reply.</p>

                            conference, which has been reported as fully and as accurately as my
                            memory would permit, was conducted in the most friendly spirit.</p>

                        <p>I have likewise to acknowledge the reception of a printed circular
                            addressed to my predecessor, Mr. Dallas, and dated the 27th of April,
                            1861, transmitting the proclamation of the President declaring the
                            blockade of the ports of Virginia and North Carolina. In this connexion
                            it may be as well to call your attention to the manner in which these
                            measures are viewed here, so far as it may be gathered from what is
                            casually dropped by members of Parliament as well as what is published
                            in the newspapers. A leading article in the Times newspaper of this
                            morning is especially deserving of attention. It would seem from this
                            that a scheme to overturn the old and recognized British law of
                            blockade, through the means of a joint declaration of the European
                            powers, somewhat after the fashion of the armed neutrality of the last
                            century, is among the things now floating in the minds of people here.
                            Great Britain, so long known and feared as the tyrant of the ocean, is
                            now to transform herself into a champion of neutral rights and the
                            freedom of navigation, even into the ports of all the world, with or
                            without regard to the interests of the nations to whom they may
                            belong.</p>
                        <p rend="center">* * * * * * </p>
                        <p>I beg to call your attention to the language used by Lord John Russell
                            and by Mr. Gladstone in the debate in the House of Commons last evening,
                            in relation to a passing remark of Sir John Ramsden upon American
                            affairs on the preceding Monday. They indicate what I believe to be
                            true, that the feeling toward the United States is improving in the
                            higher circles here. It was never otherwise than favorable among the
                            people at large. I was myself present and heard Sir John Ramsden on
                            Monday night. His remark was partially cheered by the opposition, who
                            were ready to receive anything favorably from a new convert; but I have
                            reason to believe that it met with decided condemnation from a large
                            majority of the members. The proof of this was established last night in
                            the manner in which the castigation of Mr. Gladstone, which I also
                            witnessed, was listened to and approved. Sir John seems to have gained
                            no laurels in this conflict. The ministry sustained themselves in the
                            division last night, which is, I presume, the decisive test for the
                            year. I believe this may be regarded as a favorable result to the <pb
                                n="97" xml:id="pg_97" facs="0097"/> United States. I shall reserve
                            some general observations on the subject for a separate despatch in the
                            early part of next week.</p>

                        <p>Your speech at Liverpool was equally prudent and happy. Your promptness
                            in passing through the town to the seat of government, although to be
                            regretted in some respects, is, in view of the circumstances,
                            approved.</p>
                        <p>Every instruction you have received from this department is full of
                            evidence of the fact that the principal danger in the present
                            insurrection which the President has apprehended was that of foreign
                            intervention, aid, or sympathy; and especially of such intervention,
                            aid, or sympathy on the part of the government of Great Britain.</p>
                        <p>The justice of this apprehension has been vindicated by the following
                            facts, namely: <list>

                                <item>A guarded reserve on the part of the British secretary of
                                    state, when Mr. Dallas presented to him our protest against the
                                    recognition of the insurgents, which seemed to imply that, in
                                    some conditions, not explained to us, such a recognition might
                                    be made.</item>

                                <item>The issue of the Queen’s proclamation, remarkable, first, for
                                    the circumstances under which it was made, namely, on the very
                                    day of your arrival in London, which had been anticipated so far
                                    as to provide for your reception by the British secretary, but
                                    without affording you the interview promised before any decisive
                                    action should be adopted; secondly, the tenor of the
                                    proclamation itself, which seems to recognize, in a vague
                                    manner, indeed, but does seem to recognize, the insurgents as a

                            </list></p>
                        <p>That proclamation, unmodified and unexplained, would leave us no
                            alternative but to regard the government of Great Britain as questioning
                            our free exercise of all the rights of self-defence guaranteed to us by
                            our Constitution and the laws of nature and of nations to suppress the
                            insurrection.</p>
                        <p>I should have proceeded at once to direct you to communicate to the
                            British government the definitive views of the President on the grave
                            subject, if there were not especial reasons for some little delay.</p>
                        <p>These reasons are, first, Mr. Thouvenel has informed our representative
                            at Paris that the two governments of Great Britain and France were
                            preparing, and would, without delay, address communications to this
                            government concerning the attitude to be assumed by them in regard to
                            the insurrection. Their communications are hourly expected.</p>
                        <p>Second. You have already asked, and, it is presumed, will have obtained,
                            an interview with the British secretary, and will have been able to
                            present <pb n="98" xml:id="pg_98" facs="0098"/> the general views of
                            this government, and to learn definitely the purposes of Great Britain
                            in the matter, after it shall have learned how unsatisfactory the action
                            of the British government hitherto has been to the government of the
                            United States.</p>
                        <p>The President is solicitous to show his high appreciation of every
                            demonstration of consideration for the United States which the British
                            government feels itself at liberty to make. He instructs me, therefore,
                            to say that the prompt and cordial manner in which you were received,
                            under peculiar circumstances arising out of domestic afflictions which
                            had befallen her Majesty and the secretary of state for foreign affairs,
                            is very gratifying to this government.</p>
                        <p>A year ago the differences which had partially estranged the British and
                            the American people from each other seemed to have been removed forever.
                            It is painful to reflect that that ancient alienation has risen up again
                            under circumstances which portend great social evils, if not disaster,
                            to both countries.</p>
                        <p>Referring you to previous instructions, and reserving further directions
                            until we shall have your own report of the attitude of the British
                            government as defined by itself for our consideration,</p>
                        <p>I am, sir, respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your several despatches, No. 7, of the 11th of May, with
                            copies of the correspondence relating to the slave trade and to San
                            Domingo; No. 8, of the 20th, enclosing the commission of Neil McLachlan,
                            esq., as consul at Leith; and No. 9, of the 21st, enclosing the
                            commission of Edward Leavenworth, esq., as consul at Sydney, New South
                            Wales. These commissions have been duly transmitted to her Majesty’s
                            secretary for foreign affairs, with the customary request for
                            recognition. The earlier papers have been carefully read, and will be
                            made the subject of consideration at the next conference, which I
                            purpose to ask of his lordship at an early day.</p>
                        <p>I think I can report with confidence a considerable amelioration of
                            sentiment here towards the government of the United States. This may be
                            partly ascribed to the impression made by the news received of vigorous
                            and effective measures in America, and partly to a sense that the
                            preceding action of her Majesty’s ministers has been construed to mean
                            more than they intended by it. It cannot be denied that it had opened a
                            most grave question touching the use that might be made of all the ports
                            of Great Britain as a shelter for captures by privateers purporting to
                            be authorized by the rebellious States. After a careful examination of
                            the subject, I had come to the conclusion that, without some further
                            positive action, the preceding practice in this country would authorize
                            the retention of such captures until condemned as prizes in some
                            admiralty court set up by the insurgents at home and the sale of them
                            afterwards. The effect of this, in giving them encouragement, can
                            scarcely be estimated. It would at once enlist in their behalf most of
                            the daring and desperate adventurers of every nation, whose sole object
                            is plunder, and would initiate a struggle between <pb n="99"
                                xml:id="pg_99" facs="0099"/> a community of planters, who have
                            nothing to lose on the ocean, and a commercial nation which whitens
                            every sea with the sails of a peaceful navigation. That so serious a
                            consequence as this was ever intended to flow from the precipitate act
                            of the government here I did not believe. Hence it was with great
                            satisfaction that I learned, on Monday, that the question would be
                            proposed on that day by Mr. Forster in the House of Commons, which you
                            will have seen before this in the record of the proceedings of that
                            body, and that it would be fully answered by Lord John Russell on behalf
                            of her Majesty’s ministers. This answer, as since made, may be regarded
                            as satisfactory, so far as it closes the door to one bad effect of the
                            proclamation; but it does not remove the main difficulty of putting the
                            legitimate and the spurious authority in the same category. Although in
                            practice the operation is favorable to the former, in theory the
                            admission of equality is equally vicious. The only consolation is to be
                            found in the evident desire betrayed by the government here to avoid in
                            any way a collision with the United States or any direct encouragement
                            of the insurgents.</p>
                        <p>This is the day assigned for the consideration of the motion of Mr.
                            Gregory, the member for Galway. I understand that he means to enter
                            largely into the question of recognition of the confederates, and that
                            he will probably be answered as fully. It is stated to me that the
                            ministry are willing to have the discussion go on. For obvious reasons I
                            do not think it advisable to attend the debate myself; but I shall take
                            measures to obtain the best information of the actual state of feeling
                            in the House from personal observation, and to transmit my own
                            conclusions in the next despatch. Unfortunately it will be necessary to
                            close the present one before evening, in order to be in time for the
                            steamer.</p>

                                the receipt of your note of the 5th instant, with the accompanying
                                papers, relative to a claim in the case of the cargo of the bark
                                Winifred, a part of which is represented to belong to British
                                subjects.</p>

                            <p>In reply, I regret that at this juncture I do not feel at liberty to
                                interfere in the case, as it is understood that the usual
                                proceedings in the prize court at New York have been set on foot
                                against the vessel and her cargo.</p>
                            <p>If, however, that court shall be satisfied of the ownership by
                                British subjects of the part of the cargo claimed, it cannot be
                                doubted that restitution will be decreed, as this government
                                recognizes the right of the property of a friendly nation in the
                                vessels of an insurgent to be exempted from condemnation.</p>
                            <p>The papers which accompanied your note are herewith returned.</p>
                            <p>I have the honor to be, with the highest consideration, your

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the pleasure of acknowledging the
                            receipt of your despatch of May 21, (No. 2,) which contains a report of
                            the conversation which you had held with Lord John Russell on the 18th
                            day of that month.</p>
                        <p>This government insists, as all the world might have known that it must
                            and would, under all circumstances, insist, on the integrity of the
                            Union, as the chief element of national life. Since, after trials of
                            every form of forbearance and conciliation, it has been rendered certain
                            and apparent that this paramount and vital object can be saved only by
                            our acceptance of civil war as an indispensable condition, that
                            condition, with all its hazards and deplorable evils, has not been
                            declined. The acceptance, however, is attended with a strong desire and
                            fixed purpose that the war shall be as short and accompanied by as
                            little suffering as possible. Foreign intervention, aid, or sympathy in
                            favor of the insurgents, especially on the part of Great Britain,
                            manifestly could only protract and aggravate the war. Accordingly, Mr.
                            Dallas, under instructions from the President, in an interview conceded
                            to him by the British secretary of state for foreign affairs, presented
                            our protest against any such intervention.</p>
                        <p>Lord John Russell answered with earnestness that there was not in the
                            British government the least desire to grasp at any advantages which
                            might be supposed to arise from the unpleasant domestic differences in
                            the United States, but, on the contrary, that they would be highly
                            gratified if those differences were adjusted, and the Union restored to
                            its former unbroken position.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Dallas then, as he reported to us, endeavored to impress upon his
                            lordship how important it must be that Great Britain and France should
                            abstain, at least for a considerable time, from doing what, by
                            encouraging groundless hopes, (of the insurgents,) would widen a breach
                            still thought capable of being closed; but his lordship seemed to think
                            that the matter was not ripe for decision, one way or another, and
                            remarked that what he had already said was all that at present it was in
                            his power to say.</p>
                        <p>Upon this report you were instructed to inform her Britannic Majesty’s
                            government that the President regarded the reply made by his lordship to
                            Mr. Dallas’s suggestion as possibly indicating a policy which this
                            government would be obliged to deem injurious to its rights, and
                            derogating from its <pb n="101" xml:id="pg_101" facs="0101"/> dignity.
                            This government thought the reply of the secretary unjustifiably abrupt
                            and reserved. That abruptness and reserve unexplained, left us under a
                            seeming necessity of inferring that the British government might be
                            contemplating a policy of encouragement to the insurgents which would
                            widen the breach here which we believed it possible to heal if such
                            encouragement should not be extended. A vital interest obliged the
                            United States to seek explanation, or to act on the inference it thus
                            felt itself obliged to adopt.</p>
                        <p>Your despatch of the 21st of May, (No. 2,) which has just been received,
                            shows how you have acquitted yourself of the duty imposed upon you.
                            After stating our complaint to his lordship, you very properly asked an
                            elucidation of his meaning in the reply to which exception had been
                            taken by us, and very rightly, as we think, asked whether it was the
                            intention of her Majesty’s ministers to adopt a policy which would have
                            the effect to widen, if not to make irreparable, a breach which we
                            believe yet to be entirely manageable by ourselves. His lordship
                            disclaimed any such intention. A friendly argument, however, then arose
                            between the secretary and yourself concerning what should be the form of
                            the answer to us which his lordship could properly give, and which
                            would, at the same time, be satisfactory to this government. The
                            question was finally solved in the most generous manner by the
                            proposition of his lordship that he would instruct Lord Lyons to give
                            such a reply to the President as might, in his own opinion, be
                            satisfactory, which proposition you accepted.</p>
                        <p>I hasten to say, by direction of the President, that your course in this
                            proceeding is fully approved. This government has no disposition to lift
                            questions of even national pride or sensibility up to the level of
                            diplomatic controversy, because it earnestly and ardently desires to
                            maintain peace, harmony, and cordial friendship with Great Britain. Lord
                            John Russell’s proposition, by authorizing the President to put the most
                            favorable construction possible upon the response which was deemed
                            exceptionable, removes the whole difficulty without waiting for the
                            intervention of Lord Lyons. You will announce this conclusion to Lord
                            John Russell, and inform him that the settlement of the affair in so
                            friendly a spirit affords this government sincere satisfaction.</p>
                        <p>Your conversation with the British secretary incidentally brought into
                            debate the Queen’s late proclamation, (which seems to us designed to
                            raise the insurgents to the level of a belligerent state;) the language
                            employed by her Majesty’s ministers in both houses of Parliament, the
                            tone of the public press, and of private opinion, and especially a
                            speech of the lord chancellor, in which he had characterized the
                            insurgents as a belligerent State, and the civil war which they are
                            waging against the United States as <hi rend="italic">justum
                            bellum</hi>.</p>
                        <p>The opinions which you expressed on these matters, and their obvious
                            tendency to encourage the insurrection and to protract and aggravate the
                            civil war, are just, and meet our approbation. At the same time, it is
                            the purpose of this government, if possible, consistently with the
                            national welfare and honor, to have no serious controversy with Great
                            Britain at all; and if this shall ultimately prove impossible, then to
                            have both the defensive position and the clear right on our side. With
                            this view, this government, as you were made aware by my despatch No.
                            10, has determined to pass over without official complaint the
                            publications of the British press, manifestations of adverse individual
                            opinion in social life, and the speeches of British statesmen, and even
                            those of her Majesty’s ministers in Parliament, so long as they are not
                            authoritatively adopted by her Majesty’s government. We honor and
                            respect the freedom of debate, and the freedom of <pb n="102"
                                xml:id="pg_102" facs="0102"/> the press. We indulge no apprehensions
                            of danger to our rights and interests from any discussion to which they
                            may be subjected, in either form, in any place. Sure as we are that the
                            transaction now going on in our country involves the progress of
                            civilization and humanity, and equally sure that our attitude in it is
                            right, and no less sure that our press and our statesmen are equal in
                            ability and influence to any in Europe, we shall have no cause to grieve
                            if Great Britain shall leave to us the defence of the independence of
                            nations and the rights of human nature.</p>
                        <p>My despatch No. 14 presented four distinct grounds on which this
                            government apprehended a policy on the part of her Majesty’s government
                            to intervene in favor of the insurgents, or to lend them aid and
                            sympathy. The first ground was the reserve practiced by the British
                            secretary for foreign affairs in his conversation with Mr. Dallas,
                            referred to in the earlier part of this despatch. I have already stated
                            that the explanations made and offered by Lord John Russell have
                            altogether removed this ground from debate.</p>
                        <p>The second was the contracting of an engagement by the government of
                            Great Britain with that of France, without consulting us, to the effect
                            that both governments would adopt one and the same course of proceeding
                            in regard to the subject of intervention in our domestic affairs. You
                            were informed in my despatch No. 10 that, as this proceeding did not
                            necessarily imply hostile feelings towards the United States, we should
                            not formally complain of it, but should rest content with a resolution
                            to hold intercourse only with each of those States severally, giving due
                            notice to both that the circumstance that a concert between the two
                            powers in any proposition each might offer to us would not modify in the
                            least degree the action of the United States upon it.</p>
                        <p>The third ground was Lord John Russell’s announcement to Mr. Dallas that
                            he was not unwilling to receive the so-called commissioners of the
                            insurgents unofficially. On this point you already have instructions, to
                            which nothing need now be added.</p>
                        <p>The fourth ground is the Queen’s proclamation, exceptionable first for
                            the circumstances under which it was issued, and secondly, for the
                            matter of that important state paper.</p>
                        <p>My despatch No. 14 apprised you of our reason for expecting a direct
                            communication on this subject from her Majesty’s government. I reserve
                            instructions on this fourth ground, as I did in that despatch, expecting
                            to discuss it fully when the promised direct communication shall bring
                            it authoritatively before this government in the form chosen by the
                            British government itself.</p>
                        <p>My silence on the subject of the defence of that proclamation made by
                            Lord John Russell in his conversation with you being grounded on that
                            motive for delay, it is hardly necessary to say that we are not to be
                            regarded as conceding any positions which his lordship assumed, and
                            which you so ably contested on the occasion referred to in your
                            despatch. Your argument on that point is approved by the President.</p>
                        <p>The British government having committed the subject of the proposed
                            modifications of international law on the subject of the right of
                            neutrals in maritime war to Lord Lyons before you were prepared by our
                            instructions to present the subject to that government, no objection is
                            now seen to the discussion of that matter here. No communication on any
                            subject herein discussed has yet been received from Lord Lyons.
                            Despatches which you must have received before this time will have
                            enabled you to give entire satisfaction to his lordship concerning the
                            blockade. We claim to have a right to close the ports which have been
                            seized by insurrectionists, for the purpose of suppressing the attempted
                            revolution, and no one could justly <pb n="103" xml:id="pg_103"
                                facs="0103"/> complain if we had done so decisively and
                            peremptorily. In resorting to the milder and very lenient form of the
                            blockade, we have been governed by a desire to avoid imposing hardships
                            unnecessarily onerous upon foreign as well as domestic commerce. The
                            President’s proclamation was a notice of the intention to blockade, and
                            it was provided that ample warning should be given to vessels
                            approaching and vessels seeking to leave the blockaded ports before
                            capture should be allowed. The blockade from the time it takes effect is
                            everywhere rendered actual and effective.</p>
                        <p>Your remarks on the subject of the late tariff law were judicious. The
                            subject of revenue policy in the altered condition of affairs is not
                            unlikely to receive the attention of Congress.</p>
                        <p>We are gratified by the information you have given us of the friendly
                            spirit which has thus far marked the deportment and conversation of the
                            British government in your official intercourse with it.</p>
                        <p>I am, sir, respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have to acknowledge the reception of
                            your despatches No. 10, dated the 21st of May, and No. 11, dated on the
                            24th, with a copy of a letter from Mr. O. Vandenburgh, and also a
                            printed circular from the department of the 20th of May, relating to
                            purchases made here of articles contraband of war.</p>
                        <p>The intelligence of the feeling expressed in America upon the reception
                            of the Queen’s proclamation was fully expected by me, so that it excited
                            no surprise, and much of the course of your argument in your despatch
                            will be found to have been already adopted in my conference with Lord
                            John Russell, an account of which is before this time in your hands.</p>
                        <p rend="center">* * * * * * * *</p>
                        <p>However this may be, my duty was plain. I applied for an interview with
                            Lord John Russell, and he appointed one for ten o’clock on Wednesday,
                            the 12th, at his own house. After some slight preliminary talk, I
                            observed to him that I had been instructed to press upon her Majesty’s
                            government the expediency of early action on the subject of
                            privateering; that in the <pb n="104" xml:id="pg_104" facs="0104"/>
                            present state of excitement in the United States consequent upon the
                            measures which it had felt it necessary to adopt, I did not know of
                            anything which would be so likely to allay it as an agreement on this
                            point. His lordship then said that he did not know whether I knew it,
                            but the fact was that Mr. Dayton had made a proposition to France for
                            negotiation on the basis of the articles as agreed upon in Paris. France
                            had communicated the fact through her minister, the Compte de Flahault;
                            and he intimated that there had been a cabinet conversation on the
                            subject, without arriving at a decision. I then referred to what had
                            passed at our former interview. I mentioned my proposal to negotiate,
                            and the inclination shown by his lordship to leave the subject with Lord
                            Lyons, with authority to arrange the only point in dispute as the
                            government at Washington might desire. There I had left the matter. His
                            lordship replied that he did not mean to be quite so understood. His
                            intention was to say, that having agreed upon the three articles, he
                            should be ready to consent to the total, omission of the fourth article,
                            if that would be agreeable at Washington. I said that I had not so
                            understood him, and from my present recollection, I am confident that my
                            report of his language was not incorrect.</p>
                        <p rend="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
                        <p>I next approached the most delicate portion of my task. I descanted upon
                            the irritation produced in America by the Queen’s proclamation, upon the
                            construction almost universally given to it, as designed to aid the
                            insurgents by raising them to the rank of a belligerent State, and upon
                            the very decided tone taken by the President in my despatches in case
                            any such design was really entertained. I added that from my own
                            observation of what had since occurred here, I had not been able to
                            convince myself of the existence of such a design. But it was not to be
                            disguised that the fact of the continued stay of the pseudo
                            commissioners in this city, and still more the knowledge that they had
                            been admitted to more or less interviews with his lordship, was
                            calculated to excite uneasiness. Indeed, it had already given great
                            dissatisfaction to my government. I added, as moderately as I could,
                            that in all frankness any further protraction of this relation could
                            scarcely fail to be viewed by us as hostile in spirit, and to require
                            some corresponding action accordingly.</p>
                        <p>His lordship then reviewed the course of Great Britain. He explained the
                            mode in which they had consulted with France, prior to any action at
                            all, as to the reception of the deputation from the so-called
                            Confederate States. It had been the custom both in France and here to
                            receive such persons unofficially for a long time back. Poles,
                            Hungarians, Italians, &amp;c., &amp;c., had been allowed interviews, to
                            hear what they had to say. But this did not imply recognition in their
                            case any more than in ours. He added that he had seen the gentlemen once
                            some time ago, and once more some time since; he had no expectation of
                            seeing them any more.</p>
                        <p rend="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
                        <p>I shall continue my relations here until I discover some action
                            apparently in conflict with it, or receive specific orders from the
                            department dictating an opposite course.</p>
                        <p>I ventured to repeat my regret that the proclamation had been so hastily
                            issued, and adverted to the fact that it seemed contrary to the
                            agreement said to have been proposed by Mr. Dallas and concurred in by
                            his lordship, to postpone all action until I should arrive, possessed
                            with all the views of the new administration. But still, though I felt
                            that much mischief had ensued in the creation of prejudices in the
                            United States, not now easy to be eradicated, I was not myself disposed
                            in any part of my conduct to aggravate the evil. My views had been much
                            modified by opportunities of <pb n="105" xml:id="pg_105" facs="0105"/>
                            more extended conversation with persons of weight in Great Britain, by
                            the improved tone of the press, by subsequent explanations in
                            Parliament, by the prohibition of all attempts to introduce prizes into
                            British ports, and, lastly, by the unequivocal expression of sentiment
                            in the case of Mr. Gregory when the time came for him to press his
                            motion of recognition. I trusted that nothing new might occur to change
                            the current again, for nothing was so unfortunate as the effect of a
                            recurrence of reciprocal irritations, however trifling, between
                            countries, in breaking up the good understanding which it was always
                            desirable to preserve.</p>
                        <p>His lordship agreed to this, but remarked that he could not but think the
                            complaint of the proclamation, though natural enough perhaps at this
                            moment, was really ill founded. He went over the ground once more which
                            he occupied in the former interview—the necessity of doing something to
                            relieve the officers of their ships from the responsibility of treating
                            these persons as pirates if they met them on the seas. For his part, he
                            could not believe the United States would persevere in the idea of
                            hanging them, for it was not in consonance with their well-known
                            character. But what would be their own situation if they should be found
                            practicing upon a harsher system than the Americans themselves.</p>
                        <p>Here was a very large territory—a number of States—and people counted by
                            millions, who were in a state of actual war. The fact was undeniable and
                            the embarrassment unavoidable. Under such circumstances the law officers
                            of the crown advised the policy which had been adopted. It was designed
                            only as a preventive to immediate evils. The United States should not
                            have thought hard of it. They meant to be entirely neutral.</p>
                        <p>I replied that we asked no more than that. We desired no assistance. Our
                            objection to this act was that it was practically not an act of
                            neutrality. It had depressed the spirits of the friends of the
                            government. It had raised the courage of the insurgents. We construed it
                            as adverse, because we could not see the necessity of such immediate
                            haste. These people were not a navigating people. They had not a ship on
                            the ocean. They had made no prizes, so far as I knew, excepting such as
                            they had caught by surprises. Even now, I could not learn that they had
                            fitted out anything more than a few old steamboats, utterly unable to
                            make any cruise on the ocean, and scarcely strong enough to bear a
                            cannon of any calibre. But it was useless to go over this any more. The
                            thing was now done. All that we could hope was that the later
                            explanations would counteract the worst effects that we had reason to
                            apprehend from it; and, at any rate, there was one compensation, the act
                            had released the government of the United States from responsibility for
                            any misdeeds of the rebels towards Great Britain. If any of their people
                            should capture or maltreat a British vessel on the ocean, the
                            reclamation must be made only upon those who had authorized the wrong.
                            The United States would not be liable.</p>
                        <p>I added that I could not close the interview without one word upon a
                            subject on which I had no instructions. I saw by the newspapers an
                            account of a considerable movement of troops to Canada. In our situation
                            this would naturally excite attention at home, and I was therefore
                            desirous to learn whether they were ordered with any reference to
                            possible difficulties with us. His lordship said that the country had
                            been denuded of troops for some time back, and it was regarded only as a
                            proper measure of precaution, in the present disordered condition of
                            things in the United States, to restore a part of them. He said he did
                            not know but what we might do something. He intimated a little feeling
                            of uneasiness at the mission of Mr. Ashmun, without any notice given to
                            them of his purposes; and he likewise said something about a threat
                            uttered by yourself to Lord Lyons to seize a British <pb n="106"
                                xml:id="pg_106" facs="0106"/> vessel on Lake Ontario without
                            ceremony. To this I replied, that inasmuch as I had understood Mr.
                            Ashmun’s mission had been made known to the governor of Canada, it did
                            not seem to me that it could be of much concealed significance; and that
                            as to the other matter, if there was any reality in the threat, it
                            surely was an odd way of proceeding to furnish at once the warning in
                            time to provide against its execution.</p>
                        <p rend="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
                        <p>I did not touch at all on the subject of the blockade, as referred to in
                            your despatch No. 10, for the reason that I do not now understand the
                            government as disposed in any way to question its validity or to
                            obstruct it. On the contrary, his lordship, incidentally referring to it
                            in this interview, said that instructions had been sent out to the naval
                            officers in command to respect it, and never themselves to seek to enter
                            any of the ports blockaded, unless from some urgent necessity to protect
                            British persons or property.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: On the 15th day of June instant, Lord
                            Lyons, the British minister, and Mr. Mercier, the French minister,
                            residing here, had an appointed interview with me. Each of those
                            representatives proposed to read to me an instruction which he had
                            received from his government, and to deliver me a copy if I should
                            desire it. I answered, that in the present state of the correspondence
                            between their respective governments and that of the United States, I
                            deemed it my duty to know the characters and effects of the
                            instructions, respectively, before I could consent that they should be
                            officially communicated to this department. The ministers therefore,
                            confidentially, and very frankly, submitted the papers to me for
                            preliminary inspection. After having examined them so far as to
                            understand their purport, I declined to hear them read, or to receive
                            official notice of them.</p>
                        <p>I proceed now to give you our reasons for this course, that you may, if
                            you find it necessary or expedient, communicate them to the government
                            of Great Britain.</p>
                        <p>When we received official information that an understanding was existing
                            between the British and French governments that they would take one and
                            the same course concerning the insurrection which has occurred in this
                            country, involving the question of recognizing the independence of a
                            revolutionary organization, we instructed you to inform the British
                            government that we had expected from both of those powers a different
                            course of proceeding. We added, however, that insomuch as the proposed
                            concert of action between them did not necessarily imply any
                            unfriendliness of purpose or of disposition, we should not complain of
                            it, but that we should insist in this case, as in all others, on dealing
                            with each of those powers alone, and that their agreement to act
                            together would not at all affect the course which we should pursue.
                            Adhering to this decision, we have not made the concert of the two
                            powers a ground of objection to the reading of the instruction with
                            which Lord Lyons was charged.</p>
                        <p>That paper purports to contain a decision at which the British government
                            has arrived, to the effect that this country is divided into two
                            belligerent <pb n="107" xml:id="pg_107" facs="0107"/> parties, of which
                            this government represents one, and that Great Britain assumes the
                            attitude of a neutral between them.</p>
                        <p>This government could not, consistently with a just regard for the
                            sovereignty of the United States, permit itself to debate these novel
                            and extraordinary positions with the government of her Britannic
                            Majesty; much less can we consent that that government shall announce to
                            us a decision derogating from that sovereignty, at which it has arrived
                            without previously conferring with us upon the question. The United
                            States are still solely and exclusively sovereign within the territories
                            they have lawfully acquired and long possessed, as they have always
                            been. They are at peace with all the world, as, with unimportant
                            exceptions, they have always been. They are living under the obligations
                            of the law of nations, and of treaties with Great Britain, just the same
                            now as heretofore; they are, of course, the friend of Great Britain, and
                            they insist that Great Britain shall remain their friend now just as she
                            has hitherto been. Great Britain, by virtue of these relations, is a
                            stranger to parties and sections in this country, whether they are loyal
                            to the United States or not, and Great Britain can neither rightfully
                            qualify the sovereignty of the United States, nor concede, nor recognize
                            any rights, or interests, or power of any party, State, or section, in
                            contravention to the unbroken sovereignty of the federal Union. What is
                            now seen in this country is the occurrence, by no means peculiar, but
                            frequent in all countries, more frequent even in Great Britain than
                            here, of an armed insurrection engaged in attempting to overthrow the
                            regularly constituted and established government. There is, of course,
                            the employment of force by the government to suppress the insurrection,
                            as every other government necessarily employs force in such cases. But
                            these incidents by no means constitute a state of war impairing the
                            sovereignty of the government, creating belligerent sections, and
                            entitling foreign States to intervene or to act as neutrals between
                            them, or in any other way to cast off their lawful obligations to the
                            nation thus for the moment disturbed. Any other principle than this
                            would be to resolve government everywhere into a thing of accident and
                            caprice, and ultimately all human society into a state of perpetual
                            war.</p>
                        <p>We do not go into any argument of fact or of law in support of the
                            positions we have thus assumed. They are simply the suggestions of the
                            instinct of self-defence, the primary law of human action, not more the
                            law of individual than of national life.</p>
                        <p>This government is sensible of the importance of the step it takes in
                            declining to receive the communication in question. It hopes and
                            believes, however, that it need not disturb the good relations which
                            have hitherto subsisted between the two countries which, more than any
                            other nations, have need to live together in harmony and friendship.</p>
                        <p>We believe that Great Britain has acted inadvertently, and under the
                            influence of apprehensions of danger to her commerce, which either are
                            exaggerated or call for fidelity on her part to her habitual relations
                            to the United States, instead of a hasty attempt to change those
                            relations.</p>
                        <p>Certainly this government has exerted itself to the utmost to prevent
                            Great Britain from falling into the error of supposing that the United
                            States could consent to any abatement of their sovereignty in the
                            present emergency. It is, we take leave to think, the common misfortune
                            of the two countries that Great Britain was not content to wait before
                            despatching the instruction in question, until you had been received by
                            her Majesty’s government, and had submitted the entirely just, friendly,
                            and liberal overtures with which you were charged.</p>
                        <p>Although the paper implies, without affirming, that the insurgents of
                            this <pb n="108" xml:id="pg_108" facs="0108"/> country possess some
                            belligerent rights, it does not name, specify, or indicate one such
                            right. It confines itself to stating what the British government require
                            or expect the United States to do. Virtually, it asks us to concede to
                            Great Britain the principles laid down in the declaration of the
                            congress held at Paris in 1856. It asks indeed a little less, certainly
                            nothing more or different from this. The British government ask this of
                            us to-day, the 15th of June, in ignorance of the fact that we had, so
                            early as the 25th of April, instructed you to tender, without
                            reservation, to Great Britain our accession, pure and simple, to that
                            declaration. We have all the while, since that instruction was sent
                            forth, been ready, as we now are ready, to accede to the declaration,
                            where and whenever Great Britain may be ready and willing to receive it.
                            The argument contained in the instruction seems, therefore, to have been
                            as unnecessary and irrelevant as it is unacceptable. Lord Lyons thinks
                            that his instructions do not authorize him to enter into convention with
                            us here. You will inform the government of Great Britain of the fact,
                            and, if they prefer, you will enter into the convention at London.</p>
                        <p>Of course it is understood that the concessions herein made do not affect
                            or impair the right of the United States to suppress the insurrection as
                            well by maritime as by land operations, and for this purpose to exclude
                            all commerce from such of the ports as may have fallen into the hands of
                            the insurgents, either by closing the ports directly or by the more
                            lenient means of a blockade, which we have already adopted.</p>
                        <p>It is thus seen that, in the present case, there is only an embarrassment
                            resulting from the similar designs of the two governments to reach one
                            common object by different courses without knowledge of each others
                            dispositions in that respect. There is nothing more. We propose, as a
                            nation at peace, to give to Great Britain as a friend what she as a
                            neutral demands of us, a nation at war. We rejoice that it happens so.
                            We are anxious to avoid all causes of misunderstanding with Great
                            Britain; to draw closer, in stead of breaking, the existing bonds of
                            amity and friendship. There is nothing good or great which both nations
                            may not expect to attain or effect if they may remain friends. It would
                            be a hazardous day for both the branches of the British race when they
                            should determine to try how much harm each could do the other.</p>
                        <p>We do not forget that, although thus happily avoiding misunderstanding on
                            the present occasion, Great Britain may in some way hereafter do us
                            wrong or injury by adhering to the speculative views of the rights and
                            duties of the two governments which she has proposed to express. But we
                            believe her to be sincere in the good wishes for our welfare, which she
                            has so constantly avowed, and we will not, therefore, suffer ourselves
                            to anticipate occasions for difference which, now that both nations
                            fully understand each other, may be averted or avoided.</p>
                        <p>One point remains. The British government while declining, out of regard
                            to our natural sensibility, to propose mediation for the settlement of
                            the differences which now unhappily divide the American people, have
                            nevertheless expressed, in a very proper manner, their willingness to
                            undertake the kindly duty of mediation, if we should desire it. The
                            President expects you to say on this point to the British government,
                            that we appreciate this generous and friendly demonstration; but that we
                            cannot solicit or accept mediation from any, even the most friendly
                            quarter. The conditions of society here, the character of our
                            government, the exigencies of the country, forbid that any dispute
                            arising among us should ever be referred to foreign arbitration. We are
                            a republican and American people. The Constitution of our govenment
                            furnishes all needful means for the correction or removal of any
                            possible political evil. Adhering strictly as we do to its directions,
                            we shall <pb n="109" xml:id="pg_109" facs="0109"/> surmount all our
                            present complications, and preserve the government complete, perfect,
                            and sound, for the benefit of future generations. But the integrity of
                            any nation is lost, and its fate becomes doubtful, whenever strange
                            hands, and instruments unknown to the Constitution, are employed to
                            perform the proper functions of the people, established by the organic
                            laws of the State.</p>
                        <p>Hoping to have no occasion hereafter to speak for the hearing of friendly
                            nations upon the topics which I have now discussed, I add a single
                            remark by way of satisfying the British government that it will do
                            wisely by leaving us to manage and settle this domestic controversy in
                            our own way.</p>
                        <p>The fountains of discontent in any society are many, and some lie much
                            deeper than others. Thus far this unhappy controversy has disturbed only
                            those which are nearest the surface. There are others which lie still
                            deeper that may yet remain, as we hope, long undisturbed. If they should
                            be reached, no one can tell how or when they could be closed. It was
                            foreign intervention that opened and that alone could open similar
                            fountains in the memorable French revolution.</p>
                        <p>I am, sir, respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

                        <p>I have not deemed it necessary to ask a special interview to communicate
                            to Lord John Russell the sense entertained by the President of the
                            manner of my reception here, as directed in yours of the 3d of June.
                            Presuming it to be altogether likely that another despatch, prepared
                            after the reception of my No. 2, is now near at hand, I have preferred
                            to wait and see if that may not give me other matter to submit at the
                            same time.</p>
                        <p>The intelligence received from the United States of the effect produced
                            by the reception of the Queen’s proclamation has not been without its
                            influence upon opinion here. Whilst people of all classes unite in
                            declaring that such a measure was unavoidable, they are equally earnest
                            in disavowing any inferences of want of good will which may have been
                            drawn from it. They affect to consider our complaints as very
                            unreasonable, and are profuse in their professions of sympathy with the
                            government in its present struggle. This is, certainly, a very great
                            change from the tone prevailing when I first arrived. It is partly to be
                            ascribed to the accounts of the progress of the war, but still more to
                            the publications in the London <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> of the
                            letters of its special correspondent. There is no longer any floating
                            doubt of the capacity of the government to sustain itself, or any belief
                            that the insurgents will make their own terms of accommodation. The idea
                            still remains quite general that there will never be any actual
                            conflict, and it is connected in many cases with an apprehension that
                            the reunion may be cemented upon the basis of hostile measures against
                            Great Britain. Indeed, such has been the motive hinted at by more than
                            one person of influence as guiding the policy of the President himself.
                            Whenever such a suggestion has been <pb n="110" xml:id="pg_110"
                                facs="0110"/> made to me, I have been careful to discountenance it
                            altogether, and to affirm that the struggle was carried on in good
                            faith, and from motives not subject to be affected by mere
                            considerations of policy, or by temporary emotions. More especially have
                            I endeavored to disavow any “arrière pensée” which has the effect to
                            confirm the suspicion of our sincerity, I regret to say, by far too much
                            disseminated. * * * * *</p>
                        <p rend="center">* * * * * * * *</p>
                        <p>I am now earnestly assured on all sides that the sympathy with the
                            government of the United States is general; that the indignation felt in
                            America is not founded in reason; that the British desire only to be
                            perfectly neutral, giving no aid nor comfort to the insurgents. I
                            believe that this sentiment is now growing to be universal. It inspires
                            her Majesty’s ministers, and is not without its effect on the
                            opposition. Neither party would be so bold as to declare its sympathy
                            with a cause based upon the extension of slavery, for that would at once
                            draw upon itself the indignation of the great body of the people. But
                            the development of a positive spirit in the opposite direction will
                            depend far more upon the degree in which the arm of the government
                            enforces obedience than upon any absolute affinity in sentiments. Our
                            brethren in this country, after all, are much disposed to fall in with
                            the opinion of Voltaire, that “Dieu est toujours sur le coté des gros
                            canons.” General Scott and an effective blockading squardron will be the
                            true agents to keep the peace abroad, as well as to conquer one at home.
                            In the meanwhile the self-styled commissioners of the insurgents have
                            transferred their labors to Paris, where, I am told, they give out what
                            they could not venture publicly to say here, that this government will
                            recognize them as a State. The prediction may be verified, it is true;
                            but it is not now likely to happen, under any other condition than the
                            preceding assent of the United States.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: * * * * * * * *</p>
                        <p>My interview with his lordship was intended only to express to him the
                            views entertained by the President, as communicated to me in your
                            despatches No. 14 and No. 15 of the reports made by me of our first
                            conference. His lordship said that he had just received despatches as
                            late as the 15th, communicating the same information, and that Lord
                            Lyons had learned, through another member of the diplomatic corps, that
                            no further expression of opinion on the subject in question would be
                            necessary. This led to the most frank and pleasant conversation which I
                            have yet had with his lordship, in which we reviewed the various points
                            of difficulty that had arisen in a manner too desultory to admit of
                            reporting, excepting in the general result. * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
                            * * I added that I believed the popular feeling in the United States
                            would subside the moment that all the later action on this side was
                            known. There <pb n="111" xml:id="pg_111" facs="0111"/> was but a single
                            drawback remaining, which was what I could not but regard as the
                            inopportune despatch of the Great Eastern with the troops for Canada. He
                            said that this was a mere precaution against times of trouble.</p>
                        <p rend="center">* * * * * * </p>
                        <p>His lordship then said something about difficulties in New Granada, and
                            the intelligence that the insurgents had undertaken to close several of
                            their ports. But the law officers here told him that this could not be
                            done as against foreign nations, excepting by the regular form of
                            blockade. He did not know what we thought about it, but he had observed
                            that some such plan was said to be likely to be adopted, at the coming
                            meeting of Congress, in regard to the ports of those whom we considered
                            as insurgents. I replied that such was one of the several projects
                            reported at the last session of Congress, to which I was a member, but I
                            had heard some serious constitutional objections raised against it. My
                            own opinion was that the blockade would be persevered in, which would
                            obviate all difficulty.</p>
                        <p>On the whole, I think I can say that the relations of the two countries
                            are gradually returning to a more friendly condition. My own reception
                            has been all that I could desire. I attach value to this, however, only
                            as it indicates the establishment of a policy that will keep us at peace
                            during the continuance of the present convulsion.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your despatch No. 8 (dated June 14) has
                            been received.</p>
                        <p>My despatch, No. 21, of 19th ultimo, has anticipated the matter you have
                            discussed in the paper before me. It remains only to say that while we
                            would prefer to add Mr. Marcy’s amendment, exempting private property of
                            non-belligerents from confiscation in maritime war, and desire you to
                            stipulate to that effect if you can, yet we are, nevertheless, ready and
                            willing to accede to the declaration of the congress of Paris, if the
                            amendment cannot be obtained. In other words, we stand on the
                            instructions contained in my aforesaid despatch.</p>
                        <p>We, as you are well aware, have every desire for a good understanding
                            with the British government. It causes us no concern that the government
                            sends a naval force into the Gulf and a military force into Canada. We
                            can have no designs hostile to Great Britain so long as she does not,
                            officially or unofficially, recognize the insurgents or render them aid
                            or sympathy. We regard the measures of precaution on her part, to which
                            I have alluded, as consequences of the misunderstanding of our rights
                            and her own real relation towards us that she seemed precipitately to
                            adopt, before she heard the communication with which you were charged on
                            our behalf. These consequences may be inconvenient to herself, but are
                            not all occasion of irritation to the United States. Under present
                            circumstances, the more effectually Great Britain guards her possessions
                            and her commerce in this quarter the better we shall be satisfied. If
                            she should change her course and do us any injury, which we have not the
                            least idea now that she <pb n="112" xml:id="pg_112" facs="0112"/>
                            purposes to do, we should not be deterred from vindicating our rights
                            and our unbroken sovereignty against all the armies and navies that she
                            could send here.</p>
                        <p>Before the Queen’s proclamation was issued, and at the moment when
                            privateers were invited and a naval force announced as being organized
                            by the insurrectionists, it was reported to this government that the
                            iron steamer Peerless, lying at Toronto, had been sold to insurgents to
                            be used as a privateer to prey upon our commerce, and that she was,
                            nevertheless, to pass under British papers and the British flag down the
                            St. Lawrence to be delivered over to a pirate commander in the open sea.
                            It was said that the governor general declined to interfere. I asked
                            Lord Lyons to request the governor general of Canada to look into the
                            facts, and prevent the departure of the vessel if he should find the
                            report to be true. Lord Lyons answered that he had no authority to do
                            so. I then said that I should direct our naval forces to seize and
                            detain the vessel if they should have good reason to believe the facts
                            reported to be true, and to refer the parties interested to this
                            government. I did this at once, and his lordship protested. Afterwards,
                            as we understand, the governor general did interfere, and the Peerless
                            was prevented from sailing until the danger of her being converted into
                            a pirate was prevented. Here the matter ended. Certainly the British
                            government could not expect us to permit the St. Lawrence to become a
                            harbor for buccaneers. Had the vessel been seized or detained we should
                            at once have avowed the act and tendered any satisfaction to the British
                            government if it should appear that the character of the vessel had been
                            misunderstood.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Ashmun went to Canada to watch and prevent just such transactions as
                            the sale or fitting out of the Peerless for a pirate would have been. It
                            was not supposed that his visit there would be thought objectionable, or
                            could give any uneasiness to the British government. Lord. Lyons here
                            viewed the subject in a different light and complained of it. I
                            instantly recalled Mr. Ashmun.</p>
                        <p>These are the two grievances presented to you by Lord John Russell. I
                            trust that the British government will be satisfied that in both cases
                            we were only taking care that the peace of the two countries should not
                            be disturbed through the unlawful action of covetous and ill-disposed
                            persons on the border which separates them.</p>
                        <p>I conclude with the remark that the British government can never expect
                            to induce the United States to acquiesce in her assumed position of this
                            government as divided in any degree into two powers for war more than
                            for peace. At the same time, if her Majesty’s government shall continue
                            to practice absolute forbearance from any interference in our domestic
                            affairs, we shall not be captious enough to inquire what name it gives
                            to that forbearance, or in what character it presents itself before the
                            British nation in doing so. We hold ourselves entitled to regard the
                            forbearance as an act of a friendly power, acting unconsciously of a
                            domestic disturbance among us, of which friendly States can take no
                            cognizance. On this point our views are not likely to undergo any
                            change. In maintaining this position we are sure we do nothing
                            derogating from the dignity of the British government, while we
                            inflexibly maintain and preserve the just rights and the honor of the
                            United States.</p>
                        <p>I am, sir, respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your despatches, from No. 2 to No. 25,
                            inclusive, were received at this office early in the present week.</p>
                        <p>I have read the first of these papers, containing further instructions to
                            me, and dated on the 21st of June, with close attention. My prevailing
                            feeling has been one of profound surprise at the course of this
                            government throughout the present difficulty. First. It prepares, in the
                            form of an instruction to Lord Lyons, a paper to be presented to you,
                            among other things “virtually asking you to concede the principles laid
                            down in the declaration of the congress held in Paris in 1856.”
                            Secondly. When in obedience to my instructions I propose to offer a
                            project to Lord John Russell, actually designed to do the very thing
                            desired, I am told the directions have already been sent out to Lord
                            Lyons to arrange the matter on the basis proposed by the American
                            government of the three articles, omitting the fourth altogether.
                            Thirdly. Lord Lyons expresses the opinion to you that his instructions
                            do not authorize him to enter into a convention with you in the United
                            States. Fourthly. When, concurrently with these events, Mr. Dayton
                            proposes to negotiate on the same basis with France, I am informed that
                            this proposal has been communicated to the ministry here, and that no
                            definite conclusion had been arrived at. I must say that a more
                            remarkable series of misunderstandings has seldom come within my
                            observation.</p>
                        <p>I now propose to bring this matter to a distinct issue. To this end I
                            have addressed a letter to Lord John Russell, to know whether, under the
                            renewed instructions of the present despatch, he is disposed to open the
                            negotiation here. The advantage of this will be that I shall get an
                            answer in writing, which will admit of no misconception. A copy of that
                            answer will be forwarded so soon as it is received.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your despatch, No. 32, dated the 1st of
                            July, relating to the communications between the two governments
                            respecting the declaration of the convention at Paris, in 1856, reached
                            me soon after I had addressed a formal letter to Lord John Russell,
                            designed to bring the matter to a definite point. In my No. 14, dated on
                            the 12th, I stated the fact that I had sent such a letter, and I
                            promised that I would forward his lordship’s answer so soon as it should
                            be received. I now transmit copies of my letter and of the answer.</p>
                        <p>It is not a little singular that his lordship’s memory of what passed at
                            our first interview on this subject should differ so widely from mine.
                            It would seem, by his account, that he had been the first to mention the
                            instructions to Lord Lyons to propose a negotiation on the subject of
                            the declaration of Paris, and that I had thereupon expressed the opinion
                            that it would be well to leave it in your hands, in which opinion he
                            fully concurred.</p>
                        <pb n="114" xml:id="pg_114" facs="0114"/>
                        <p>On my side, I am quite certain that the discussion which actually took
                            place between us involved a wholly different class of topics of a very
                            critical nature, and never touched upon the declaration of Paris, until
                            it had exhausted itself on the others. It was by that time late, and I
                            then opened the new subject by remarking that there would be no time to
                            do more than to allude to it at this conference. I first mentioned the
                            fact that I had instructions to propose a negotiation upon the disputed
                            point of the Paris declarations, and the necessary powers to perfect an
                            agreement, if her Majesty’s government were disposed to enter into it.
                            It was this proposal that elicited the explanations of his lordship as
                            to what had been already done, and the expression of an opinion that the
                            instructions sent to Lord Lyons were of such a kind as to make some
                            agreement on your side so very likely as to render any treatment of the
                            same matter here unadvisable; and it was then that I concurred in his
                            opinion.</p>
                        <p>As things now stand, perhaps this difference of recollection in the
                            present instance may not be material. But there might be cases in which
                            it would be of so much moment that I think hereafter I shall prefer,
                            upon essential points, to conduct the affairs of this legation a little
                            more in writing than I have heretofore thought necessary.</p>
                        <p>At the hour appointed in his note, I waited upon his lordship for the
                            first time, at his official residence in Downing street. After comparing
                            our respective remembrance of the facts in dispute, I went on to repeat
                            what I maintained I had at first proposed, to wit: that I was ready to
                            negotiate if her Majesty’s government were so disposed. To that end I
                            had brought ray powers, and also the project of a convention, copies of
                            both of which papers I offered to leave with him. He remarked that at
                            this stage it was not necessary to look at the powers. The other one he
                            took and examined. The first remark which he made was that it was
                            essentially the declaration of Paris. He had never known until now that
                            the government of the United States were disposed to accede to it. He
                            was sure that I had never mentioned it. To this I assented, but observed
                            that the reason why I had not done so was that my government had
                            directed me to make a preliminary inquiry, and that was to know whether
                            her Majesty’s ministers were disposed to enter into any negotiation at
                            all. It was because of <hi rend="italic">my</hi> understanding his
                            lordship to say that he preferred to leave the matter with Lord Lyons,
                            that I had considered negotiation here to be declined. I had also heard,
                            through his lordship, of a proposition since made by Mr. Dayton on this
                            subject to the French government, and which had been communicated to
                            him, that led me to suppose the matter might be taking its shape at
                            Paris. His lordship observed that Mr. Dayton’s proposal was nothing more
                            than a repetition of that made by Mr. Marcy, which they were not willing
                            to accede to. I then said that Mr. Marcy’s amendment was undoubtedly the
                            first wish of my government. I also had instructions to press it, if
                            there was the smallest probability of success; but I understood that
                            this matter had been definitively settled. His lordship signified his
                            assent to this remark, and added that I might consider the proposition
                            as inadmissible. He would therefore take the copy of the project of a
                            convention which I had offered him, for the purpose of submitting it to
                            the consideration of his colleagues in the cabinet, and let me know when
                            he should be ready to meet again.</p>
                        <p>In the course of conversation, I took the occasion to remark upon that
                            passage of his lordship’s note to me which related to the manner in
                            which other states had signified their adherence to the declaration. I
                            called his attention to the fact that, whatever might be the course
                            elsewhere, the peculiar structure of our government required some
                            distinct form of agreement or convention to be made with foreign States
                            upon which the Senate could exercise their legitimate authority of
                            confirmation or rejection. He <pb n="115" xml:id="pg_115" facs="0115"/>
                            seemed at once to understand the force of this observation, and to
                            assent to the necessity. Yet I foresaw at the time, the difficulty in
                            which it would place the British government in its relations with the
                            other parties to the convention at Paris. The reply of his lordship,
                            this moment come to hand, a copy of which is herewith submitted,
                            explains it fully, and leaves the matter in the same state of suspense
                            that it was in before.</p>
                        <p>Under these circumstances, and presuming it to be the wish of the
                            President that no time be lost, I shall write to Mr. Dayton, at Paris,
                            to know whether he considers himself authorized to proceed to conclude a
                            similar arrangement with the French government; if so, I shall try to go
                            on without waiting for further instructions; if not, I shall hold myself
                            ready to act here so soon as this difficulty shall have been removed
                            elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant,</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Lord</hi>: From the tenor of the last
                                despatches received from the Department of State at Washington, I am
                                led to suppose that there has been some misunderstanding in regard
                                to the intentions of her Majesty’s government respecting a proposal
                                to negotiate upon the basis of the declaration of the congress held
                                at Paris in 1856. In the first conversation which I had the honor to
                                hold with your lordship, so long ago as the 18th of May last, in
                                answer to an offer then made by myself, under instructions from my
                                government, I certainly understood your lordship to say that the
                                subject had already been committed to the care of Lord Lyons, at
                                Washington, with authority to accept the proposition of the
                                government of the United States, adopting three articles of the
                                declaration at Paris, and to drop the fourth altogether. For this
                                reason you preferred not to enter into the question on this side of
                                the water. I am now informed that Lord Lyons thinks his instructions
                                do not authorize him to enter into convention with the authorities
                                at Washington, and am instructed to apprise her Majesty’s government
                                of the fact.</p>
                            <p>Under these circumstances, I am directed once more to renew the
                                proposition here, and to say that, if agreeable to your lordship, I
                                am prepared to present to your consideration a project of a
                                convention at any moment which it may be convenient to you to
                                appoint.</p>
                            <p>Seizing the occasion to renew the assurance of my highest
                                consideration,</p>
                            <p>I have the honor to be your lordship’s most obedient servant,</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have just had the honor to receive
                                your letter dated the 11th instant. In the first conversation I had
                                the honor to hold with you, on the 18th of <pb n="116"
                                    xml:id="pg_116" facs="0116"/> May, I informed you that
                                instructions had been sent to Lord Lyons to propose to the
                                government of the United States to adopt the second, third, and
                                fourth articles of the declaration of Paris, dropping the first
                                altogether.</p>
                            <p>You informed me that you had instructions on the same subject; but I
                                understood you to express an opinion, in which I fully concurred,
                                that it would be well to leave the question in the hands of the
                                Secretary of State at Washington.</p>
                            <p>Lord Lyons had instructions to make an agreement with the government
                                of the United States, but he had no express authority to sign a
                                convention.</p>
                            <p>The States who have adhered to the declaration of Paris have
                                generally, if not invariably, done so by despatches or notes, and
                                not by conventions.</p>
                            <p>As, however, you have been instructed to present to her Majesty’s
                                government, for consideration, a project of a convention, I shall be
                                happy to see you at the foreign office at three o’clock to-day, for
                                the purpose of receiving that project.</p>
                            <p>I request you to receive the assurance of my highest consideration,
                                and have the honor to be, sir, your most obedient servant,</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Upon considering your propositions of
                                Saturday last I have two remarks to make.</p>
                            <p>First. The course hitherto followed has been a simple notification of
                                adherence to the declaration of Paris by those states which were not
                                originally parties to it.</p>
                            <p>Secondly. The declaration of Paris was one embracing various powers,
                                with a view to general concurrence upon questions of maritime law,
                                and not an insulated engagement between two powers only.</p>
                            <p>Her Majesty’s government are willing to waive entirely any objection
                                on the first of these heads, and to accept the form which the
                                government of the United States prefers.</p>
                            <p>With regard to the second, her Majesty’s government are of opinion
                                that they should be assured that the United States are ready to
                                enter into a similar engagement with France, and with other maritime
                                powers who are parties to the declaration of Paris, and do not
                                purpose to make singly and separately a convention with Great
                                Britain only.</p>
                            <p>But as much time might be required for separate communications
                                between the government of the United States and all the maritime
                                powers who were parties to or have acceded to the declaration of
                                Paris, her Majesty’s government would deem themselves authorized to
                                advise the Queen to conclude a convention on this subject with the
                                President of the United States so soon as they shall have been
                                informed that a similar convention has been agreed upon, and is
                                ready for signature, between the President of the United States and
                                the Emperor of the French, so that the two conventions might be
                                signed simultaneously and on the same day.</p>
                            <p>I have the honor to be, with the highest consideration, sir, your

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your despatch of June 28, No. 10, has been
                            received.</p>
                        <p>I have already, in a previous communication, informed you that this
                            government has not been disturbed by the action of the British
                            authorities in sending three regiments into Canada, nor by the
                            announcement of the coming of British armed vessels into American
                            waters. These movements are certainly not very formidable in their
                            proportions; and we willingly accept the explanation that they proceed
                            from merely prudential motives.</p>
                        <p>Doubtless it had been better if they had not been made. But what
                            government can say that it never acts precipitately, or even
                            capriciously. On our part the possibility of foreign intervention,
                            sooner or later, in this domestic disturbance is never absent from the
                            thoughts of this government. We are, therefore, not likely to exaggerate
                            indications of an emergency for which we hold ourselves bound to be in a
                            measure always prepared.</p>
                        <p>Another subject which, according to your report, was discussed in your
                            late interview with Lord John Russell demands more extended remarks. I
                            refer to the portion of your despatch which is in these words: “His
                            lordship then said something about difficulties in New Grenada, and the
                            intelligence that the insurgents there had passed a law to close their
                            ports. But the law officers here told him that this could not be done as
                            against foreign nations, except by the regular form of a blockade. He
                            did not know what we thought about it; but he had observed that some
                            such plan was said to be likely to be adopted at the coming meeting of
                            Congress in regard to the ports of those whom we considered as
                            insurgents.”</p>
                        <p>Much as I deprecate a reference in official communications of this kind
                            to explanations made by ministers in Parliament, not always fully or
                            accurately reported, and always liable to be perverted when applied to
                            cases not considered when the explanations are given, I nevertheless
                            find it necessary, by way of elucidating the subject, to bring into this
                            connexion the substance of a debate which is said to have taken place in
                            the House of Commons on the 27th of June last, and which is as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p>Mr. H. Berkly asked the secretary of state for foreign affairs whether
                            her Majesty’s government recognized a notification given by Señor
                            Martin, minister plenipotentiary to this court from the Grenadian
                            confederation, better known as the Republic of New Grenada, which
                            announces a blockade of the ports of Rio Hacha, Santa Marta, Savanilla,
                            Carthagena, and Zaporte, and which government did her Majesty’s
                            government recognize in the so-called Grenadian confederation.</p>
                        <p>Lord John Russell said the question is one of considerable importance.
                            The government of New Grenada has announced, not a blockade, but that
                            certain ports of New Grenada are to be closed. The opinion of her
                            Majesty’s government, after taking legal advice, is, that it is
                            perfectly competent for the government of a country in a state of
                            tranquillity to say which ports shall be open to trade and which shall
                            be closed; but in the event of insurrection or civil war in that
                            country, it is not competent for its government to close the ports that
                            are <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> in the hands of the insurgents, as
                            that would be an invasion of international law with regard to blockade.
                            Admiral Milne, acting on instructions from her Majesty’s government, has
                            ordered the commanders of her Majesty’s ships not to recognize the
                            closing of their ports.</p>
                        <p>Since your conversation with Lord John Russell, and also since the debate
                            which I have extracted occurred, the Congress of the United States has
                            by <pb n="118" xml:id="pg_118" facs="0118"/> law asserted the right of
                            this government to close the ports in this country which have been
                            seized by the insurgents.</p>
                        <p>I send you herewith a copy of the enactment. The connecting by Lord John
                            Russell of that measure when it was in prospect with what had taken
                            place in regard to a law of New Granada, gives to the remarks which he
                            made to you a significance that requires no especial illustration. If
                            the government of the United States should close their insurrectionary
                            ports under the new statute, and Great Britain should, in pursuance of
                            the intimation made, disregard the act, no one can suppose for a moment
                            that the United States would acquiesce. When a conflict on such a
                            question shall arrive between the United States and Great Britain, it is
                            not easily to be seen what maritime nation could keep aloof from it. It
                            must be confessed, therefore, that a new incident has occurred
                            increasing the danger that what has hitherto been, and, as we think,
                            ought to be, a merely domestic controversy of our own, may be enlarged
                            into a general war among the great maritime nations. Hence the necessity
                            for endeavoring to bring about a more perfect understanding between the
                            United States and Great Britain for the regulation of their mutual
                            relations than has yet been attained.</p>
                        <p>In attempting that important object I may be allowed to begin by
                            affirming that the President deprecates, as much as any citizen of
                            either country or any friend of humanity throughout the world can
                            deprecate, the evil of foreign wars, to be superinduced, as he thinks
                            unnecessarily, upon the painful civil conflict in which we are engaged
                            for the purpose of defending and maintaining our national authority over
                            our own disloyal citizens.</p>
                        <p>I may add, also, for myself, that however otherwise I may at any time
                            have been understood, it has been an earnest and profound solicitude to
                            avert foreign war; that alone has prompted the emphatic and sometimes,
                            perhaps, impassioned remonstrances I have hitherto made against any form
                            or measure of recognition of the insurgents by the government of Great
                            Britain. I write in the same spirit now; and I invoke on the part of the
                            British government, as I propose to exercise on my own, the calmness
                            which all counsellors ought to practise in debates which involve the
                            peace and happiness of mankind.</p>
                        <p>The United States and Great Britain have assumed incompatible, and thus
                            far irreconcilable, positions on the subject of the existing
                            insurrection.</p>
                        <p>The United States claim and insist that the integrity of the republic is
                            unbroken, and that their government is supreme so far as foreign nations
                            are concerned, as well for war as for peace, over all the States, all
                            sections, and all citizens, the loyal not more than the disloyal, the
                            patriots and the insurgents alike. Consequently they insist that the
                            British government shall in no way intervene in the insurrection, or
                            hold commercial or other intercourse with the insurgents in derogation
                            of the federal authority.</p>
                        <p>The British government, without having first deliberately heard the
                            claims of the United States, announced, through a proclamation of the
                            Queen, that it took notice of the insurrection as a civil war so
                            flagrant as to divide this country into two belligerent parties, of
                            which the federal government constitutes one and the disloyal citizens
                            the other; and consequently it inferred a right of Great Britain to
                            stand in an attitude of neutrality between them.</p>
                        <p>It is not my purpose at this time to vindicate the position of the United
                            States, nor is it my purpose to attempt to show to the government of
                            Great Britain that its position is indefensible.</p>
                        <p>The question at issue concerns the United States primarily, and Great
                            Britain only secondarily and incidentally. It is, as I have before said,
                            a question of the integrity, which is nothing less than the life of the
                            republic itself.</p>
                        <p>The position which the government has taken has been dictated, therefore,
                                <pb n="119" xml:id="pg_119" facs="0119"/> by the law of
                            self-preservation. No nation animated by loyal sentiments and inspired
                            by a generous ambition can even suffer itself to debate with parties
                            within or without a policy of self-preservation. In assuming this
                            position and the policy resulting from it, we have done, as I think,
                            just what Great Britain herself must, and therefore would do if a
                            domestic insurrection should attempt to detach Ireland, or Scotland, or
                            England from the United Kingdom, while she would hear no argument nor
                            enter into any debate upon the subject. Neither adverse opinions of
                            theoretical writers, nor precedents drawn from the practice of other
                            nations, or, even if they could be, from her own, would modify her
                            course, which would be all the more vigorously followed if internal
                            resistance should fortify itself with alliances throughout the world.
                            This is exactly the case now with the United States.</p>
                        <p>So, for obvious reasons, I refrain from argument to prove to the
                            government of Great Britain the assumed error of the position it has
                            avowed.</p>
                        <p>First. Argument from a party that maintains itself to be absolutely
                            right, and resolved in no case to change its convictions, becomes merely
                            controversial. Secondly. Such argument would be only an indirect way of
                            defending our own position, which is unchangeable. Thirdly. The position
                            of Great Britain has been taken upon the assumption of a certain degree
                            of probability of success by the insurgents in arms; and it must be
                            sooner or later abandoned, as that probability shall diminish and
                            ultimately cease, while in any case that circumstance does not affect
                            our position or the policy which we have adopted. It must, therefore, be
                            left to Great Britain to do what we have done, namely, survey the entire
                            field, with the consequences of her course deemed by us to be erroneous,
                            and determine as those consequences develope themselves how long that
                            course shall be pursued.</p>
                        <p>While, however, thus waiving controversy on the main point, I am tempted
                            by a sincere conviction that Great Britain really must desire, as we do,
                            that the peace of the world may not be unnecessarily broken, to consider
                            the attitude of the two powers, with a view to mutual forbearance, until
                            reconciliation of conflicting systems shall have become in every event
                            impossible.</p>
                        <p>The British government will, I think, admit that so soon as its
                            unexpected, and, as we regard it, injurious position assumed in the
                            Queen’s proclamation became known to us, we took some pains to avert
                            premature or unnecessary collision, if it could be done without
                            sacrificing any part of the sovereignty which we had determined in every
                            event to defend. We promptly renewed the proposition which, fortunately
                            for both parties, we had tendered before that proclamation was issued,
                            to concede as one whole undivided sovereignty to Great Britain, as a
                            friend, all the guarantees for her commerce that she might claim as a
                            neutral from this government as one of her two imagined belligerents. It
                            seemed to us that these two great and kindred nations might decline to
                            be dogmatic, and act practically with a view to immediate peace and
                            ultimate good understanding.</p>
                        <p>So, on the other hand, it is my duty to admit, as I most frankly do, that
                            the directions given by the British government that our blockade shall
                            be respected, and that favor or shelter shall be denied to insurgent
                            privateers, together with the disallowance of the application of the
                            insurgent commissioners, have given us good reason to expect that our
                            complete sovereignty, though theoretically questioned in the Queen’s
                            proclamation, would be practically respected. Lord Lyons, as you are
                            aware, proposed to read to me a despatch which he had received from his
                            government, affirming the position assumed in the Queen’s proclamation,
                            and deducing from that position claims as a neutral to guarantees of
                            safety to British commerce less than those we had, as I have already
                            stated, offered to her as a friend. I declined, <pb n="120"
                                xml:id="pg_120" facs="0120"/> as you have been advised, to hear the
                            communication, but nevertheless renewed through you, as I consistently
                            could, the offer of the greater guarantees before tendered.</p>
                        <p>The case then seemed to me to stand thus: The two nations had, indeed,
                            failed to find a common ground or principle on which they could stand
                            together; but they had succeeded in reaching a perfect understanding of
                            the nature and extent of their disagreement, and in finding a line of
                            mutual, practical forbearance. It was under this aspect of the positions
                            of the two governments that the President thought himself authorized to
                            inform Congress on its coming together on the 4th of July instant, in
                            extra session that the sovereignty of the United States was practically
                            respected by all nations.</p>
                        <p>Nothing has occurred to change this condition of affairs, unless it be
                            the attitude which Lord John Russell has indicated for the British
                            government in regard to an apprehended closing of the insurrectionary
                            ports, and the passage of the law of Congress which authorizes that
                            measure in the discretion of the President.</p>
                        <p>It is my purpose not to anticipate or even indicate the decision which
                            will be made, but simply to suggest to you what you may properly and
                            advantageously say while the subject is under consideration. First. You
                            will, of course, prevent misconception of the measure by stating that
                            the law only authorizes the President to close the ports in his
                            discretion, according as he shall regard exigencies now existing or
                            hereafter to arise.</p>
                        <p>Secondly. The passage of the law, taken in connexion with attendant
                            circumstances, does not necessarily indicate a legislative conviction
                            that the ports ought to be closed, but only shows the purpose of
                            Congress that the closing of the ports, if it is now or shall become
                            necessary, shall not fail for want of power explicitly conferred by law.
                            When, on the 13th of April last, disloyal citizens defiantly inaugurated
                            an armed insurrection by the bombardment of Fort Sumter, the President’s
                            constitutional obligation to suppress the insurrection became
                            imperative.</p>
                        <p>But the case was new, and had not been adequately provided for by express
                            law. The President called military and naval forces into activity,
                            instituted a blockade, and incurred great expense, for all which no
                            direct legal provisions existed. He convened Congress at the earliest
                            possible day to confirm these measures, if they should see fit.</p>
                        <p>Congress, when it came together, confronted these facts. It has employed
                            itself less in directing how and in what way the Union shall be
                            maintained, than in confirming what the President had already done, and
                            in putting into his hands more ample means and greater power than he has
                            exercised or asked.</p>
                        <p>The law in question was passed in this generous and patriotic spirit.
                            Whether it shall be put into execution to-day or to-morrow, or at what
                            time, will depend on the condition of things at home and abroad, and a
                            careful weighing of the advantages of so stringent a measure against
                            those which are derived from the existing blockade.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly. You may assure the British government that no change of policy
                            now pursued, injuriously affecting foreign commerce, will be made from
                            motives of aggression against nations which practically respect the
                            sovereignty of the United States, or without due consideration of all
                            the circumstances, foreign as well as domestic, bearing upon the
                            question. The same spirit of forbearance towards foreign nations,
                            arising from a desire to confine the calamities of the unhappy contest
                            as much as possible, and to bring it to a close by the complete
                            restoration of the authority of the government <pb n="121"
                                xml:id="pg_121" facs="0121"/> as speedily as possible, that have
                            hitherto regulated the action of the government will continue to control
                            its counsels.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, you will not leave it at all doubtful that the
                            President fully adheres to the position that this government so early
                            adopted, and which I have so continually throughout this controversy
                            maintained; consequently he fully agrees with Congress in the principle
                            of the law which authorizes him to close the ports which have been
                            seized by the insurgents, and he will put into execution and maintain it
                            with all the means at his command, at the hazard of whatever
                            consequences, whenever it shall appear that the safety of the nation
                            requires it.</p>
                        <p>I cannot leave the subject without endeavoring once more, as I have so
                            often done before, to induce the British government to realize the
                            conviction which I have more than once expressed in this correspondence,
                            that the policy of the government is one that is based on interests of
                            the greatest importance, and sentiments of the highest virtue, and
                            therefore is in no case likely to be changed, whatever may be the
                            varying fortunes of the war at home or the action of foreign nations on
                            this subject, while the policy of foreign States rests on ephemeral
                            interests of commerce or of ambition merely. The policy of these United
                            States is not a creature of the government but an inspiration of the
                            people, while the policies of foreign States are at the choice mainly of
                            the governments presiding over them. If, through error, on whatever side
                            this civil contention shall transcend the national bounds and involve
                            foreign States, the energies of all commercial nations, including our
                            own, will necessarily be turned to war, and a general carnival of the
                            adventurous and the reckless of all countries, at the cost of the
                            existing commerce of the world, must ensue. Beyond that painful scene
                            upon the seas there lie, but dimly concealed from our vision, scenes of
                            devastation and desolation which will leave no roots remaining out of
                            which trade between the United States and Great Britain, as it has
                            hitherto flourished, can ever again spring up.</p>
                        <p>I am, sir, respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: At the close of my despatch, No. 11, on
                            the subject of my last conference with Lord John Russell, I mentioned my
                            intention to write to Mr. Dayton, at Paris, to know whether he felt
                            authorized to proceed in a simultaneous negotiation on the subject of
                            the declaration of the congress at Paris. I have now to report that I
                            executed my purpose on the 19th instant.</p>
                        <p>On the evening of the 24th I received a note from Mr. Dayton announcing
                            his arrival in town and his wish to confer with me upon this matter.
                            Yesterday morning I had the pleasure of a full and free conversation
                            with him, in the course of which we carefully compared our respective
                            instructions and the action taken under them.</p>
                        <p>I am very glad he has taken the trouble to come over to see me, for I
                            confess that I was a little embarrassed by not knowing the precise
                            nature of his proposal to the French government at the time when I heard
                            of it from Lord John Russell. Had I been informed of it I should perhaps
                            have shaped my own course a little differently. So I doubt not that he
                            would <pb n="122" xml:id="pg_122" facs="0122"/> have been pleased to
                            know more exactly my own proceedings as well as the more specific
                            character of my instructions. An hour’s interview has had the effect to
                            correct our impressions better than could have been accomplished by an
                            elaborate correspondence.</p>
                        <p>I can now perfectly understand as well as enter into the reasons which
                            prompted his proposal of the declaration of Paris, connected as it was
                            with the modification first suggested by Mr. Marcy. There can be no
                            doubt that the attempt to secure such an extension of the application of
                            the principle contained in the first point of that declaration was worth
                            making, on the part of the new administration, particularly at a place
                            where there was no reason to presume any disinclination to adopt it.
                            Neither did the reply of Mr. Thouvenel entirely preclude the hope of
                            ultimate success, so far as the disposition of France may be
                            presumed.</p>
                        <p>The obstacles, if any there are, must be inferred to have been thought to
                            exist elsewhere. And an advance could be expected only when the efforts
                            to remove them had been applied with effect in the proper quarter. It
                            was, therefore, both natural and proper for Mr. Dayton, after having
                            made his offer, and received such an answer, to wait patiently until it
                            should become apparent that such efforts had been made, and made without
                            success.</p>
                        <p>There can be no doubt that the opposition to this modification centres
                            here. Independently of the formal announcement of Lord John Russell to
                            me that the proposition was declined, I have, from other sources of
                            information, some reason to believe that it springs from the tenacity of
                            a class of influential persons, by their age and general affinities,
                            averse to all sudden variations from established ideas. Such people are
                            not to be carried away by novel reasoning, however forcible. We have
                            cause to feel the presence of a similar power at home, though in a
                            vastly reduced degree.</p>
                        <p>All modifications of the public law, however beneficent, naturally meet
                            with honest resistance in these quarters for a time. It is to be feared
                            that this may have the effect of defeating, at this moment, the
                            application of the noble doctrines of the declaration of Paris, in the
                            full expansion of which they are susceptible. But to my mind the failure
                            to reach that extreme point will not justify the United States in
                            declining to accept the good which is actually within their grasp. The
                            declaration of the leading powers of civilized Europe, made at Paris in
                            1856, engrafted upon the law of nations for the first time great
                            principles for which the government of the United States had always
                            contended against some of those powers, and down to that time had
                            contended in vain.</p>
                        <p>That great act was the virtual triumph of their policy all over the
                            globe. It was the sacrifice, on the part of Great Britain, of notions
                            she had ever before held to with the most unrelenting rigidity. It would
                            therefore seem as if any reluctance to acknowledge this practical amount
                            of benefit, obtained on the mere ground that something remained to
                            require, was calculated only to wither the laurels gained by our
                            victory.</p>
                        <p>It would almost seem like a retrograde tendency to the barbarism of
                            former ages. Surely it is not in the spirit of the reformed government
                            in America to give countenance to any such impression. Whatever may have
                            been the character of the policy in later years, the advent of another
                            and a better power should be marked by a recurrence to the best
                            doctrines ever proclaimed in the national history. And if it so happen
                            that they are not now adopted by others to the exact extent that we
                            would prefer, the obvious course of wisdom would seem to be to accept
                            the good which can be obtained, and patiently to await another
                            opportunity when a continuance of exertions in the same direction may
                            enable us to secure everything that is left to be desired.</p>
                        <p>I think that Mr. Dayton has waited only to be convinced that his proposed
                                <pb n="123" xml:id="pg_123" facs="0123"/> modification cannot be
                            secured before he acts upon the authority given him to accede to the
                            declaration of Paris, pure and simple.</p>
                        <p>On my part, I have apprised him of the answer made to me by Lord John
                            Russell at our last conference. Bat he wishes some evidence upon which
                            he can rely a little more securely than a report of conversation. And
                            considering the remarkable discrepancy in the recollection of the
                            conferences with his lordship which has thus far taken place, I am not
                            surprised. In order to meet this difficulty he has addressed to me a
                            letter of inquiry, which I propose to answer. At the same time I design
                            to address a letter to his lordship recapitulating the portion of his
                            conversation that is in question, and informing him that, <hi
                                rend="italic">on the assumption that I understood him right</hi>,
                            Mr. Dayton consents to proceed. This will, of course, render it
                            necessary for him to explain himself, if the fact should be
                            otherwise.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Dayton will, of course, communicate directly with the department as
                            to the later measures which he may think proper to take.</p>
                        <p>You will have been already informed by the newspapers of the changes
                            which the ministry has undergone in consequence of the necessity imposed
                            upon Lord Herbert by his failing health to retire from his post. As a
                            consequence, Lord John Russell has been called to the House of Lords,
                            though retaining his official station, and some shifting of other places
                            has occurred. The only new appointment is that of Sir Robert Peel. * *

                        <p>Our army of the Potomac on Sunday last met a reverse equally severe and
                            unexpected. For a day or two the panic which had produced the result was
                            followed by a panic that seemed to threaten to demoralize the country.
                            But that evil has ceased already. The result is already seen in a
                            vigorous reconstruction upon a scale of greater magnitude and increased
                            enthusiasm.</p>

                            been received.</p>
                        <p>Your proposition of making a distinct appeal to the British government on
                            the subject of the issue between it and this government, upon the
                            questions so long discussed, is approved. We shall look with much
                            interest for the answer of that government.</p>
                        <p>You will hear of a reverse of our arms in Virginia. The exaggerations of
                            the result have been as great as the public impatience, perhaps, which
                            brought it about. But the affair will not produce any serious injury.
                            The strength of the insurrection is not broken, but it is not
                            formidable. The vigor of the government will be increased, and the
                            ultimate result will be a triumph of the Constitution. Do not be misled
                            by panic reports of danger apprehended for the capital.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Lord</hi>: I have the honor now to inform
                                your lordship that, in consonance with the intention expressed in my
                                note of the 19th instant, I have written to Mr. Dayton, at Paris,
                                touching the extent of his powers to negotiate upon the same basis
                                proposed by me to you, with the government of France, to which he is
                                accredited. I have also to say that since the date of my writing I
                                have had the pleasure to converse personally with him as well as to
                                receive a letter from him in answer to my inquiry.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Dayton informs me that, some time since, he made a proposal to
                                the French government to adopt the declaration of the congress of
                                Paris in 1856, with an addition to the first clause, in substance
                                the same with that <pb n="125" xml:id="pg_125" facs="0125"/>
                                heretofore proposed by his predecessor, Mr. Mason, under
                                instructions given by Mr. Marcy, then the Secretary of State of the
                                United States. To that proposal he received an answer from the
                                French minister of foreign affairs, declining to consider the
                                proposition, not for any objection entertained against it, but
                                because it was a variation from the terms of the original agreement
                                requiring a prior reference of it to the other parties to that
                                convention. This answer does not, in his opinion, make the ultimate
                                acceptance of his addition impossible, and he does not feel as if he
                                ought to abandon the support of what he considers as so beneficent
                                an amendment to the original plan until he has reason to despair of
                                success. He has therefore requested to know of me whether I have
                                reason to believe perseverance in this direction to be
                                fruitless.</p>
                            <p>For my part I entirely concur in the view entertained by Mr. Dayton
                                of the value of this amendment. I also know so well the interest
                                that my government takes in its adoption as to be sure that it would
                                refuse to justify a further procedure on our part which was not
                                based upon a reasonable certainty that success is not attainable, at
                                least at the present moment. I have, therefore, ventured to state to
                                Mr. Dayton my belief that I have that certainty. I have therefore
                                mentioned to him, what I have likewise communicated to the proper
                                department of the government of the United States, the fact that in
                                the last conference I had the honor to hold with your lordship,
                                allusion having been made to the amendment of Mr. Dayton, I said
                                that that amendment was undoubtedly the first wish of my government,
                                and that I had instructions to press it if there was the smallest
                                probability of success, but that I supposed this matter to have been
                                already definitively acted upon. To which I understood your lordship
                                to signify your assent, and to add that I might consider the
                                proposition as inadmissible. If I have made no mistake in reporting
                                the substance of what passed between us, Mr. Dayton tells me he is
                                satisfied, and expresses his readiness to proceed on the basis
                                proposed by me to your lordship with the French government. But in
                                order to remove all probability of misconception between him and
                                myself, I have taken the liberty of recalling your lordship’s
                                attention to the matter before it may be too late. Should there have
                                been any essential error of fact on the main point, I trust your
                                lordship will do me the favor to set me right.</p>
                            <p>Should it happen, on the contrary, that I am correct, I believe it
                                will not be necessary to interpose any delay in the negotiation for
                                further reference to the government of the United States. Mr. Dayton
                                will take the necessary steps to apprise the government of the
                                Emperor of the French of his intention to accede to the declaration
                                of Paris, pure and simple, and the negotiations may be carried on
                                simultaneously in both countries as soon as the necessary
                                arrangements can be perfected on the respective sides.</p>
                            <p>However my government may regret that it has not been able to expand
                                the application of the principles of the declaration of Paris to the
                                extent which it deems desirable, it is too well convinced of the
                                great value of the recognition actually given to those principles by
                                the great powers of Europe in that act, longer to hesitate in giving
                                in its cordial adhesion. But it ardently cherishes the hope that
                                time and the favoring progress of correct opinion may before long
                                bring about opportunities for additional developments of the system
                                they initiate, through the co-operation of all maritime nations of
                                the earth, and most especially of one so enlightened and
                                philanthropic as Great Britain.</p>
                            <p>Renewing the assurances of my highest consideration, I have the honor
                                to be your lordship’s most obedient servant,</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have had the honor to receive your
                                letter of the 29th instant, in which you inform me that Mr. Dayton,
                                some time since, made a proposal to the French government to adopt
                                the declaration of the congress of Paris in 1856, with an addition
                                to the first clause, in substance the same with that heretofore
                                proposed by his predecessor, Mr. Mason, under instructions given by
                                Mr. Marcy, then the Secretary of State of the United States. After
                                giving an account of the reception given to that proposition by the
                                French government, and the value attached to it by Mr. Dayton and
                                yourself, you proceed to state that in a conversation with me you
                                told me that the addition proposed was the first wish of your
                                government, and that you had instructiens to press it if there was
                                the smallest probability of success, but that you supposed this
                                matter to have been already definitively acted upon. You represent
                                me as signifying my assent, and adding that I considered the
                                proposition as inadmissible.</p>
                            <p>So far as I am concerned, this statement is perfectly correct.</p>
                            <p>You go on to inform me that in the case of your statement being
                                correct, Mr. Dayton will take the necessary steps to apprise the
                                French government of his intention to accede to the declaration of
                                Paris, “pure and simple, and that the negotiations may be carried on
                                simultaneously in both countries as soon as the necessary
                                arrangements can be perfected on the respective sides.”</p>
                            <p>You will doubtless recollect that in my letter of the 18th instant, I
                                stated that “her Majesty’s government are of opinion that they
                                should be assured that the United States are ready to enter into a
                                similar engagement with France, and with the other maritime powers
                                who are parties to the declaration of Paris, and do not propose to
                                make simply and separately a convention with Great Britain
                                only.”</p>
                            <p>But as I agreed in the same letter to waive this assurance, and as I
                                conclude, in point of fact, the United States are willing to sign
                                similar conventions with all the states parties to the declaration
                                of Paris, I shall be ready to carry on the negotiations as soon as
                                the necessary arrangements can be perfected in London and Paris, so
                                that the conventions may be signed simultaneously at those two
                                capitals.</p>
                            <p>I need scarcely add that on the part of Great Britain the engagement
                                will be prospective, and will not invalidate anything already
                                done.</p>
                            <p>I have the honor to be, with the highest consideration, sir, your
                                most obedient, humble servant,</p>

                            19th, has been received.</p>
                        <p>I entirely approve of the letter which you addressed to Lord John
                            Russell, of the 11th, a copy of which accompanied that despatch, and I
                            wait now with impatience, yet not without some solicitude, for the
                            action of the British government upon our propositions which we so early
                            sent forward in good faith, and which by such strange accidents have
                            been so long in reaching the cabinet of Great Britain.</p>
                        <p>I need hardly tell you that the same mail which conveyed our propositions

                            government, and that of every other maritime power in Europe.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your despatch of July 24th (No. 20) has
                            been received. I am glad that you have had a full and satisfactory
                            conversation with Mr. Dayton. It seems probable that we shall now be
                            able to arrive at an understanding with the governments of Great Britain
                            and France on the subject of international law relating to maritime
                            war.</p>
                        <p>The shock produced by the reverse of our arms at Bull Run has passed
                            away. The army is reorganized; the elections show that reaction against
                            disunion has begun in the revolutionary States, and we may confidently
                            look for a restoration of the national authority throughout the
                            Union.</p>
                        <p>If our foreign relations were once promptly re-established on their
                            former basis, the disunion sentiment would languish and perish within a
                            year.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have read with great attention the
                            contents of your despatch, No. 42, dated the 21st July, and shall avail
                            myself of the argument upon the next occasion of an interview with Lord
                            Russell. But I have not thought it necessary to solicit one, for the
                            reason that the government here does not appear to contemplate any
                            change of position, so long as the blockade shall be kept up.</p>
                        <p>In the last conference which I had with his lordship, I took occasion
                            towards the close of it to intimate to him that he must not infer, from
                            my not having entered into discussion of the merits of the question,
                            that I gave any assent to the position taken by him about the right of a
                            government to close its own ports, when held by forcible possession of
                            persons resisting its authority. On the contrary, I desired to reserve
                            for my government the treatment of it as an open question whenever it
                            should take any practical shape.</p>
                        <p>In the meantime I had every reason to believe that it was the design of
                            the President to persevere in the blockade, and to that end that the
                            necessary forces were in constant process of accumulation. This course,
                            being understood to be one against which his lordship had signified an
                            intention not to raise any objection, I did not think it worth while now
                            to go further. <pb n="128" xml:id="pg_128" facs="0128"/> At the time of
                            this interview no mention had been made of the precise form of the
                            legislation contemplated by Congress. We received more precise
                            intelligence on this side of the water a few days before the prorogation
                            of Parliament. On the very last day for transacting business the subject
                            was brought up in the House of Commons on a question addressed to Lord
                            Palmerston by Mr. Wyld. His lordship’s answer has doubtless attracted
                            your attention long ere this. He considered the law as merely giving a
                            discretionary power. But if carried into practice he construed it as
                            putting an end to the blockade. So that, whether under blockade or under
                            a levy of duties, foreign nations would have a rule to go by. His reply
                            was, however, rather specious than solid, for it did not touch the
                            difficulty presented by the fourth section, nor that involved in a
                            possible levy of a double set of duties, one by the government on
                            ship-board, and another by the insurgents on land. I am inclined to
                            believe that serious objection would be made here in either of these
                            contingencies. For this reason I do not deem it expedient to stir the
                            matter until the necessity for it shall become positive. Believing the
                            government to be on the whole favorably disposed towards us, and also
                            that it is of great importance to avoid all complications of the present
                            struggle which would practically benefit the insurgents, I shall delay
                            to open any sources of controversy which I think may be avoided until
                            especially instructed to do otherwise.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your despatch of August 2 (No. 22) has
                            been received. It is accompanied by a correspondence which has just
                            taken place between yourself and Lord John Russell, with a view, on your
                            part, to remove possible obstructions against the entrance upon
                            negotiations, with which you have so long been charged, for an accession
                            on our part to the declaration of the congress of Paris on the subject
                            of the rights of neutrals in maritime war. It was also understood by you
                            that a further result of the correspondence would be to facilitate,
                            indirectly, the opening of similar negotiations for a like object, by
                            Mr. Dayton, with the government of France.</p>
                        <p>Your letter to Lord John Russell is judicious, and is approved. Lord John
                            Russell’s answer is satisfactory, with the exception of a single
                            passage, upon which it is my duty to instruct you to ask the British
                            secretary for foreign affairs for an explanation.</p>
                        <p>That passage is as follows:</p>
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“I need scarcely add that on the part of Great Britain the engagement
                                will be prospective, and will not invalidate anything already
                                done.”</p>
                        </quote>
                        <p>A brief statement of the objects of the proposed negotiation will bring
                            the necessity for an explanation of this passage into a stong light. We
                            have heretofore proposed to other maritime states certain meliorations
                            of the laws of maritime war affecting the rights of neutrals. These
                            meliorations are: 1st. That the neutral flag shall protect enemy’s goods
                            not contraband of war. 2d. That the goods of neutrals, not contraband,
                            though found <pb n="129" xml:id="pg_129" facs="0129"/> under an enemy’s
                            flag, shall not be confiscated. 3d. That blockades, to be respected,
                            must be effective.</p>
                        <p>The congress at Paris adopted these three principles, adding a fourth,
                            namely, that privateering shall be abolished. The powers which
                            constituted that congress invited the adhesion of the United States to
                            that declaration. The United States answered that they would accede on
                            condition; that the other powers would accept a fifth proposition,
                            namely, that the goods of private persons, non-combatants, should be
                            exempt from confiscation in maritime war.</p>
                        <p>When this answer was given by the United States, the British government
                            declined to accept the proposed amendment, or fifth proposition, thus
                            offered by the United States, and the negotiation was then suspended. We
                            have now proposed to resume the negotiation, offering our adhesion to
                            the declaration of Paris, as before, with the amendment which would
                            exempt private property from confiscation in maritime war.</p>
                        <p>The British government now, as before, declares this amendment or fifth
                            proposition inadmissible. It results that, if the United States can at
                            all become a party to the declaration of the congress of Paris by the
                            necessary consent of the parties already committed to it, this can be
                            done only by their accepting that declaration without any amendment
                            whatever, in other words, “pure and simple.” Under these circumstances
                            you have proposed in your letter to Lord John Russell to negotiate our
                            adhesion to the declaration in that form. It is at this stage of the
                            affair that Lord John Russell interposes, by way of caution, the remark,
                            that “on the part of Great Britain the engagement will be prospective,
                            and will not invalidate anything already done.”</p>
                        <p>I need dwell on this remark only one moment to show that, although
                            expressed in a very simple form and in a quite casual manner, it
                            contains what amounts to a preliminary condition, which must be conceded
                            by the United States to Great Britain, and either be inserted in the
                            convention, and so modify our adhesion to the declaration of Paris, or
                            else must be in some confidential manner implied and reserved, with the
                            same effect.</p>
                        <p>Upon principle this government could not consent to enter into formal
                            negotiations, the result of which, as expressed in a convention, should
                            be modified or restricted by a tacit or implied reservation. Even if
                            such a proceeding was compatible with our convictions of propriety or of
                            expediency, there would yet remain an insuperable obstacle in the way of
                            such a measure.</p>
                        <p>The President can only initiate a treaty. The treaty negotiated can come
                            into life only through an express and deliberate act of ratification by
                            the Senate of the United States, which ratification sanctions, in any
                            case, only what is set down in the treaty itself. I am not, by any
                            means, to be understood in these remarks as implying a belief that Lord
                            John Russell desires, expects, or contemplates the practice of any
                            reservation on the part of the United States or of Great Britain. The
                            fact of his having given you the caution upon which I am remarking,
                            would be sufficient, if evidence were necessary, to exclude any
                            apprehension of that sort. It results from, these remarks that the
                            convention into which we are to enter must contain a provision to the
                            effect that “the engagements” to be made therein are “on the part of
                            Great Britain prospective, and will not invalidate anything already
                            done.”</p>
                        <p>I must, therefore, now discuss the propriety of inserting such a
                            stipulation in the convention which you have been authorized to
                            consummate. The proposed stipulation is divisible into two parts,
                            namely: First. That the engagements of Great Britain are “prospective”
                            [only.]</p>
                        <p>I do not see any great objection to such an amendment. But why should <pb
                                n="130" xml:id="pg_130" facs="0130"/> it be important. A contract is
                            always prospective, and prospective only, if it contains no express
                            stipulation that it shall be retrospective in its operation. So much,
                            therefore, of the stipulation asked is unnecessary, while, if conceded,
                            it might possibly give occasion to misapprehension as to its effect. You
                            will, therefore, decline to make such a condition without first
                            receiving a satisfactory explanation of its meaning and its
                            importance.</p>
                        <p>The second part of the proposed condition is, that the “engagement will
                            not invalidate anything already done.” I am not sure that I should think
                            this proposed condition exceptionable, if its effect were clearly
                            understood. It is necessary, however, to go outside of his lordship’s
                            letter to find out what is meant by the words “anything already done.”
                            If “anything” pertinent to the subject “has been already done” which
                            ought not to be invalidated, it is clear that it must have been done
                            either by the joint action of the United States and Great Britain, or by
                            the United States only, or by Great Britain acting alone. There has been
                            no joint action of the United States and Great Britain upon the subject.
                            The United States have done nothing affecting it; certainly nothing
                            which they apprehend would be invalidated by the simple form of
                            convention which they propose. I am left to conclude, therefore that the
                            “thing” which “has been done already,” and which Great Britain desires
                            shall not be invalidated by the convention, must be something which she
                            herself has done. At the same time we are left to conjecture what that
                            thing is which is thus to be carefully saved. It would be hazardous on
                            our part to assume to know, while I have no doubt that the British
                            government, with its accustomed frankness, and in view of the
                            desirableness of a perfect understanding of the matter, will at once
                            specify what the thing which has been done by her, and which is not to
                            be invalidated, really is. You will, therefore, respectfully ask the
                            right honorable secretary for foreign affairs for an explanation of the
                            part of his letter which I have thus drawn under review, as a
                            preliminary to any further proceedings in the proposed negotiation.</p>
                        <p>You will perform this in such a manner as to show that the explanation is
                            asked in no querulous or hypercritical spirit. Secondly, you will
                            perform it with reasonable promptness, so that the attainment of the
                            important object of the negotiation may not be unnecessarily delayed;
                            and, thirdly, you will assure the British government that while the
                            United States at present see no reason to think that the stipulation
                            proposed is necessary or expedient, yet, in view of the great interests
                            of commerce and of civilization which are involved, they will refuse
                            nothing which shall be really just or even nonessential and not
                            injurious to themselves, while of course I suppose they are not expected
                            in any way to compromise their own national integrity, safety, or
                            honor.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Alexander H. Schultz, a special messenger,
                            will deliver to you this despatch, together with a bag containing papers
                            addressed to Lord John Russell.</p>
                        <pb n="131" xml:id="pg_131" facs="0131"/>
                        <p>On the 5th instant I was advised by a telegram from Cincinnati that
                            Robert Mure, of Charleston, was on his way to New York to embark at that
                            port for England, and that he was a bearer of despatches from the
                            usurping insurrectionary authorities of Richmond to Earl Russell. Other
                            information bore that he was a bearer of despatches from the same
                            authorities to their agents in London. Information from various sources
                            agreed in the fact that he was travelling under a passport from the
                            British consul at Charleston.</p>
                        <p>Upon this information I directed the police at New York to detain Mr.
                            Mure and any papers which might be found in his possession until I
                            should give further directions. He was so detained, and he is now in
                            custody at Fort Lafayette, awaiting full disclosures. In his possession
                            were found seventy letters, four of which were unsealed and sixty-six
                            sealed. There was also found in his possession a sealed bag marked
                            “Foreign Office, 3,” with two labels, as follows: “On Her Brit. Maj.
                            service. The Right Honorable the Lord John Russell, M. P., &amp;c.,
                            &amp;c., &amp;c. Despatches in charge of Robert Mure, Esq,” signed
                            Robert Bunch. “On Her Brit. Maj. service. The Right Honorable the Lord
                            John Russell, M. P., H. B. M.’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign
                            Affairs, Foreign Office, London, R. Bunch.” The bag bears two
                            impressions of the seal of office of the British consul at Charleston,
                            and seems to contain voluminous papers.</p>
                        <p>There were also found upon Mr. Mure’s person, in an open envelope, what
                            pretends to be a passport in the following words.—(See Annex A.)</p>
                        <p>Also a letter of introduction, which is as follows.—(See Annex B.)</p>
                        <p>There were also found several unsealed copies of a printed pamphlet
                            entitled “A narrative of the Battles of Bull Run and Manassas Junction,
                            July 18th and 21st. Accounts of the advance of both armies, the battles
                            and rout of the enemy, compiled chiefly from the detailed reports of the
                            Virginia and South Carolina press; Charleston, Steam Power Presses of
                            Evans &amp; Coggswell, No. 3 Broad, and 103 East Bay streets, 1861.”</p>
                        <p>This pamphlet is manifestly an argument for the disunion of the United
                            States. Several copies of it were found addressed to persons in
                            England.</p>
                        <p>The marks and outward appearance of the bag indicate that its contents
                            are exclusively legitimate communications from the British consul at
                            Charleston to H. B. M.’s government. Nevertheless, I have what seem to
                            be good reasons for supposing that they may be treasonable papers,
                            designed and gotten up to aid parties engaged in arms for the overthrow
                            of this government and the dissolution of the Union. These reasons are:
                            1st. That I can hardly conceive that there can be any occasion for such
                            very voluminous communications of a legitimate nature being made by the
                            consul at Charleston to his government at the present time. 2d. Consuls
                            have no authority to issue passports, the granting of them being, as I
                            understand, not a consular but a diplomatic function. Passports,
                            however, have, in other times, been habitually granted by foreign
                            consuls residing in the United States. But soon after the insurrection
                            broke out in the Southern States a regulation was made by this
                            department, which I have excellent means of knowing was communicated to
                            the British consul at Charleston, to the effect that, until further
                            orders, no diplomatic or consular passports would be recognized by this
                            government, so far as to permit the bearer to pass through the lines of
                            the national forces or out of the country unless it should be
                            countersigned by the Secretary of State and the commanding general of
                            the army of the United States. Mr. Mure had passed the lines of the
                            army, and was in the act of leaving the United States in open violation
                            of this regulation. Moreover, the bearer of the papers, Robert Mure, is
                            a naturalized citizen of the United States, has resided here thirty
                            years, and is a colonel in the insurgent military forces of South
                            Carolina. <pb n="132" xml:id="pg_132" facs="0132"/> 3d. If the papers
                            contained in the bag are not illegal in their nature or purpose, it is
                            not seen why their safe transmission was not secured, as it might have
                            been by exposing them in some way to Lord Lyons, British minister
                            residing at this capital, whose voucher for their propriety, as Mr.
                            Bunch must well know, would exempt them from all scrutiny or suspicion.
                            4th. The consul’s letter to the bearer of dispatches attaches an unusual
                            importance to the papers in question, while it expresses great
                            impatience for their immediate conveyance to their destination, and an
                            undue anxiety lest they might, by some accident, come under the notice
                            of this government. 5th. The bearer is proved to be disloyal to the
                            United States by the pamphlet and the letters found in his
                            possession.</p>
                        <p>I have examined many of the papers found upon the person of Mr. Mure, and
                            I find them full of treasonable information, and clearly written for
                            treasonable purposes. These, I think, will be deemed sufficient grounds
                            for desiring the scrutiny of the papers and surveillance of the bearer
                            on my part.</p>
                        <p>Comity towards the British government, together with a perfect confidence
                            in its justice and honor, as well as its friendship towards the United
                            States, to say nothing of a sense of propriety, which I could not
                            dismiss, have prevented me from entertaining, for a moment, the idea of
                            breaking the seals which I have so much reason to believe were put upon
                            the consular bag to save it from my inspection, while the bearer himself
                            might remove them on his arrival in London, after which he might convey
                            the papers, if treasonable, to the agents of the insurgents, now
                            understood to be residing in several of the capitals in Europe.</p>
                        <p>I will not say that I have established the fact that the papers in
                            question are treasonable in their nature, and are made with purposes
                            hostile and dangerous to this country. But I confess I fear they are so,
                            and I apprehend either that they are guilty despatches to the agents of
                            disunion, or else that, if they are really addressed to the British
                            government, they are papers prepared by traitors in the insurrectionary
                            States, with a view to apply to the British government for some
                            advantage and assistance or countenance from that government injurious
                            to the United States and subversive of their sovereignty. Of course, I
                            need hardly say that I disclaim any thought that Earl Russell has any
                            knowledge of the papers or of their being sent, or that I have any
                            belief or fear that the British government would, in any way, receive
                            the papers if they are illegal in their character, or dangerous or
                            injurious to the United States. It is important, however, to this
                            government that whatever mischief, if any, may be lurking in the
                            transaction, be counteracted and prevented.</p>
                        <p>I have, therefore, upon due consideration of the case, concluded to send
                            the bag by a special messenger, who will deliver it into your care, and
                            to instruct you to see that it is delivered accordingly to its address
                            in exactly the condition in which you receive it.</p>
                        <p>You will also make known to the Earl Russell the causes and the
                            circumstances of the arrest and detention of Mr. Mure and his papers,
                            adding the assurance that this government deeply regrets that it has
                            become necessary; and that it will be very desirous to excuse the brief
                            interruption of the correspondence of the British consul, if it is
                            indeed innocent, and will endeavor, in that case, to render any further
                            satisfaction which may be justly required. On the other hand, you will,
                            in such terms as you shall find most suitable and proper, intimate that
                            if the papers in question shall prove to be treasonable against the
                            United States, I expect that they will be delivered up to you for the
                            use of this government, and that her British Majesty’s consul at
                            Charleston will, in that case, be promptly made to feel the severe
                            displeasure of the <pb n="133" xml:id="pg_133" facs="0133"/> government
                            which employs him, since there can be no greater crime against society
                            than a perversion by the agent of one government of the hospitality
                            afforded to him by another, to designs against its safety, dignity, and
                            honor.</p>
                        <p>I think it proper to say that I have apprised Lord Lyons of this
                            transaction, and of the general character of this letter, while he is
                            not in any way compromised by any assent given to my proceedings, or by
                            any opinion expressed by him or asked from him.</p>

                            United States. The following is an extract from one of them:</p>
                        <p>“Mr. B., on oath of secrecy, communicated to me also that the <hi
                                rend="italic">first step</hi> to recognition was taken. He and Mr.
                            Belligny together sent Mr. Trescot to Richmond yesterday, to ask Jeff.
                            Davis, president, to —— the treaty of —— to —— the neutral flag covering
                            neutral goods to be respected. This is the first step of direct treating
                            with our government, so prepare for active business by January 1.”</p>
                        <p>You will submit this information to the British government, and request
                            that Mr. Bunch may be removed from his office, saying that this
                            government will grant an exequatur to any person who may be appointed to
                            fill it, who will not pervert his functions to hostilities against the
                            United States.</p>
                        <p>I am, sir, respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

                            declaration which he proposes to make upon signing the convention,
                            embodying the articles of the declaration of Paris, in conjunction with
                            myself.</p>
                        <p>I have waited to communicate with Mr. Dayton until I now learn from him
                            that Mr. Thouvenel proposes to him a similar movement on the part of
                            France.</p>
                        <p>This proceeding is of so grave and novel a character as, in my opinion,
                            to render further action unadvisable until I obtain further
                            instructions; and I find Mr. Dayton is of the same opinion on his side.

                            been received.</p>
                        <p>The account you have given us of the impression made by the reverse of
                            our arms at Manassas does not surprise me. But there are to be very many
                            fluctuations of opinion in Europe concerning our affairs before the
                            Union will be in danger from any source.</p>
                        <pb n="135" xml:id="pg_135" facs="0135"/>
                        <p>The Insurgents are exhausting themselves. We are invigorated even by
                            disappointment. To-day the capital is beyond danger, and forces are
                            accumulating and taking on the qualities which will render them
                            invincible. The Union armies are preparing for movements which will, in
                            a few weeks, remove the war from the present frontier. The blockade is
                            effective, and is working out the best fruits.</p>
                        <p>We do not at present depart from that policy, but we are preparing for
                            any emergency in our foreign relations.</p>
                        <p>The sentiment of disunion is losing its expansive force, and every day it
                            grows weaker as a physical power.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: It is not without regret that I am
                            compelled to announce the failure of the negotiation which I am led, by
                            the tenor of your despatches, Nos. 55 and 58, to infer you considered
                            almost sure to succeed. I have now the honor to transmit the copy of a
                            note addressed by me to Lord Russell on the the 23d instant, assigning
                            the reasons why I felt it my duty to take the responsibility of
                            declining to fix a day for signing the convention agreed upon between
                            us, burdened, as it was to be, with a contemporaneous exposition of one
                            of its provisions in the form of an outside declaration made by his
                            lordship on behalf of her Majesty the Queen. I have gone so fully into
                            the matter in that note as to render further explanation unnecessary. At
                            the same time I take the liberty to observe that, in case the President
                            should be of opinion that too much stress has been laid by me upon the
                            objectionable character of that paper, an opening has been left by me
                            for the resumption of the negotiation at any moment under new
                            instructions modifying my views. I transmitted to Mr. Dayton a copy for
                            his information immediately after the original was sent. I have not
                            received any later intelligence from him; but I do not doubt that he
                            will forward to the department by this mail his representation of the
                            state of the corresponding negotiation at Paris, so that the whole
                            subject will be under your eye at the same moment. From the tenor of his
                            last note to me, I was led to infer that M. Thouvenel contemplated a
                            parallel proceeding in the conclusion of his negotiation, and that he
                            regarded it there very much in the same light that I did here.</p>
                        <p>From a review of the whole course of these proceedings I am led to infer
                            the existence of some influence in the cabinet here adverse to the
                            success of this negotiation. At the time of my last conference with Lord
                            Russell I had every reason, from his manner, to believe that he
                            considered the offer of the project as perfectly satisfactory. The
                            suggestion of a qualification did not make its appearance until after
                            the consultation with his colleagues, when it showed itself first in the
                            enigmatical sentence of his note to me of the 31st of July, of which, in
                            my despatch No. 22 to the department, I confessed my inability to
                            comprehend the meaning, and afterwards in the formal announcement
                            contained in his note of the 19th of August. That the failure of the
                            measure, by reason of it, could not have been altogether unexpected I
                                <pb n="136" xml:id="pg_136" facs="0136"/> infer from Mr. Dayton’s
                            report to me of M. Thouvenel’s language to him, to the effect that his
                            government would prefer to lose the negotiation rather than to omit
                            making the exception.</p>
                        <p>Although the matter is not altogether germane to the preceding, I will
                            not close this despatch without calling your attention, to the copy of a
                            letter of Lord John Russell to Mr. Edwardes, which I transmit as cut
                            from a London newspaper, The Globe. It purports to have been taken from
                            parliamentary papers just published, although I have not seen them, nor
                            have I found it printed in any other newspaper. You will notice the
                            date, the 14th of May, being the very day of my first, visit to his
                            lordship in company with Mr. Dallas, when he did not see us, as well as
                            of the publication of the Queen’s proclamation. I have reason to believe
                            that the original form of that proclamation described the parties in
                            America in much the same terms used by his Lordship, and that they were
                            only qualified at a very late moment, and after earnest remonstrance.
                            The tone of the letter corresponds very much with that used to me, a
                            report of which was transmitted in my despatch No. 8.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant,</p>

                            <p>The undersigned, envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of
                                the United States, has the honor to acknowledge the reception of the
                                note of the 19th instant, of Lord Russell, her Majesty’s principal
                                secretary of state for foreign affairs, covering the copy of a
                                declaration which his lordship proposes to make upon signing the
                                convention which has been agreed upon between her Majesty the Queen
                                of Great Britain and Ireland, and the United States of America,
                                embodying the articles of the declaration of Paris, and at the same
                                time requesting him to name a day in the course of this week for the
                                signature of the convention, in conjunction with a similar
                                proceeding, to be arranged to take place at Paris, between Mr.
                                Dayton and the minister of foreign affairs on the part of the French
                                government.</p>
                            <p>The first step rendered necessary by this proposal was that the
                                undersigned should communicate with Mr. Dayton in order to know
                                whether a similar declaration was contemplated on the part of the
                                Emperor of the French, and in case it was, whether Mr. Dayton was
                                still prepared to proceed. Mr. Dayton’s letter containing that
                                information was received only yesterday, which fact, in conjunction
                                with a brief absence of the undersigned, will account for the
                                apparent delay in answering his lordship’s note.</p>
                            <p>In order perfectly to understand the position of the undersigned, it
                                will be necessary briefly to recapitulate the particulars of this
                                negotiation. But a few weeks after the accession of the President of
                                the United States to office, his attention was turned to the state
                                in which the negotiation on the subject of the four articles of the
                                declaration of Paris had been left by his predecessor; and his
                                disposition manifested itself to remove so far as he could the
                                obstacles which had been interposed in the way of completing it. To
                                that end, among the duties with which the undersigned was charged
                                immediately upon his arrival at his post, was an instruction at once
                                to make overtures to her Majesty’s government for a revival of the
                                negotiation here. And, in case of the manifestation of a favorable
                                disposition, he was further directed to <pb n="137" xml:id="pg_137"
                                    facs="0137"/> offer a project of a convention, which he was
                                properly empowered to sign, after satisfying himself that the
                                incorporation of the amendment which had been proposed by Mr. Marcy
                                for the government of the United States, at a former stage of the
                                proceedings, was not attainable.</p>
                            <p>On the eighteenth of May last, being the day of the first interview
                                had with his lordship, the subject was only opened by the
                                undersigned as one on which he had power to negotiate, and the
                                disposition of her Majesty’s government to proceed here was tested.
                                It was then that he received a distinct impression from his lordship
                                that the matter had been already committed to the care of Lord Lyons
                                at Washington, with authority to agree with the government of the
                                United States on the basis of the adoption of three of the articles,
                                and the omission of the fourth altogether. Considering this to be
                                equivalent to declining a negotiation here, and at the same time
                                relieving him from a duty which would be better performed by his own
                                government, the undersigned cheerfully acquiesced in this
                                suggestion, and accordingly wrote home signifying his intention not
                                to renew the subject unless again specifically instructed so to
                                do.</p>
                            <p>One month passed away, when the Secretary of State of the United
                                States, after a conference with Lord Lyons, learning that his
                                lordship did not confirm the representation of the powers with which
                                the undersigned had understood him to be clothed, and, so far from
                                it, that he did not feel authorized to enter into any convention at
                                all at Washington, directed the undersigned to inform the government
                                in London of this fact, and to propose once more to enter into
                                convention, if agreeable, here.</p>
                            <p>Immediately upon the receipt of these instructions, the undersigned
                                wrote a letter on the 11th of July, as his lordship may remember,
                                reciting these facts and renewing the question whether a proposal of
                                negotiation at this place would be acceptable to her Majesty’s
                                government. To this letter a favorable reply was received on the
                                13th, and an interview took place the same day, at which, after
                                ascertaining that the amendment desired by his government would not
                                be successful, the undersigned had the honor to present to his
                                lordship the project in the same form in which it had been, nearly
                                two months before, placed in his hands, and in which it has been
                                since accepted, and to offer a copy of his powers to negotiate. His
                                lordship, after examining the former, remarked that he would take it
                                for consultation with his colleagues, and in the meantime that there
                                was no necessity for a copy of the powers.</p>
                            <p>The next step in the negotiation was the receipt, by the undersigned,
                                of a letter from his lordship, dated the 18th of July, calling his
                                attention to the fact that the declaration of Paris contemplated a
                                concurrence of various powers, and not an insulated engagement of
                                two powers only, and requiring an assurance that the United States
                                were ready to enter into a similar engagement with France and with
                                other maritime powers, parties to the declaration, and not with
                                Great Britain alone. But, inasmuch as this process itself might
                                involve the loss of much time, that her Majesty’s government would
                                deem themselves authorized to advise the Queen to conclude a
                                convention with the President of the United States so soon as they
                                should have been informed that a similar convention has been agreed
                                upon between the President and the Emperor of the French.</p>
                            <p>Upon receiving this reply the undersigned, not unwilling to do
                                everything within his power to forward an object considered by him
                                of the greatest value, immediately opened a correspondence with Mr.
                                Dayton, the representative of the United States at Paris, to learn
                                from him whether such an arrangement as that contemplated in his
                                lordship’s note could not be at once carried out by him. With some
                                reluctance Mr. Dayton consented to promote it, but only upon the
                                production of evidence satisfactory to his own mind <pb n="138"
                                    xml:id="pg_138" facs="0138"/> that the amendment originally
                                proposed by Mr. Marcy was not attainable. The undersigned then
                                addressed himself to his lordship, and with entire success. The
                                evidence was obtained, Mr. Dayton acted with success, and no further
                                difficulties then seemed to be in the way of a speedy and
                                simultaneous affirmation of concurrence in the principles of the
                                declaration of Paris by the United States, in conjunction with the
                                other powers.</p>
                            <p>The public law thus declared to be established, embraced four general
                                propositions, to wit: <list>

                            <p>The government of the United States, in proposing to join in the
                                establishment of these principles, are believed by the undersigned
                                to be acting with the single purpose of aiding to establish a
                                permanent doctrine for all time. Convinced of the value of it in
                                ameliorating the horrors of warfare all over the globe, they have,
                                perhaps against their notions of their immediate interest, consented
                                to waive temporary considerations of expediency for the attainment
                                of a great ultimate good. They are at last prepared to sign and seal
                                an engagement pure and simple, and by so doing to sacrifice the hope
                                of attaining, at least for the present, an improvement of it to
                                which they have always attached great value. But just at the moment
                                when their concurrence with the views of the other maritime powers
                                of the world would seem to be certain, they are met with a
                                proposition from one, if not more, of the parties, to accompany the
                                act with a proceeding somewhat novel and anomalous in this case,
                                being the presentation of a written declaration, not making a part
                                of the convention itself, but intended to follow the signature, to
                                the effect that “her Majesty does not intend thereby to undertake
                                any engagement which shall have any bearing, direct <hi
                                    rend="italic">or indirect</hi>, on the internal differences now
                                prevailing in the United States.”</p>
                            <p>Obviously a consent to accept a particular exception, susceptible of
                                so wide a construction of a joint instrument, made by one of the
                                parties to it in its own favor at the time of signing, would justify
                                the idea that some advantage is, or may be suspected to be, intended
                                to be taken by the other. The natural effect of such an
                                accompaniment would seem to be to imply that the goverment of the
                                United States might be desirous, at this time, to take a part in the
                                declaration, not from any high purpose or durable policy, but with
                                the view of securing some small temporary object in the unhappy
                                struggle which is going on at home. Such an inference would spoil
                                all the value that might be attached to the act itself. The mere
                                toleration of it would seem to be equivalent to a confession of
                                their own weakness. Rather than that such a record should be made,
                                it were a thousand times better that the declaration remain unsigned
                                forever. If the parties to the instrument are not to sign it upon
                                terms of perfect reciprocity, with all their duties and obligations
                                under it perfectly equal, and without equivocation or reservation of
                                any kind, on any side, then is it plain that the proper season for
                                such an engagement has not yet arrived. It were much wiser to put it
                                off until nations can understand each other better.</p>
                            <p>There is another reason why the undersigned cannot at this moment
                                consent to proceed under the powers conferred on him to complete
                                this negotiation when clogged with such a declaration, which is
                                drawn from the peculiar construction of the government of his own
                                country. By the terms of the Constitution, every treaty negotiated
                                by the President of the United States must, before it is ratified,
                                be submitted to the consideration of the Senate of the United
                                States. The question immediately arises in this case, what is to be
                                done with a declaration like that which his lordship proposes to
                                make. <pb n="139" xml:id="pg_139" facs="0139"/> Is it a part of the
                                treaty, or is it not? If it be, then is the undersigned exceeding
                                his instructions in signing it, for the paper made no part of the
                                project which he was directed to propose; and in case he should
                                sign, the addition must be submitted to the Senate for its advice
                                and consent, together with the paper itself. If it be not, what
                                advantage can the party making the declaration expect from it in
                                modifying the construction of the project, when the Senate have
                                never had it before them for their approval? It either changes the
                                treaty or it does not. If it does, then the question arises, why did
                                not the undersigned procure it to be incorporated into it? On the
                                other hand, if it do not, why did he connive at the appearance of a
                                desire to do it without effecting the object?</p>
                            <p>The undersigned has ever been desirous of maintaining and
                                perpetuating the most friendly relations between her Majesty’s
                                kingdom and the United States, and he continues to act in the same
                                spirit when he deprecates the submission of any project clogged with
                                a similar exception to the consideration of the Senate of the United
                                States. He has reason to believe that already a strong
                                disinclination exists in that body to the acceptance of the first of
                                the four propositions embraced in the declaration itself, and that
                                mainly because it is esteemed to be too much of a concession to the
                                great maritime powers. Were he now to consent, without further
                                instructions, to accept a qualification which would scarcely fail to
                                be regarded by many unfavorably disposed persons as more or less
                                directly an insult to the nation in its present distress, he should
                                deem himself as incurring the hazard of bringing on difficulties
                                which he professes an earnest wish to avoid.</p>
                            <p>For the reasons thus given the undersigned has reluctantly come to
                                the conclusion to decline to fix a day for proceeding in the
                                negotiation under its present aspect, at least until he shall have
                                been able to submit the whole question once more to the judgment of
                                the authorities under which he has the honor to act.</p>
                            <p>A copy of this letter will also be forwarded to Mr. Dayton for his
                                information.</p>
                            <p>The undersigned prays Lord Russell to receive the assurances of the
                                most distinguished consideration with which he is his obedient
                                servant.</p>

                            <p>It is for the Spanish government to weigh in the balance of their
                                judgment the advantages and inconveniences which may arise from the
                                annexation of the territory of the Dominican state to the dominions
                                of Spain; and any opinion which her Majesty’s government may form on
                                the subject can be founded on no other consideration than a regard
                                for what they may look upon as the real and permanent interests of
                                Spain.</p>
                            <p>Her Majesty’s government would, no doubt, have felt a strong and
                                decided dissatisfaction at the proposed annexation if it had been
                                likely to lead to the introduction of slavery into a community which
                                is free from the taint of that pernicious institution; but the
                                formal and repeated declarations of Marshal O’Donnell, that under no
                                circumstances will slavery be introduced into the Dominican
                                territory, have removed the main cause which would have led her <pb
                                    n="140" xml:id="pg_140" facs="0140"/> Majesty’s government to
                                view the proposed annexation with dislike and repugnance.</p>
                            <p>Her Majesty’s government certainly apprehended, when first this
                                projected annexation was talked of, that it might, if carried into
                                execution, involve Spain in unfriendly discussions, if not in
                                conflict, either with France or with the United States, or with
                                both. With regard to France, her Majesty’s government have not
                                learned that the French government has expressed any positive
                                objection to the proposed arrangement, although she may not think it
                                advantageous to Spain. It appears, also, from what has been stated
                                to you, that there is no probability at present of any positive
                                resistance to the measure, either by the northern or the southern
                                confederation of North America. But the Spanish government should
                                not too confidently rely on the permanent continuance of this
                                indifference or acquiescence on the part of the North Americans; and
                                it is not impossible that when the civil war which is now breaking
                                out shall have been brought to an end, an event which may happen
                                sooner than at present appears likely, both the north and the south
                                might combine to make the occupation of the Dominican territory by
                                Spain the cause of serious difference between the North American
                                governments and that of Spain.</p>
                            <p>Her Majesty’s government do not deny that Great Britain, as a power
                                naturally inclined to peace, and systematically addicted to
                                commerce, must always view a war between any two powers as an event
                                not only at variance with her principles, but to a certain degree
                                injurious to her interests. But with respect to Spain, the motives
                                of the British government spring from far higher sources. Great
                                Britain and Spain have for long periods of time, and in
                                circumstances of high moment to each, been faithful and active
                                allies; their alliance has been greatly useful and eminently
                                honorable to both. It is a fundamental maxim of British policy to
                                wish well to Spain, and earnestly to desire her welfare and
                                prosperity; and therefore any combination of events which might at
                                any time involve the possibility of Spain being engaged in a
                                conflict which, from local circumstances and disadvantages, might be
                                in the end seriously injurious to her rule over her ancient
                                possessions, would be viewed by her Majesty’s government with lively
                                apprehension and sincere regret.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your despatch of the 16th of August,
                            number 29, has been received.</p>
                        <p rend="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
                        <p>Steadily for the period of four months our forces have been coming into
                            the field at the rate of two thousand a day, and the same augmentation
                            will go on nearly at the same rate until 500,000 men will be found in
                            the service. Our supplies of arms are running low.</p>
                        <p>My despatch, No. 42, acknowledged by you in the paper before me, was
                            written, as you will see by its date, July 21, during the progress of
                            the battle at Bull Run, though sent a few days afterwards. From this
                            fact you will see that our policy and our claims upon the government of
                            Great Britain are not affected by the caprices of military fortune.</p>
                        <p>We have now reached a new and important stage in the war. The enemy <pb
                                n="141" xml:id="pg_141" facs="0141"/> is directly before us,
                            invigorated and inspirited by a victory, which it is not the part of
                            wisdom for us to undervalue. But that victory has brought with it the
                            necessity for renewed and decisive action with proportionate results.
                            The demoralization of our forces has passed away. I have already stated
                            that they are increasing in numbers. You will learn through other
                            channels that they are equally perfecting themselves in discipline.
                            Commander Stringham and General Butler’s success at Hatteras was not
                            merely a brilliant affair. It brings nearly the whole coast of North
                            Carolina under the surveillance of our blockade. * * * * * * *</p>
                        <p>I shall be entirely satisfied with the exercise of your own discretion as
                            to the time and form you may choose for making the explanations to the
                            British government on those subjects with which you are charged, and I
                            regard the condition of things in that respect, as you have reported it
                            to me, as, under the circumstances, quite satisfactory. No change of
                            policy in regard to the blockade has been adopted since my former
                            despatches.</p>
                        <p>I can well enough imagine that your position has been made a trying one
                            by the exultations of enemies of our country and its institutions over
                            the disaster of the 21st of July. But you will be able to comprehend
                            what they cannot, that faction ripens fast, whence its necessities impel
                            to action which exhausts its energies. Loyalty in any free country
                            organizes less rapidly and gains strength from time and even from
                            reverses. The previous success of this government is a sufficient
                            guaranty of the safety of our cause, and is a fact too important to be
                            misunderstood in the political circle in which you are moving.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have received your despatch of August
                            23, number 32. It is accompanied by a note which was addressed to you by
                            Lord Russell on the 19th of the same month, and a paper containing the
                            form of an official declaration which he proposes to make on the part of
                            her Majesty on the occasion of affixing his signature to the projected
                            convention between the United States and Great Britain for the accession
                            of the former power to the articles of the declaration of the congress
                            of Paris for the melioration of the rigor of international law in regard
                            to neutrals in maritime war. The instrument thus submitted to us by Lord
                            Russell is in the following words: “Draft of declaration.—In affixing
                            his signature to the convention of this day, between her Majesty the
                            Queen of Great Britain and Ireland and the United States of America, the
                            Earl Russell declares, by order of her Majesty, that her Majesty does
                            not intend thereby to undertake any engagement which shall have any
                            bearing, direct or indirect, on the internal differences now prevailing
                            in the United States.”</p>
                        <p>Lord Russell, in his note to you, explains the object of the instrument
                            by saying that it is intended to prevent any misconception as to the
                            nature of the engagement to be taken by her Majesty.</p>
                        <p>You have judged very rightly in considering this proceeding, on the part
                            of the British government, as one so grave and so novel in its character
                            as to render further action on your part in regard to the projected
                            convention inadmissible until you shall have special instructions from
                            this department.</p>
                        <pb n="142" xml:id="pg_142" facs="0142"/>
                        <p>Long before the present communication can reach you, my instructions of
                            August 17, No. 61, will have come to your hands. That paper directed you
                            to ask Lord Russell to explain a passage in a note written to you, and
                            then lying before me, in which he said: “I need scarcely add that on the
                            part of Great Britain the engagement (to be contained in the projected
                            convention) will be prospective, and will not invalidate anything
                            already done;” which explanation I stated would be expected as a
                            preliminary before you could proceed further in the transaction.</p>
                        <p>You have thus been already prepared for the information that your
                            resolution to await special instructions in the present emergency is
                            approved.</p>
                        <p>I feel myself at liberty, perhaps bound, to assume that Lord Russell’s
                            proposed declaration, which I have herein recited, will have been
                            already regarded, as well by him as by yourself, as sufficiently
                            answering the request for preliminary explanations which you were
                            instructed to make.</p>
                        <p>I may, therefore, assume that the case is fully before me, and that the
                            question whether this government will consent to enter into the
                            projected treaty with Great Britain, subject to the condition of
                            admitting the simultaneous declaration on her Majesty’s part, proposed
                            by Lord Russell, is ready to be decided.</p>
                        <p>I am instructed by the President to say that the proposed declaration is
                            inadmissible.</p>
                        <p>It would be virtually a new and distinct article incorporated into the
                            projected convention. To admit such a new article would, for the first
                            time in the history of the United States, be to permit a foreign power
                            to take cognizance of and adjust its relations upon assumed internal and
                            purely domestic differences existing within our own country.</p>
                        <p>This broad consideration supersedes any necessity for considering in what
                            manner or in what degree the projected convention, if completed either
                            subject to the explanation proposed or not, would bear directly or
                            indirectly on the internal differences which the British government
                            assume to be prevailing in the United States.</p>
                        <p>I do not enlarge upon this branch of the subject. It is enough to say
                            that the view thus adopted by the President seems to be in harmony
                            equally with a prudent regard to the safety of the republic and a just
                            sense of its honor and dignity.</p>
                        <p>The proposed declaration is inadmissible, among other reasons, because it
                            is not mutual. It proposes a special rule by which her Majesty’s
                            obligations shall be meliorated in their bearing upon internal
                            difficulties now prevailing in the United States, while the obligations
                            to be assumed by the United States shall not be similarly meliorated or
                            at all affected in their bearing on internal differences that may now be
                            prevailing, or may hereafter arise and prevail, in Great Britain.</p>
                        <p>It is inadmissible, because it would be a substantial and even a radical
                            departure from the declaration of the congress at Paris. That
                            declaration makes no exception in favor of any of the parties to it in
                            regard to the bearing of their obligations upon internal differences
                            which may prevail in the territories or dominions of other parties.</p>
                        <p>The declaration of the congress of Paris is the joint act of forty-six
                            great and enlightened powers, designing to alleviate the evils of
                            maritime war, and promote the first interest of humanity, which is
                            peace. The government of Great Britain will not, I am sure, expect us to
                            accede to this noble act otherwise than upon the same equal footing upon
                            which all the other parties to it are standing. We could not consent to
                            accede to the declaration with a modification of its terms unless all
                            the present parties to it should stipulate that the modification should
                            be adopted as one of universal application. The British government
                            cannot but know that there would be little prospect <pb n="143"
                                xml:id="pg_143" facs="0143"/> of an entire reformation of the
                            declaration of Paris at the present time, and it has not even told us
                            that it would accept the modification as a general one if it were
                            proposed.</p>
                        <p>It results that the United States must accede to the declaration of the
                            congress of Paris on the same terms with all the other parties to it, or
                            that they do not accede to it at all.</p>
                        <p>You will present these considerations to Lord Russell, not as arguments
                            why the British government ought to recede from the position it has
                            assumed, but as the grounds upon which the United States decline to
                            enter into the projected convention recognizing that exceptional
                            position of her Majesty.</p>
                        <p>If, therefore, her Britannic Majesty’s government shall adhere to the
                            proposition thus disallowed, you will inform Lord Russell that the
                            negotiation must for the present be suspended.</p>
                        <p>I forbear purposely from a review of the past correspondence, to
                            ascertain the relative responsibilities of the parties for this failure
                            of negotiations, from which I had hoped results would flow beneficial,
                            not only to the two nations, but to the whole world—beneficial, not in
                            the present age only, but in future ages.</p>
                        <p>It is my desire that we may withdraw from the subject carrying away no
                            feelings of passion, prejudice, or jealousy, so that in some happier
                            time it may be resumed, and the important objects of the proposed
                            convention may be fully secured. I believe that that propitious time is
                            even now not distant; and I will hope that when it comes Great Britain
                            will not only willingly and unconditionally accept the adhesion of the
                            United States to all the benignant articles of the declaration of the
                            congress of Paris, but will even go, further, and, relinquishing her
                            present objections, consent, as the United States have so constantly
                            invited, that the private property, not contraband, of citizens and
                            subjects of nations in collision shall be exempted from confiscation
                            equally in warfare waged on the land and in warfare waged upon the seas,
                            which are the common highways of all nations.</p>
                        <p>Regarding this negotiation as at an end, the question arises, what, then,
                            are to be the views and policy of the United States in regard to the
                            rights of neutrals in maritime war in the present case. My previous
                            despatches leave no uncertainty upon this point. We regard Great Britain
                            as a friend. Her Majesty’s flag, according to our traditional
                            principles, covers enemy’s goods not contraband of war. Goods of her
                            Majesty’s subjects, not contraband of war, are exempt from confiscation
                            though found under a neutral or disloyal flag. No depredations shall be
                            committed by our naval forces or by those of any of our citizens, so far
                            as we can prevent it, upon the vessels or property of British subjects.
                            Our blockade, being effective, must be respected.</p>
                        <p>The unfortunate failure of our negotiations to amend the law of nations
                            in regard to maritime war does not make us enemies, although, if they
                            had been successful, we should have perhaps been more assured
                            friends.</p>
                        <p>Civil war is a calamity from which certainly no people or nation that has
                            ever existed has been always exempt. It is one which probably no nation
                            ever will escape. Perhaps its most injurious trait is its tendency to
                            subvert the good understanding and break up the relations existing
                            between the distracted state and friendly nations, and to involve them,
                            sooner or later, in war. It is the desire of the United States that the
                            internal differences existing in this country may be confined within our
                            own borders. I do not suffer myself for a moment to doubt that Great
                            Britain has a desire that we may be successful in attaining that object,
                            and that she looks with dread upon the possibility of being herself
                            drawn into this unhappy internal controversy of our own. I do not think
                            it can be regarded as disrespectful if you should remind Lord Russell
                            that when, in 1838, a civil war broke out in <pb n="144" xml:id="pg_144"
                                facs="0144"/> Canada, a part of the British dominions adjacent to
                            the United States, the Congress of the United States passed and the
                            President executed a law which effectually prevented any intervention
                            against the government of Great Britain in those internal differences by
                            American citizens, whatever might be their motives, real or pretended,
                            whether of interest or sympathy. I send you a copy of that enactment.
                            The British government will judge for itself whether it is suggestive of
                            any measures on the part of Great Britain that might tend to preserve
                            the peace of the two countries, and, through that way, the peace of all
                            nations.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            reception of despatches from the department, numbered from 61 to 67,
                            both inclusive.</p>
                        <p>Since the date of your No. 61, of the 17th of August, you will have
                            learned ere this that the enigmatical extract from Lord Russell’s note
                            to me, of which you instructed me to ask an explanation, has taken a
                            very distinct and unequivocal shape, superseding all necessity for
                            further inquiry. I may take occasion to remark upon the similarity of
                            some of the reasoning in your despatch with that which you will find
                            already made use of in my letter to his lordship, of the 23d August,
                            declining to conclude the negotiation. On the whole, it seems to me that
                            it is perhaps as well to let it stay for the present in the situation in
                            which her Majesty’s ministers have placed it. But in this I remain to be
                            directed at the pleasure of the President.</p>
                        <p>In this connexion I have the honor to transmit a copy of Lord Russell’s
                            note of the 28th of August, in reply to mine of the 23d of that month to
                            him, already referred to in the preceding paragraph. I likewise send a
                            copy of his instructions to Lord Lyons, which he seems to have furnished
                            to me as an evidence of his good faith in the representation he made of
                            them to me at the conference.</p>

                            <p>The undersigned, her Majesty’s principal secretary of state for
                                foreign affairs, has had the honor to receive the note, of the 23d
                                instant, of Mr. Adams, envoy extraordinary and minister
                                plenipotentiary of the United States.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Adams has accounted satisfactorily for the delay in answering the
                                note of the undersigned of the 19th instant. Her Majesty’s
                                government in all these transactions has acted in concert with the
                                government of the <pb n="145" xml:id="pg_145" facs="0145"/> Emperor
                                of the French, and the undersigned cannot be surprised that Mr.
                                Adams should wish to communicate with Mr. Dayton, at Paris, before
                                replying to his note.</p>
                            <p>The undersigned is quite prepared, following Mr. Adams to
                                recapitulate the particulars of this negotiation, and he is happy to
                                think that in matters of fact there is no ground for any controversy
                                between them. He need only supply omissions.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Adams, at his first interview with the undersigned, on the 18th
                                of May last, mentioned the subject of the declaration of Paris as
                                one on which he had power to negotiate, and the undersigned then
                                told him that the matter had been already committed to the care of
                                Lord Lyons, at Washington, with authority to agree with the
                                government of the United States on the basis of the adoption of
                                three of the articles and the omission of the first, being that
                                relating to privateering. So far, the statement of Mr. Adams agrees
                                substantially with that which is here made. But the representation
                                of the undersigned was strictly accurate, and in faith of it he
                                subjoins the despatch by which Lord Lyons was authorized to
                                negotiate on the basis of the three latter articles of the
                                declaration of Paris. Lord Lyons, however, was not empowered to sign
                                a convention, because that form had not been adopted by the powers
                                who originally signed the declaration, nor by any of the numerous
                                states which afterwards gave their adherence to its articles.</p>
                            <p>At a later period, when Mr. Adams brought a copy of his full powers
                                to the foreign office, the undersigned asked why the adherence of
                                the United States should not be given in the same form as that of
                                other powers, and he was told, in reply, that as the Constitution of
                                the United States required the consent of the Senate to any
                                agreement with foreign powers, that agreement must necessarily, or
                                at least would most conveniently, be made in the shape of a
                                convention.</p>
                            <p>The undersigned yielded to this argument, and proposed to the
                                government of the Emperor of the French, with which her Majesty’s
                                government have been acting throughout in complete agreement, to
                                concur likewise in this departure from the form in which the
                                declaration of Paris had been adopted by the maritime powers of
                                Europe.</p>
                            <p>But the British government could not sign the convention proposed by
                                the United States as an act of Great Britain singly and alone, and
                                they found to their surprise that in case of France and of some of
                                the other European powers the addition of Mr. Marcy relating to
                                private property at sea had been proposed by the ministers of the
                                United States at the courts of those powers.</p>
                            <p>The undersigned concurs in the statement made by Mr. Adams respecting
                                the transactions which followed. Her Majesty’s government, like Mr.
                                Adams, wished to establish a doctrine for all time, with a view to
                                lessen the horrors of war all over the globe. The instructions sent
                                to Lord Lyons prove the sincerity of their wish to give permanence
                                and fixity of principles to this part of the law of nations.</p>
                            <p>The undersigned has now arrived at that part of the subject upon
                                which the negotiation is interrupted.</p>
                            <p>The undersigned has notified Mr. Adams his intention to accompany his
                                signature of the proposed convention with a declaration to the
                                effect that her Majesty “does not intend thereby to undertake any
                                engagement which shall have any bearing, direct or indirect, on the
                                internal differences now prevailing in the United States.”</p>
                            <p>The reasons for this course can be easily explained. On some recent
                                occasions, as on the fulfilment of the treaty of 1846, respecting
                                the boundary, and with respect to the treaty called by the name of
                                the “Clayton-Bulwer treaty,” <pb n="146" xml:id="pg_146" facs="0146"
                                /> serious differences have arisen with regard to the precise
                                meaning of words, and the intention of those who framed them.</p>
                            <p>It was most desirable in framing a new agreement not to give rise to
                                a fresh dispute.</p>
                            <p>But the different attitude of Great Britain and of the United States
                                in regard to the internal dissensions now unhappily prevailing in
                                the United States gave warning that such a dispute might arise out
                                of the proposed convention.</p>
                            <p>Her Majesty’s government, upon receiving intelligence that the
                                President had declared by proclamation his intention to blockade the
                                ports of nine of the States of the Union, and that Mr. Davis,
                                speaking in the name of those nine States, had declared his
                                intention to issue letters of marque and reprisals; and having also
                                received certain information of the design of both sides to arm, had
                                come to the conclusion that civil war existed in America, and her
                                Majesty had thereupon proclaimed her neutrality in the approaching
                                contest.</p>
                            <p>The government of the United States, on the other hand, spoke only of
                                unlawful combinations, and designated those concerned in them as
                                rebels and pirates. It would follow logically and consistently, from
                                the attitude taken by her Majesty’s government, that the so-called
                                Confederate States, being acknowledged as a belligerent, might, by
                                the law of nations, arm privateers, and that their privateers must
                                be regarded as the armed vessels of a belligerent.</p>
                            <p>With equal logic and consistency it would follow, from the position
                                taken by the United States, that the privateers of the southern
                                States might be decreed to be pirates, and it might be further
                                argued by the government of the United States that a European power
                                signing a convention with the United States, declaring that
                                privateering was and remains abolished, would be bound to treat the
                                privateers of the so-called Confederate States as pirates.</p>
                            <p>Hence, instead of an agreement, charges of bad faith and violation of
                                a convention might be brought in the United States against the power
                                signing such a convention, and treating the privateers of the
                                so-called Confederate States as those of a belligerent power.</p>
                            <p>The undersigned had at first intended to make verbally the
                                declaration proposed. But he considered it would be more clear, more
                                open, more fair to Mr. Adams to put the declaration in writing, and
                                give notice of it to Mr. Adams before signing the convention.</p>
                            <p>The undersigned will not now reply to the reasons given by Mr. Adams
                                for not signing the convention if accompanied by the proposed
                                declaration. Her Majesty’s government wish the question to be fairly
                                weighed by the United States government. The undersigned, like Mr.
                                Adams, wishes to maintain and perpetuate the most friendly relations
                                between her Majesty’s kingdom and the United States. It is in this
                                spirit that her Majesty’s government decline to bind themselves
                                without a clear explanation on their part to a convention, which,
                                seemingly confined to an adoption of the declaration of Paris of
                                1856, might be construed as an engagement to interfere in the
                                unhappy dissensions now prevailing in the United States—an
                                interference which would be contrary to her Majesty’s public
                                declarations, and would be a reversal of the policy which her
                                Majesty has deliberately sanctioned.</p>
                            <p>The undersigned requests Mr. Adams to accept the assurance of his
                                highest consideration.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Lord</hi>: Her Majesty’s government deeply
                                lament the outbreak of hostilities in North America, and they would
                                gladly lend their aid to the restoration of peace.</p>
                            <p>You are instructed, therefore, in case you should be asked to employ
                                your good offices either singly or in conjunction with the
                                representatives of other powers, to give your assistance in
                                promoting the work of reconciliation. But as it is most probable,
                                especially after a recent letter of Mr. Seward, that foreign advice
                                is not likely to be accepted, you will refrain from offering it
                                unasked. Such being the case, and supposing the contest not to be at
                                once ended by signal success on one side or by the return of
                                friendly feeling between the two contending parties, her Majesty’s
                                government have to consider what will be the position of Great
                                Britain as a neutral between the two belligerents.</p>
                            <p>So far as the position of Great Britain in this respect toward the
                                European powers is concerned, that position has been greatly
                                modified by the declaration of Paris of April 16, 1856. That
                                declaration was signed by the ministers of Austria, France, Great
                                Britain, Prussia, Russia, Sardinia, and Turkey.</p>
                            <p>The motives for making that declaration, and for agreeing to the
                                articles of maratime law which it proposes to introduce with a view
                                to the establishment of a “uniform doctrine” and “fixed principles,”
                                are thus shortly enumerated in the declaration:</p>
                            <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Considering that maritime law in time of war has long been the

                                <p>“That the uncertainty of the law and of the duties in such a
                                    matter gives rise to differences of opinion between neutrals and
                                    belligerents which may occasion serious difficulties and even
                                    conflicts;</p>

                                    relations fixed principles in this respect—</p>

                                agreed that “the present declaration is not and shall not be

                            <p>Mr. Secretary Marcy, in acknowledging, on the 28th of July, 1856, the
                                communication of the declaration of Paris made to the government of
                                the United States by the Count de Sartiges, proposed to add to the
                                first article thereof the following words: “and that the private
                                property of the subjects or citizens of a belligerent on the high
                                seas shall be exempted from seizure by public armed vessels of the
                                other belligerents, except it be contraband;” and Mr. Marcy
                                expressed the willingness of the government of the United States to
                                adopt the clause so amended, together with the other three
                                principles contained in the declaration.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Marcy also stated that he was directed to communicate the
                                approval of the President of the second, third, and fourth
                                propositions, independently of the first, should the proposed
                                amendment of the first article be unacceptable.</p>
                            <p>The United States minister in London, on the 24th of February, 1857,
                                renewed the proposal in regard to the first article, and submitted a
                                draft of convention, in which the article so amended would be
                                embodied with the other three articles. But, before any decision was
                                taken on this proposal, a change took place in the American
                                government by the election of a new President of the United States,
                                and Mr. Dallas announced, on the 25th of April, 1857, that he was
                                directed to suspend negotiations on the subject; up to the present
                                time those negotiations have not been renewed.</p>
                            <p>The consequence is, that the United States remaining outside the
                                provisions of the declaration of Paris, the uncertainty of the law
                                and of international duties with regard to such matters may give
                                rise to differences of opinion between neutrals and belligerents
                                which may occasion serious difficulties and even conflicts.</p>
                            <p>It is with a view to remove beforehand such “difficulties,” and to
                                prevent such “conflicts,” that I now address you.</p>
                            <p>For this purpose I proceed to remark on the four articles, beginning,
                                not with the first, but with the last.</p>
                            <p>In a letter to the Earl of Clarenden of the 24th of February, 1857,
                                Mr. Dallas, the minister of the United States, while submitting the
                                draft of a new convention, explains the views of the government of
                                the United States on the four articles.</p>
                            <p>In reference to the last article, he says: “The fourth of those
                                principles, respecting blockades, had, it is believed, long since
                                become a fixed rule of the law of war.”</p>
                            <p>There can be no difference of opinion, therefore, with regard to the
                                fourth article.</p>
                            <p>With respect to the third article, the principle laid down in it has
                                long been recognized as law, both in Great Britain and in the United
                                States. Indeed this part of the law is stated by Chancellor Kent to
                                be uniform in the two countries.</p>
                            <p>With respect to the second article, Mr. Dallas says, in the letter
                                before quoted: “About two years prior to the meeting of congress at
                                Paris, negotiations had been originated and were in train with the
                                maritime nations for the adoption of the second and third
                                propositions substantially as enumerated in the declaration.”</p>
                            <p>The United States have therefore no objection in principle to the
                                second proposition.</p>
                            <p>Indeed her Majesty’s government have to remark that this principle is
                                adopted in the treaties between the United States and Russia of the
                                22d of July, 1854, and was sanctioned by the United States in the
                                earliest period <pb n="149" xml:id="pg_149" facs="0149"/> of the
                                history of their independence by their accession to the armed
                                neutrality.</p>
                            <p>With Great Britain the case has been different. She formerly
                                contended for the opposite principles as the established rule of the
                                law of nations.</p>
                            <p>But having, in 1856, upon full consideration, determined to depart
                                from that rule, she means to adhere to the principle she then
                                adopted. The United States, who have always desired this change,
                                can, it may be presumed, have no difficulty in assenting to the
                                principle set forth in the second article of the declaration of
                                Paris.</p>
                            <p>There remains only to be considered the first article, namely, that
                                relating to privateering, from which the government of the United
                                States withhold their assent. Under these circumstances it is
                                expedient to consider what is required on this subject by the
                                general law of nations. Now, it must be borne in mind that
                                privateers bearing the flag of one or other of the belligerents may
                                be manned by lawless and abandoned men, who may commit, for the sake
                                of plunder, the most destructive and sanguinary outrages.</p>
                            <p>There can be no question but that the commander and crew of the ship
                                bearing a letter of marque must, by law of nations, carry on their
                                hostilities according to the established laws of war. Her Majesty’s
                                government must, therefore, hold any government issuing such letters
                                of marque responsible for, and liable to make good, any losses
                                sustained by her Majesty’s subjects in consequence of wrongful
                                proceeding of vessels sailing under such letters of marque.</p>
                            <p>In this way the object of the declaration of Paris may, to a certain
                                extent, be attained without the adoption of any new principle.</p>
                            <p>You will urge these views upon Mr. Seward.</p>
                            <p>The proposals of her Majesty’s government are made with a view to
                                limit and restrain that destruction of property and that
                                interruption of trade which must, in a greater or less degree, be
                                the inevitable consequence of the present hostilities. Her Majesty’s
                                government expect that these proposals will be received by the
                                United States government in a friendly spirit. If such shall be the
                                case, you will endeavor (in concert with M. Mercier) to come to an
                                agreement on the subject binding France, Great Britain, and the
                                United States.</p>
                            <p>If these proposals should, however, be rejected, her Majesty’s
                                government will consider what other steps should be taken with a
                                view to protect from wrong and injury the trade and the property and
                                persons of British subjects.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            reception at the hands of your messenger, Captain Schultz, of a bag
                            purporting to contain public despatches from Mr. Robert Bunch, the
                            consul at Charleston, to Lord Russell, the head of the foreign office in
                            London. In conformity with the instructions contained in your No. 63,
                            dated the 17th of August, I immediately addressed a note to Lord
                            Russull, explanatory of the reasons why such a bag was received through
                            this channel, a copy of which is herewith transmitted. In it you will
                            perceive that I have endeavored to adhere as closely as possible to <pb
                                n="150" xml:id="pg_150" facs="0150"/> the language of your
                            communication to me. At the same time, in obedience to the directions
                            contained in your No. 64, dated the 17th of August, I addressed another
                            note to his lordship stating the grounds of dissatisfaction felt by the
                            President with the conduct of Mr. Bunch, and requesting his removal. A
                            copy of this note is likewise appended to the present despatch. These
                            two notes, together with the bag in exactly the same condition in which
                            I received it from Captain Schultz, I directed my assistant secretary,
                            Mr. Benjamin Moran, to take with him to the foreign office, and there to
                            deliver into the hands of his lordship if present, or, if absent from
                            town, into those of one of her Majesty’s under secretaries of state for
                            foreign affairs. Accordingly, on the afternoon of Tuesday, the 4th
                            instant, at about quarter past three o’clock, as Mr. Moran reports to
                            me, he went to the foreign office, and finding Lord Russell to be absent
                            from town, he delivered the bag and the notes into the hands of Mr.
                            Layard, one of the under secretaries. Since that time I have had no
                            reply from his lordship, although I received on Saturday last two notes
                            from him on matters of minor consequence. I had hoped to send something
                            by Captain Schultz, who returns in the Great Eastern, and I shall yet do
                            so if it should come before the bag closes. I have consented to the
                            departure of Captain Schultz, mainly because Mr. Dayton has expressed a
                            great desire that he should take charge of his despatches as soon as
                            possible.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant,</p>

                                valued at £80,000 sterling. The importance of intercepting her
                                cannot be overestimated.</p>

                            <p>It now becomes my duty to explain the circumstances under which this
                                bag has found its way from the possession of the person to whom it
                                was originally intrusted into that of the authorities of the United
                                States.</p>
                            <p>It appears that the Secretary of State of the United States, on the
                                15th of August last, received information deemed worthy of
                                confidence that Mr. Robert Mure, the bearer of this bag, was at the
                                same time acting as a bearer of despatches from the insurrectionary
                                authorities of Richmond to your lordship. Other information came
                                that he was a bearer of despatches from the same authorities to
                                their agents in London. And still other information from various
                                sources agreed in affirming that he was travelling under a passport
                                issued by her Majesty’s consul at Charleston. Upon this information,
                                instructions were sent forthwith to the police of New York to detain
                                Mr. Mure, and any papers which might be found in his possession. He
                                was accordingly detained, and is now in custody at Fort Layfette,
                                awaiting full disclosures. A large number of papers were found upon
                                him, an examination of which was found fully to sustain some
                                portions of the information which had been furnished, and to prove
                                that Mr. Mure was acting as the bearer of a treasonable
                                correspondence between persons acting in open arms against the
                                government of the United States and their friends and emissaries in
                                Great Britain. He had also with him several copies of a printed
                                pamphlet purporting to be a narrative of the events of the 21st of
                                July at Manassas Junction, addressed to persons in England, and
                                evidently intended to further the purposes of the conspirators in
                                South Carolina.</p>
                            <p>Robert Mure, the bearer of these papers, is represented to be a
                                naturalized citizen of the United States, where he has resided for
                                thirty years, and as actually holding a commission of colonel in the
                                insurgent forces of South Carolina.</p>
                            <p>It turned out to be true that in the hands of this gentleman were
                                found in an open envelope a paper purporting to be a passport, a
                                copy of which I have the honor to append to this note as paper
                                marked A; and a letter of instructions, signed by Robert Bunch, her
                                Majesty’s consul for the United States, residing at Charleston, a
                                copy of which is likewise appended, as paper marked B.</p>
                            <p>In the absence of all other evidence against Mr. Bunch to prove his
                                departure from the line of his legitimate duty, it is quite enough
                                to call the attention of your lordship to the fact that in issuing
                                such a paper as this passport he has acted in direct contravention
                                of a regulation issued by the proper department of the United States
                                of which he had received notice, which forbids all recognition of
                                any diplomatic or consular passport so far as to permit the bearer
                                to pass through the lines of the national forces or out of the
                                country unless it should be countersigned by the Secretary of State
                                and the commanding general of the army of the United States. Mr.
                                Mure attempted to do both with a paper bearing no such
                                signatures.</p>
                            <p>There is, however, other and still more serious cause of complaint
                                against Mr. Bunch, as disclosed by the papers of Mr. Mure, the
                                exposition of which I am compelled to reserve for a separate
                                communication. The present purpose is confined to an explanation of
                                the reasons which have actuated the government of the United States
                                in taking the extraordinary step which has had for one of its
                                consequences the effect of diverting, be it but for a moment, a part
                                of the official correspondence of her Majesty’s government from the
                                channel in which it was originally placed. I am directed to express
                                the regret the government feels that such a measure had become
                                imperative, and to assure your lordship of its earnest desire to
                                make any suitable amends which may justly be required. If in the
                                process there may have happened a slight interruption of the
                                correspondence of the British consul, <pb n="152" xml:id="pg_152"
                                    facs="0152"/> it is their desire that the pressing nature of the
                                emergency may induce your lordship to excuse it.</p>
                            <p>It is needless to say that the bag passes into the hands of your
                                lordship in precisely the same condition it came from those of Mr.
                                Mure. Comity towards the government of a friendly nation, together
                                with a full confidence in its justice and honor, to say nothing of a
                                sense of propriety, would deter the government which I have the
                                honor to represent from entertaining the idea of breaking the seals
                                which protect it even were there ten times more reason than there is
                                to presume an intention under so sacred a sanction to perpetrate a
                                wrong certainly on one and perhaps on both governments. Still less
                                is it the intention of the American government to intimate the
                                smallest suspicion of any privity whatever on the part of the
                                authorities in Great Britain in aiding, assisting, or countenancing
                                a supposed design injurious to the United States and subversive of
                                their sovereignty. Much ground as there is for presuming that it
                                never was the intention of those who prepared the package to forward
                                it to its nominal address, but that it was rather the design, after
                                bringing bad matter under this sacred sanction safely through the
                                dangers of hostile scrutiny, to open the bag themselves and to
                                disseminate the contents far and wide among the evil-disposed
                                emissaries to be found scattered all over Europe; this consideration
                                has never weighed a single moment to change their views of this
                                trust when put in the balance with the strong reliance placed upon
                                the good faith of her Majesty’s constitutional advisers. Least of
                                all has it been in the thought of any one that your lordship would
                                consent in any way to receive the papers, if they are really illegal
                                in their character or dangerous or injurious to the United
                                States.</p>
                            <p>Should it, however, prove on inspection that any abuse has been
                                attempted in America of the confidence to which her Majesty’s
                                government is in every way entitled, I am directed to express to
                                your lordship the hope that any papers of a treasonable character
                                against the United States may be delivered up to me for the use of
                                my government, and that her Majesty’s consul at Charleston, if shown
                                to be privy to the transmission of them under such a form, may be
                                made promptly to feel the severe displeasure of the government whose
                                good faith he has sought to dishonor. For there can be no difference
                                of opinion as to the nature of an offence which involves the
                                perversion by the agent of one government of the hospitality
                                afforded to him by another to conspire against its safety, dignity,
                                and honor.</p>
                            <p>I pray your lordship to accept the assurances of the highest
                                consideration with which I have the honor to be your lordship’s most
                                obedient servant,</p>

                            <p>The undersigned, envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of
                                the United States, deeply regrets the painful necessity that compels
                                him to make a representation to the right honorable Lord Russell,
                                her Majesty’s principal secretary of state for foreign affairs,
                                touching the conduct of Mr. Robert Bunch, her Majesty’s consul for
                                the port of Charleston, in the United States. It appears from the
                                contents of one of the many letters found in the possession of Mr.
                                Robert Mure, bearer of despatches from Mr. Bunch to the <pb n="153"
                                    xml:id="pg_153" facs="0153"/> government of Great Britain, but
                                detained as an agent of the enemies of the United States, that the
                                following statement is made of the action of Mr. Bunch in
                                Charleston.</p>
                            <p>“Mr. B., on oath of secrecy, communicated to me also that <hi
                                    rend="italic">the first step</hi> to recognition was taken. He
                                and Mr. Belligny together sent Mr. Trescot to Richmond yesterday to,
                                ask Jeff. Davis, President to _______ the treaty of ______ to ______
                                the neutral flag covering neutral goods to be respected. This is the
                                first step of direct treating with our government. So prepare for
                                active business by 1st January.”</p>
                            <p>The undersigned is instructed to submit this information to her
                                Majesty’s government with a request that, if it be found to be
                                correct, Mr. Bunch may be at once removed from his office. The
                                undersigned is further instructed to add that the President will
                                cheerfully accord an exequatur to any person who maybe appointed to
                                succeed him, who will faithfully perform his functions without
                                injury to the rights and the interests of the United States.</p>

                                Russell the assurances of his highest consideration.</p>

                            received from Mr. Francis Bernard, in the island of Trinidad. It shows a
                            clear case of connivance by the authorities of that island with the
                            insurgents of the United States, in violation of the rights and dignity
                            of this government, if the facts are truly presented. You will bring the
                            subject to the notice of Lord Russell, and will, if the case shall not
                            be satisfactorily explained, ask for such proceedings in the premises as
                            shall make the authorities of the island sensible of the displeasure of
                            the imperial government, and prevent such occurrences in the future.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I beg to inform you that on the 30th
                                ultimo a steam sloop-of-war (Semmes commander) carrying a secession
                                flag, five guns, some of a large calibre, and a crew of from 120 to
                                150 men, sailed boldly in our harbor and reported herself to the
                                authorities of this island as being on a cruise. She was last from
                                Puerto Cabello; and since she succeeded in getting out of the
                                Mississippi river she has already captured no less than eleven
                                American vessels. I have ascertained the names of some of them, viz:
                                the Joseph Maxwell, Abe Bradford, Minnie Miller, West Wind, of
                                Westerly, with a <pb n="154" xml:id="pg_154" facs="0154"/> cargo of
                                sugar from Havana, and Golden Rocket, which was burnt by her off the
                                coast of Cuba.</p>
                            <p>The Sumter landed eight of her prisoners here in a destitute
                                condition; but a contribution has been raised here for their
                                benefit, sufficient to supply their immediate wants, and I will take
                                care that they are provided for till an opportunity offers to ship
                                them to the States.</p>
                            <p>The Sumter remained here till the 5th instant, and was allowed to
                                supply herself with coals and other necessary outfits. The British
                                flag was hoisted on the government flag-staff for her arrival, and
                                the officers of the British war vessel “Cadmus” appeared to be on
                                amicable terms with those of the Sumter. The merchant who supplied
                                the Sumter with coals did it with the consent and approval of our
                                attorney general.</p>
                            <p>Being a loyal American, I consider it my duty to send you these
                                informations, as there has been no consul of our nation in this
                                island for many months.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I transmit a copy of an intercepted letter
                            of the 30th of July last, from John P. Baldwin, of Richmond, Virginia,
                            to Henry Adderley, at Nassau, New Providence, relative to the shipment
                            of arms and powder from that place for the use of the insurgents in this
                            country. The existing British statute for the prevention of armed
                            expeditions against countries at peace with Great Britain is understood
                            to be similar to our act of Congress of the 5th of April, 1818.
                            Proceedings like that referred to in the letter of Baldwin, however,
                            afford us special reason to expect legislation on the part of the
                            British government of the character of our act of 1838, referred to in
                            my instruction to you of the 7th instant, numbered 83. It may be,
                            however, that the British executive government now has the power to
                            prevent the exportation of contraband of war from British colonies near
                            the United States for the use of the insurgents in the south. Should
                            this be the fact, you will bring the subject to the attention of Lord
                            Russell, and request that proper instructions in regard to it may be
                            given to the colonial authorities.</p>

                            two notes received yesterday from Lord Russell, in answer to my notes of
                            the 3d of September, transmitting to him the bag of Mr. Bunch. It
                            appears from one of them that Mr. Bunch has been acting under secret
                            instructions, which are only now acknowledged because they have come to
                            light, and that his granting a safe conduct to an emissary of secession,
                            charged with treasonable papers, is no objection to his neutral
                            character in the eyes of his employers. With regard to the question
                            presented in the other note, it is satisfactory to me, at least in so
                            far as it devolves all responsibility for the further treatment of the
                            question into more capable hands. I transmit also a copy of my
                            reply.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I received, with some surprise, from
                                Lord Lyons an intimation that a sealed bag, directed by one of her
                                Majesty’s consuls to her Majesty’s secretary of state, had been
                                seized and detained by order of the Secretary of State of the United
                                States.</p>
                            <pb n="156" xml:id="pg_156" facs="0156"/>
                            <p>It seems to have been suspected that her Majesty’s consul had
                                inserted in his official bag, and covered with his official seal,
                                the correspondence of the enemies of the government of the United
                                States now engaged in open hostilities against them.</p>
                            <p>Had her Majesty’s consul so acted he would have, no doubt, been
                                guilty of a grave breach of his duty both towards his own government
                                and that of the United States; but I am happy to say there does not
                                appear, on opening the bag at the foreign office, to be any ground
                                for such a suspicion.</p>
                            <p>Her Majesty’s government were advised that the suspension of the
                                conveyance by post of letters from British subjects between the
                                northern and the southern States, was a contravention of the treaty
                                on this subject contracted by the two governments. Her Majesty’s
                                government have been unwilling to press this view on the United
                                States; but this stoppage of the post has occasioned great
                                inconvenience to individuals, and I enclose a copy of a note from
                                Mr. Bunch to the under secretary of foreign affairs, showing the
                                mode in which he has endeavored to palliate the evil by enclosing
                                private letters in his consular bag.</p>
                            <p>I shall address any further communication I may have to make on this
                                subject to Lord Lyons.</p>

                            <p>Mr. Bunch presents his compliments to her Majesty’s under secretary
                                of state for foreign affairs, and takes leave to enclose to him
                                herewith certain letters which are intended for the post.</p>
                            <p>They are principally letters of servants, governesses, &amp;c.,
                                (British subjects,) which, owing to the discontinuance of the post,
                                they are unable to send in any other way. Some also contain
                                dividends, the property of British subjects, which they could
                                scarcely receive without Mr. Bunch’s intervention.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Bunch hopes that there is no irregularity in this proceeding. No
                                expense of postage is incurred by the foreign office, as the bag in
                                which the letters are contained goes by a private hand to
                                Liverpool.</p>

                                foreign affairs, has received a communication from Mr. Adams, envoy
                                extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of the United States at
                                this court, dated the 3d instant, giving some information regarding
                                the conduct of Mr. Bunch, her Majesty’s consul at Charleston, in the
                                United States, and requesting, on the part of the government of the
                                United States, that Mr. Bunch may at once be removed from his
                                office.</p>
                            <p>The undersigned will, without hesitation, state to Mr. Adams that in
                                pursuance of an agreement between the British and French
                                governments, Mr. Bunch was instructed to communicate to the persons
                                exercising authority in the so-called Confederate States, the desire
                                of those governments, that the <pb n="157" xml:id="pg_157"
                                    facs="0157"/> second, third, and fourth articles of the
                                declaration of Paris should be observed by those States in the
                                prosecution of the hostilities in which they were engaged. Mr. Adams
                                will observe that the commerce of Great Britain and France is deeply
                                interested in the maintenance of the articles providing that the
                                flag covers the goods, and that the goods of a neutral taken on
                                board a belligerent ship are not liable to condemnation.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Bunch, therefore, in what he has done in this matter, has acted
                                in obedience to the instructions of his government, who accept the
                                responsibility of his proceedings so far as they are known to the
                                foreign department, and who cannot remove him from his office for
                                having obeyed his instructions.</p>
                            <p>But when it is stated in a letter from some person not named, that
                                the first step to the recognition of the southern States by Great
                                Britain has been taken, the undersigned has to decline all
                                responsibility for such statement.</p>
                            <p>Her Majesty’s government have already recognized the belligerent
                                character of the southern States, and they will continue to consider
                                them as belligerents. But her Majesty’s government have not
                                recognized, and are not prepared to recognize the so-called
                                Confederate States as a separate and independent State.</p>
                            <p>The undersigned requests Mr. Adams to accept the assurance of his
                                highest consideration.</p>

                            just been received. Your note to Lord John Russell, which accompanies
                            it, is approved. My despatch to you, (No. 83,) under the date of the 7th
                            instant, will have reached you before this communication can arrive. You
                            will have learned from that paper that your course, as now made known to

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your despatch of September 7 (No. 39) has
                            just been received. Your review of the correspondence between us and the
                            British government since you entered upon your mission is quite
                            satisfactory, and we have every reason to be content with the details as
                            with the results.</p>
                        <p>The time which has elapsed since the insurgents made their first
                            unnatural appeal to the sympathies and aid of foreign powers for the
                            overthrow of our government has been sufficient to draw out all their
                            strength and exhaust in some measure their passion. On the other hand,
                            the strength of the Union manifests itself with constant augmentation.
                            Every day brings two thousand men and some new ship-of-war into
                            activity, and the insurrection, already, is finding itself obliged to
                            provide for a long and merely defensive contest, desolating the States
                            which should constitute the new confederacy, while the loyal States
                            remain prosperous and happy.</p>
                        <p>I think that Great Britain will soon be able to see, what she has
                            hitherto been unwilling to see, that, if she, like ourselves, seeks
                            peace and prosperity <pb n="159" xml:id="pg_159" facs="0159"/> on this
                            continent, she can most effectually contribute to their restoration by
                            manifesting her wishes for the success of this government in suppressing
                            the insurrection as speedily as possible.</p>

                        <p>Sir: * * * * * * * *</p>
                        <p>During my stay at Abergeldie I alluded to instructions received at the
                            moment of my leaving London, in your despatch, No. 84, of the 10th of
                            September, directing me to make a complaint of the authorities at
                            Trinidad for their mode of reception of the insurgent privateer, the
                            Sumter. I read to him the copy of the letter of Mr. Bernard, which was
                            enclosed. But I contented myself with only mentioning the subject, as I
                            said I supposed I should be obliged to present the case hereafter, in a
                            more formal way, in writing.</p>
                        <p>His lordship expressed a wish that I should take that course. The matter
                            had already come before the colonial office, and it had been referred to
                            the law officers of the crown, to report what was the action proper to
                            be taken in similar cases.</p>
                        <p rend="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I am much gratified to perceive, by the
                            terms of your despatch, No. 83, dated the 7th of this month, a
                            substantial ratification of the position taken by me in regard to Lord
                            Russell’s note of the 19th of August, and to the declaration which he
                            proposed to append to the convention concerning neutral rights. I find
                            in it, too, a general coincidence in the argument presented by me in my
                            reply to his lordship on the 23d of August, a copy of which could not
                            have reached the department down to the latest dates yet received. There
                            are some views offered, however, in my note, which are not touched upon
                            in that despatch. I am, therefore, not as yet fully certain whether, as
                            a whole, it has met with the approbation of the President. For this
                            reason I decided not to hold communication on the subject with Lord
                            Russell, during the time of my late stay under his roof, but rather to
                            wait until after the arrival of the next despatches from the department,
                            which will probably bring a final review of the negotiation, as it
                            appears, after an examination of all the papers that belong to it. I
                            shall then be in a position to judge of the propriety of any further
                            action which it may be advisable to pursue. His lordship informed me, on
                            my taking leave of him, that he expected to return to London by the 14th
                            of next month, after which I anticipate no delay, like the late one, in
                            the transaction of important business.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant,</p>

                            <p>The undersigned, envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of
                                the United States, regrets to be obliged to inform the right
                                honorable Earl Russell, her Majesty’s principal secretary of state
                                for foreign affairs, that he has been instructed by the President of
                                the United States to prefer a complaint against the authorities of
                                the island of Trinidad for a violation of her Majesty’s proclamation
                                of neutrality, by giving aid and encouragement to the insurgents of
                                the United States. It appears by an extract from a letter received
                                at the Department of State from a gentleman believed to be worthy of
                                credit, a resident of Trinidad, Mr. Francis Bernard, a copy of which
                                is submitted herewith, that a steam vessel, known as an armed
                                insurgent privateer, called the Sumter, was received on the 30th of
                                July last at that port, and was permitted to remain for six days,
                                during which time she was not only furnished with all necessary
                                supplies for the continuance of her cruise, under the sanction of
                                the attorney general, but that her Majesty’s flag was actually
                                hoisted on the government flag-staff in acknowledgment of her
                                arrival.</p>
                            <p>The undersigned has been directed by his government to bring this
                                extraordinary proceeding to the attention of Lord Russell, and, in
                                case it shall not be satisfactorily explained, to ask for the
                                adoption of such measures as shall insure, on the part of the
                                authorities of the island, the prevention of all occurrences of the
                                kind during the continuance of the difficulties in America.</p>
                            <p>The undersigned deems it proper to add, in explanation of the absence
                                of any official representation from Trinidad to substantiate the
                                present complaint, that there was no consul of the United States
                                there at the time of the arrival of the vessel. The undersigned had
                                the honor, a few days since, to apprise Lord Russell of the fact
                                that this deficiency had been since supplied, by preferring an
                                application for her Majesty’s exequator for a new consul, who is
                                already on his way to occupy his post.</p>
                            <p>The undersigned begs to renew to Earl Russell the assurances of his
                                highest consideration.</p>

                            <p>The undersigned, her Majesty’s principal secretary of state for
                                foreign affairs, has had the honor to receive a complaint from Mr.
                                Adams, envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of the
                                United States at this court, against the authorities of the island
                                of Trinidad for a violation of her Majesty’s proclamation of
                                neutrality, by giving aid and encouragement to the insurgents of the
                                United States.</p>
                            <p>It appears, from the accounts received at the colonial office and at
                                the admiralty, that a vessel bearing a secession flag entered the
                                port of Trinidad on the 30th of July last.</p>
                            <p>Captain Hillyar, of her Majesty’s ship “Cadmus,” having sent a boat
                                to ascertain her nationality, the commanding officer showed a
                                commission signed by Mr. Jefferson Davis, calling himself the
                                President of the so-styled Confederate States.</p>
                            <p>The “Sumter,” which was the vessel in question, was allowed to stay
                                six days at Trinidad, and to supply herself with coals and
                                provisions, and the attorney general of the island perceived no
                                illegality in these proceedings.</p>
                            <p>The law officers of the crown have reported that the conduct of the
                                governor was in conformity to her Majesty’s proclamation.</p>
                            <pb n="163" xml:id="pg_163" facs="0163"/>
                            <p>No mention is made by the governor of his hoisting the British flag
                                on the government flag-staff; and if he did so, it was probably in
                                order to show the national character of the island, and not in
                                acknowledgment of the arrival of the “Sumter.”</p>
                            <p>There does not appear, therefore, any reason to believe that her
                                Majesty’s proclamation of neutrality has been violated by the
                                governor of Trinidad, or by the commanding officer of her Majesty’s
                                ship “Cadmus.”</p>
                            <p>The undersigned requests Mr. Adams to accept the assurance of his
                                highest consideration.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The receipt of your despatch of the 14th
                            of September (No. 44) has been already acknowledged.</p>
                        <p>It was accompanied by Earl Russell’s reply to the note which, in
                            execution of my instructions, you addressed to him on the subject of the
                            detention of a bearer of despatches sent by Robert Bunch, her Majesty’s
                            consul at Charleston, and the substitution by me of another person to
                            convey his consular bag to Great Britain.</p>
                        <p>Earl Russell says, in his note, that if it had been true (as we
                            apprehended) that Mr. Bunch had inserted into his official bag and
                            covered with his official seal the correspondence of the enemies of this
                            government in the United States, he would have been guilty of a grave
                            breach of his duty towards his own government and that of the United
                            States. Earl Russell says also, that on the opening of the bag at the
                            foreign office (in London) no ground for that suspicion was
                            revealed.</p>
                        <p>These declarations, made with unquestioned candor and freedom, are
                            entirety satisfactory upon the main point involved in your note. It is
                            therefore a pleasant duty for me to instruct you to reply to Earl
                            Russell that this government regrets the interruption of the passage of
                            the consular despatches, which has occurred in consequence of a mistaken
                            suspicion that the agent who transmitted them was abusing the confidence
                            of the two governments. I sincerely hope that no serious inconvenience
                            resulted from the delay.</p>
                        <p>Earl Russell, after making the explanations which I have quoted, proceeds
                            to remark that her Majesty’s government was advised that the suspicion
                            of the conveyance by post of letters from British subjects between the
                            northern States and the southern States was in contravention of the
                            treaty on this subject contracted between the two governments; that her
                            Majesty’s government had been, nevertheless, unwilling to press this
                            view on the United States; but that this stoppage of the post has
                            occasioned great inconvenience to individuals. His lordship then submits
                            a copy of a note which Mr. Bunch had written to the under secretary of
                            state, showing the mode in which he had endeavored to palliate the evil
                            by enclosing private letters in his official bag. His lordship then
                            dismisses the subject, saying that he shall address any further
                            communication he may have to make thereon, to Lord Lyons.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Bunch, in his note, states that he encloses in the bag, to the under
                            secretary’s address, certain letters which are intended for the post,
                            and that they are principally letters of servants, governesses, &amp;c.,
                            British subjects, <pb n="164" xml:id="pg_164" facs="0164"/> which, owing
                            to the discontinuance of the post, they are unable to send in any other
                            way; also, that some of the letters contain dividends, the property of
                            British subjects, which they could scarcely receive without Mr. Bunch’s
                            intervention. He adds that he hopes that there is no irregularity in
                            this proceeding, since no expense of postage is incurred, because the
                            bag in which the letters are contained goes by a private hand to
                            Liverpool. I read this note under the light thrown upon it by the
                            explanations of Earl Russell, which show that the whole correspondence
                            contained in the bag was innocent.</p>
                        <p>In these circumstances, what remains open to special exception in Mr.
                            Bunch’s proceeding is, his substitution of his consular bag and official
                            seal for the mail bag and mail locks of the United States, and of his
                            own mail carrier for the mail carriers of the United States.</p>
                        <p>The proceeding of the consul in these respects, certainly is not
                            defensible on any ground of treaty or international law; nor does Earl
                            Russell in any way imply that he deems it is so. The proceeding however
                            was practically harmless, and it is not likely to be repeated.</p>
                        <p>I confess to the fact of the interruption of the post, and also that it
                            works literally a non-fulfilment of a treaty stipulation. I deplore it
                            for that reason, as well as for the public and private injuries that it
                            occasions, not only abroad but at home. But the British government is
                            well aware that the interruption has occurred, not through the
                            deliberate or even voluntary consent of the government, but through the
                            sudden violence of an insurrection which has not only obstructed the
                            mails, but which even seeks to overthrow not only the treaty in
                            question, but even the government of the United States and the Union
                            itself, which constitutes them one treaty-making and treaty-observing
                            nation. Suppression of the correspondence between parties in that nation
                            with each other in this country and in foreign countries is a measure
                            which is essential to the suppression of the insurrection itself, and to
                            a complete restoration of the functions of the government throughout the
                            Union. I feel sure that the magnanimity of the British government may be
                            relied upon not to complain, at one and the same time, of the breach of
                            our international postal treaty under such circumstances, and of our
                            resort to a measure which is indispensable to complete our ability to
                            fulfil it.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I recur once more to your despatch of
                            September 14, No. 44. On the 3d of that month you addressed a note to
                            Earl Russell, in which you informed him, by my direction, that from the
                            contents of the many letters found in the possession of Mr. Robert Mure,
                            bearer of despatches to the government of Great Britain, but detained at
                            New York as an agent of the enemies of the United States, the following
                            statement is made of the action of Mr. Bunch in Charleston. “Mr. Bunch,
                            on oath of secrecy, communicated to me also that the first step to
                            recognition was taken; that he and Mr. Belligny together sent Mr.
                            Trescot to Richmond yesterday to ask Jeff. <pb n="165" xml:id="pg_165"
                                facs="0165"/> Davis, President, to ____ the treaty of ____ to ____
                            the neutral flag covering neutral goods to be respected. This is the
                            first step of direct treating with our government. So prepare for active
                            business by first of January.”</p>
                        <p>You submitted this information to her Majesty’s government with a request
                            on the part of the President of the United States that, if it should be
                            found to be correct, Mr. Bunch might be at once removed from his office.
                            And you further added, by my direction, that the President would
                            cheerfully accord an exequator to any person who might be appointed to
                            succeed Mr. Bunch, who would faithfully perform his functions without
                            injury to the rights and interests of the United States.</p>
                        <p>There is appended to your despatch now before me the written answer of
                            the Earl Russell to your note thus recited.</p>
                        <p>His lordship answers that he will, without hesitation, state to Mr. Adams
                            that, in pursuance of an agreement between the British and French
                            governments, Mr. Bunch was instructed to communicate to the persons
                            excercising authority in the so-called Confederate States the desire of
                            those governments that the second, third, and fourth articles of the
                            declaration of Paris should be observed by those States in the
                            prosecution of the hostilities in which they were engaged. His lordship
                            then asked you to observe that the commerce of Great Britain and France
                            is deeply interested in the maintenance of the articles providing that
                            the flag covers the goods, and that the goods of a neutral taken on
                            board a belligerent ship are not liable to confiscation. Earl Russell
                            thereupon proceeds to say that Mr. Bunch, in what he has done in this
                            matter, has acted in obedience to the instructions of his government,
                            who accept the responsibility of his proceedings, so far as they are
                            known to the foreign department, and who cannot therefore remove him
                            from his office for having obeyed their instructions. But his lordship
                            adds that, when it is stated in a letter from some person not named that
                            the first step to the recognition of the southern States by Great
                            Britain has been taken, he, Earl Russell, begs to decline all
                            responsibility for such statement; and he remarks on this branch of the
                            subject that her Majesty’s government have already recognized the
                            belligerent character of the southern States, and they will continue to
                            consider them as belligerents, but that her Majesty’s government have
                            not recognized, and are not prepared to recognize, the so-called
                            Confederate States as a separate and independent State.</p>
                        <p>You are instructed to reply to this note of her Majesty’s principal
                            secretary of state for foreign affairs:</p>
                        <p>First. That her Majesty’s government having avowed that Mr. Bunch acted
                            under their instructions, so far as his conduct is known to the foreign
                            department, and that government having avowed their responsibility for
                            his proceedings in that extent, it is admitted that, so far as that
                            portion of the subject is concerned, the matter is to be settled
                            directly with her Majesty’s government.</p>
                        <p>Secondly. That a law of the United States forbids any person not
                            specially appointed or duly authorized or recognized by the President,
                            whether citizen or denizen, privileged or unprivileged, from
                            counselling, advising, aiding, or assisting in any political
                            correspondence with the government of any foreign state whatever, with
                            an intent to influence the measures of any foreign government, or of any
                            officer or agent thereof, in relation to any disputes or controversies
                            with the United States, or to defeat the measures of the government. The
                            proceeding of Mr. Bunch was clearly and distinctly in violation of this
                            positive law.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly. This government finds no sufficient justification or excuse for
                            the proceeding of Mr. Bunch, thus shown to be in violation of the law of
                            the United States, in the consideration that Great Britain was deeply
                                <pb n="166" xml:id="pg_166" facs="0166"/> interested in the
                            maintenance of the articles which provide that the flag covers the
                            goods, and that the goods of a neutral taken on board a belligerent ship
                            are not liable to confiscation.</p>
                        <p>It is enough to say on this subject that, in our view, the proper agents
                            of the British government, to make known that interest here, are the
                            diplomatic, not the consular agents of her Majesty; and that the only
                            authority in this country to which any diplomatic communication whatever
                            can be made is the government of the United States itself.</p>
                        <p>Still less can the United States admit that communication by Mr. Bunch,
                            while exercising consular privileges with which he was clothed by the
                            consent of the United States, with insurgents in arms against the
                            federal government, is justified by the declaration of the British
                            ministry that they have already recognized the belligerent character of
                            the insurgents, and that they will continue to consider them as
                            belligerents. It is understood to be true that her Majesty’s government
                            have heretofore issued a royal proclamation which they interpret as
                            declaring that they recognize the insurgents as a belligerent. But it is
                            also true that this government has, with equal decision and with equal
                            resolution, announced to the British government that any such
                            declaration made by the British government would not be accepted as
                            modifying, in the least degree, the rights or powers of this government,
                            or the obligations due to them by Great Britain as a friendly nation.
                            Still adhering to this position, the government of the United States
                            will continue to pursue, as it has heretofore done, the counsels of
                            prudence, and will not suffer itself to be disturbed by excitement. It
                            must revoke the exequatur of the consul, who has not only been the
                            bearer of communications between the insurgents and a foreign
                            government, in violation of our laws, but has abused equally the
                            confidence of the two governments by reporting, without the authority of
                            his government, and in violation of their own policy as well as of our
                            national rights, that the proceeding in which he was engaged was in the
                            nature of a treaty with the insurgents, and the first step towards a
                            recognition by Great Britain of their sovereignty. Moreover, the conduct
                            of the person in question, even while this correspondence has been going
                            on, as well as before it commenced, has been that, not of a friend to
                            this government, or even of a neutral, but of a partisan of faction and
                            disunion.</p>
                        <p>In reviewing this subject it would be unjust to her Majesty’s minister
                            residing here, as well as to her Majesty’s government, to omit to say
                            that that minister has, in all his proceedings, carefully respected the
                            sovereignty and the rights of the United States, and that the
                            arrangements which have been made by him, with the approval of this
                            government, for communication between the British government and its
                            consuls, through the national vessels of Great Britain entering
                            blockaded ports without carrying passengers or private letters, seems to
                            forbid any necessity for a recurrence of such proceedings as those which
                            have brought about these explanations. You will inform the Earl Russell
                            that the exequatur of Mr. Bunch has been withdrawn because his services
                            as consul are not agreeable to this government, and that the consular
                            privileges thus taken from him will be cheerfully allowed to any
                            successor whom her Majesty may appoint, against whom no grave personal
                            objections shall exist. It is a source, of satisfaction to the President
                            to reflect that the proceeding which I have been considering occurred
                            some time ago, and that the part of it which was most calculated to
                            offend, and to which exception is now especially taken, finds no support
                            in the communication of Earl Russell.</p>
                        <p>I am, sir, your obedient servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your despatch of October 11, No. 58, has
                            been received. It is accompanied by Lord Russell’s reply to the note
                            which you addressed to him by my direction, asking an explanation of the
                            conduct of the colonial authorities in Trinidad on the occasion of the
                            entrance of the piratical vessel the “Sumter” into that port.</p>
                        <p>Lord Russell admits that the “Sumter,” (an armed American vessel) bearing
                            an insurgent flag, entered the port of Trinidad, and when boarded and
                            required to show her nationality, her commanding officer showed no legal
                            authority from this government, but a pretended commission from a
                            citizen of the United States, notoriously engaged in arms against them.
                            Notwithstanding these facts, it is not denied that the governor of the
                            island hoisted the British flag on the government flag-staff, although
                            it is stated by Lord Russell that, if he did so, it was probably done in
                            order to show the national character of the island, and not in
                            acknowledgment of the arrival of the “Sumter.”</p>
                        <p>His lordship, however, admits that the “Sumter” was allowed to remain six
                            days in Trinidad, and that during her stay she was allowed to supply
                            herself with coals and provisions. The armament, the insurgent flag, and
                            the spurious commission told the governor, as they sufficiently prove to
                            her Majesty’s government, that the “Sumter” is and can be nothing else
                            than a piratical vessel. Her depredations on the commerce of this
                            country form a part of the history of our times. The British government
                            has, moreover, been directly informed by us that the “Sumter” is a
                            piratical craft, and that the navigators and seamen on board of her are
                            pirates, punishable by the laws of their own country with death. Lord
                            Russell informs us that the law officers of the crown have nevertheless
                            reported that the conduct of the colonial authorities of Trinidad is in
                            conformity to her Majesty’s proclamation. Her Majesty’s government
                            dismiss our complaint from their consideration.</p>
                        <p>In view of these facts, it becomes my duty to instruct you to inform the
                            British government that the President deeply regrets that Lord Russell
                            is altogether unable to give to our complaint a satisfactory
                            solution.</p>
                        <p>When it is considered how important a part commerce plays among the
                            interests of our country, it will be seen that the United States cannot
                            consent that pirates engaged in destroying it shall receive shelter and
                            supplies in the ports of friendly nations. It tends to the universal
                            derangement of commerce when piracy is anywhere tolerated, and therefore
                            its suppression is a common interest of all civilized countries. But if
                            any one power fails to preserve this interest, and to act for the common
                            welfare, then it is easy to see that each state must provide for its own
                            security at whatever cost, and however it may disturb the general
                            harmony of the commercial world.</p>
                        <p>This government will consider how its safety may be best secured; but it
                            cannot forbear from expressing a hope that her Majesty’s ministers, in
                            view of the gravity of the question, may deem the subject worthy of a
                            deliberate reconsideration.</p>
                        <p>I am, sir, your most obedient servant,</p>

                            information has reached this department that foreign vessels-of-war,
                            which have entered ports of States in insurrection against the

                            instances, carried passengers, and in others private correspondence. It
                            is presumed that such proceedings could not have taken place with the

                            enter or depart from a blockaded port of the United States, will carry
                            any person as a passenger, or any correspondence other than that between
                            the government of the country to which the vessel may belong and the

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your note of the 4th instant, relative to communications
                            between ships-of-war and the ports in the southern States, now under
                            blockade.</p>
                        <p>You have apprised me in that note that information has reached the
                            Department of State that foreign vessels-of-war which have entered those
                            ports since they were blockaded, have in some instances carried
                            passengers, and in others private correspondence. You were so good as to
                            assure me verbally, yesterday, that no British ship-of-war was included
                            among those to which your note thus referred. Indeed, I have every
                            reason to believe that, with a single exception, no British ship-of-war
                            has communicated with any of the ports under blockade. The ship which I
                            except is the “Steady;” of my intention to request the commander of this
                            ship to leave official despatches at Charleston, I had the honor to
                            inform you on the 18th of last month. The “Steady” accordingly sailed
                            for Charleston a few days afterwards. She carried no letters except
                            official despatches from me or other authorities of foreign governments
                            in the United States, and no passenger excepting Mr. Fullaston, her
                            Majesty’s acting consul at Savannah, who was landed at Charleston on his
                            way back to his post.</p>
                        <p>As several of my colleagues have expressed to me their desire to send
                            official despatches to the consuls of their respective governments by
                            any of her Majesty’s ships which may hereafter convey despatches for me
                            to the ports under blockade, I shall be much obliged if you will inform
                            me whether you see any objection to my forwarding to those ports, by her
                            Majesty’s <pb n="169" xml:id="pg_169" facs="0169"/> ships, despatches

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Her Majesty’s government were much
                            concerned, to find that two British subjects, Mr. Patrick and Mr.
                            Rahming, had been subjected to arbitrary arrest; and although they had
                            learnt from a telegraphic despatch from me that Mr. Patrick had been
                            released, they could not but regard the matter as one requiring their
                            very serious consideration.</p>
                        <p>Her Majesty’s government perceive that when British subjects as well as
                            American citizens are arrested they are immediately transferred to a
                            military prison, and that the military authorities refuse to pay
                            obedience to a writ of habeas corpus.</p>
                        <p>Her Majesty’s government conceive that this practice is directly opposed
                            to the maxim of the Constitution of the United States “that no person
                            shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of
                            law.”</p>
                        <p>Her Majesty’s government are willing, however, to make every allowance
                            for the hard necessities of a time of internal trouble; and they would
                            not have been surprised if the ordinary securities of personal liberty
                            had been temporarily suspended, nor would they have complained if
                            British subjects falling under suspicion had suffered from the
                            consequences of that suspension.</p>
                        <p>But it does not appear that Congress has sanctioned in this respect any
                            departure from the due course of law; and it is in these circumstances
                            that the law officers of the crown have advised her Majesty’s government
                            that the arbitrary arrests of British subjects are illegal.</p>
                        <p>So far as appears to her Majesty’s government, the Secretary of State of
                            the United States exercises, upon the reports of spies and informers,
                            the power of depriving British subjects of their liberty, of retaining
                            them in prison, or liberating them, by his own will and pleasure.</p>
                        <p>Her Majesty’s government cannot but regard this despotic and arbitrary
                            power as inconsistent with the Constitution of the United States, as at
                            variance with the treaties of amity subsisting between the two nations,
                            and as tending to prevent the resort of British subjects to the United
                            States for the purposes of trade and industry.</p>
                        <p>Her Majesty’s government have therefore felt bound to instruct me to
                            remonstrate against such irregular proceedings, and to say that, in
                            their opinion, the authority of Congress is necessary in order to
                            justify the arbitrary arrest and imprisonment of British subjects.</p>

                            directly opposed to the maxim of the Constitution of the United States
                            that no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without
                            due process of law. You then observe that her Majesty’s government are
                            nevertheless willing to make every allowance for the hard necessities of
                            a time of internal trouble, and they would not have been surprised if
                            the ordinary securities of personal liberty had been temporarily
                            suspended, nor would they have complained if British subjects, falling
                            under suspicion, had suffered from the consequences of that suspension.
                            But that it does not appear that Congress has sanctioned, in this
                            respect, any departure from the due course of law, and it is in these
                            circumstances that the law officers of the crown have advised her
                            Majesty’s government that the arrests of British subjects are
                            illegal.</p>
                        <p>You remark further, that, so far as appears to her Majesty’s government,
                            the Secretary of State for the United States examines upon the reports
                            of spies, and assumes the power of depriving British subjects of their
                            liberty or liberating them by his own will and pleasure; and you inform
                            me that her Majesty’s government cannot but regard this despotic and
                            arbitrary power as inconsistent with the Constitution of the United
                            States, as at variance with the treaties of amity subsisting between the
                            two nations, and as tending to prevent the resort of British subjects to
                            the United States for purposes of trade and industry. You conclude with
                            informing me that upon these grounds her Majesty’s government have felt
                            bound to instruct you to remonstrate against such irregular proceedings,
                            and to say that, in their opinion, the authority of Congress is
                            necessary in order to justify the arbitrary arrest and imprisonment of
                            British subjects.</p>
                        <p>The facts in regard to the two persons named in your note are as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p>Communications from the regular police of the country to the Executive at
                            Washington showed that disloyal persons in the State of Alabama were
                            conducting treasonable correspondence with confederates, British
                            subjects and American citizens, in Europe, aimed at the overthrow of the
                            federal Union by armed forces actually in the field, and besieging the
                            capital of the United States. A portion of this correspondence which was
                            intercepted was addressed to the, firm of Smith &amp; Patrick, brokers,
                            long established and doing business in the city of New York. It appeared
                            that this firm had a branch at Mobile; that the partner, Smith, is a
                            disloyal citizen of the United States, and that he was in Europe when
                            the treasonable papers were sent from Mobile, addressed through the
                            house of Smith &amp; Patrick, in New York. On receiving this information
                            William Patrick was arrested and committed <pb n="171" xml:id="pg_171"
                                facs="0171"/> into military custody at Fort Lafayette by an order of
                            the Secretary of War of the United States, addressed to the police of
                            the city of New York. These proceedings took place on the 28th of August
                            last.</p>
                        <p>Representations were thereupon made to the Secretary of State by friends
                            of Mr. Patrick to the effect that notwithstanding his associations he
                            was personally loyal to this government, and that he was ignorant of the
                            treasonable nature of the correspondence which was being carried on
                            through the mercantile house of which he was a member. Directions were
                            thereupon given by the Secretary of State to a proper agent to inquire
                            into the correctness of the facts thus presented, and this inquiry
                            resulted in the establishment of their truth. Mr. William Patrick was
                            thereupon promptly released from custody by direction of the Secretary
                            of State. This release occurred on the thirteenth day of September
                            last.</p>
                        <p>On the second day of September the superintendent of police in the city
                            of New York informed the Secretary of State, by telegraph, that he had
                            under arrest J. C. Rahming, who had just arrived from Nassau, where he
                            had attempted to induce the owners of the schooner “Arctic” to take
                            cannon to Wilmington, in North Carolina, for the use of the rebels, and
                            inquired what should he do with the prisoner. J. C. Rahming was
                            thereupon committed into military custody at Fort Lafayette under a
                            mandate from the Secretary of State. This commitment was made on the
                            second day of September. On the 17th day of that month this prisoner,
                            after due inquiry, was released from custody on his executing a bond in
                            the penalty of two thousand five hundred dollars, with a condition that
                            he should thereafter bear true allegiance to the United States, and do
                            no act hostile or injurious to them while remaining under their
                            protection.</p>
                        <p>I have to regret that, after so long an official intercourse between the
                            governments of the United States and Great Britain, it should be
                            necessary now to inform her Majesty’s ministers that all executive
                            proceedings, whether of the Secretary of War or of the Secretary of
                            State, are, unless disavowed or revoked by the President, proceedings of
                            the President of the United States.</p>
                        <p>Certainly it is not necessary to announce to the British government now
                            that an insurrection, attended by civil and even social war, was
                            existing in the United States when the proceedings which I have thus
                            related took place. But it does seem necessary to state, for the
                            information of that government, that Congress is, by the Constitution,
                            invested with no executive power or responsibility whatever; and, on the
                            contrary, that the President of the United States is, by the
                            Constitution and laws, invested with the whole executive power of the
                            government, and charged with the supreme direction of all municipal or
                            ministerial civil agents, as well as of the whole land and naval forces
                            of the Union; and that, invested with those ample powers, he is charged
                            by the Constitution and laws with the absolute duty of suppressing
                            insurrection as well as of preventing and repelling invasion; and that
                            for these purposes he constitutionally exercises the right of suspending
                            the writ of <hi rend="italic">habeas corpus</hi> whenever and
                            wheresoever and in whatsoever extent the public safety, endangered by
                            treason or invasion in arms, in his judgment requires.</p>
                        <p>The proceedings of which the British government complain were taken upon
                            information conveyed to the President by legal police authorities of the
                            country, and they were not instituted until after he had suspended the
                            great writ of freedom in just the extent that, in view of the perils of
                            the State, he deemed necessary. For the exercise of that discretion he,
                            as well as his advisers, among whom are the Secretary of War and the
                            Secretary of State, is responsible by law before the highest judicial
                            tribunal of the republic, and amenable also to the judgment of his
                            countrymen and the enlightened opinion of the civilized world.</p>
                        <pb n="172" xml:id="pg_172" facs="0172"/>
                        <p>A candid admission contained in your letter relieves me of any necessity
                            for showing that the two persons named therein were neither known nor
                            supposed to be British subjects when the proceedings occurred, and that
                            in every case subjects of her Majesty residing in the United States, and
                            under their protection, are treated during the present troubles in the
                            same manner and with no greater or less rigor than American
                            citizens.</p>
                        <p>The military prison which was used for the temporary detention of the
                            suspected parties is a fort constructed and garrisoned for the public
                            defence. The military officer charged with their custody has declined to
                            pay obedience to the writ of habeas corpus, but the refusal was made in
                            obedience to an express direction of the President, in the exercise of
                            his functions as commander-in-chief of all the land and naval forces of
                            the United States. Although it is not very important, it certainly is
                            not entirely irrelevant to add that, so far as I am informed, no writ of
                            habeas corpus was attempted to be served, or was even sued out or
                            applied for in behalf of either of the persons named; although in a case
                            not dissimilar the writ of habeas corpus was issued out in favor of
                            another British subject, and was disobeyed by direction of the
                            President.</p>
                        <p>The British government have candidly conceded, in the remonstrance before
                            me, that even in this country, so remarkable for so long an enjoyment,
                            by its people of the highest immunities of personal freedom, war, and
                            especially civil war, cannot be conducted exclusively in the forms and
                            with the dilatory remedies provided by municipal laws which are adequate
                            to the preservation of public order in a time of peace. Treason always
                            operates, if possible, by surprise, and prudence and humanity therefore
                            equally require that violence concocted in secret shall be prevented if
                            practicable by unusual and vigorous precaution. I am fully aware of the
                            inconveniences which result from the practice of such precaution,
                            embarrassing communities in social life, and affecting perhaps trade and
                            intercourse with foreign nations. But the American people, after having
                            tried in every way to avert civil war, have accepted it at last as a
                            stern necessity. Their chief interest, while it lasts, is not the
                            enjoyments of society, or the profits of trade, but the saving of the
                            national life. That life saved, all the other blessings which attach to
                            it will speedily return, with greater assurance of continuance than ever
                            before. The safety of the whole people has become, in the present
                            emergency, the supreme law, and so long as the danger shall exist, all
                            classes of society equally, the denizen and the citizen, cheerfully
                            acquiesce in the measures which that law prescribes.</p>
                        <p>This government does not question the learning of the legal advisers of
                            the British crown or the justice of the deference which her Majesty’s
                            government pays to them. Nevertheless the British government will hardly
                            expect that the President will accept their explanations of the
                            Constitution of the United States, especially when the Constitution,
                            thus expounded, would leave upon him the sole executive responsibility
                            of suppressing the existing insurrection, while it would transfer to
                            Congress the most material and indispensable power to be employed for
                            that purpose. Moreover, these explanations find no real support in the
                            letter, much less in the spirit, of the Constitution itself. He must be
                            allowed, therefore, to prefer and be governed by the view of our organic
                            national law, which, while it will enable him to execute his great trust
                            with complete success, receives the sanction of the highest authorities
                            of our own country, and is sustained by the general consent of the
                            people, for whom alone that Constitution was established.</p>
                        <p>I avail myself of this opportunity to offer to your lordship a renewed
                            assurance of my very high consideration.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Lord</hi>: I have had the honor to receive your
                            note of the 12th instant in answer to mine of the 4th, relative to the
                            carriage of passengers and private letters in vessels of war of foreign
                            powers to and from ports of the United States under blockade.</p>
                        <p>In reply, I have the honor to acquaint you that no complaint has been
                            made to this department that any British vessel had indulged in this
                            practice; but insomuch as such a proceeding, if acquiesced in at all by
                            this government, would defeat the objects of the blockade, it was deemed
                            advisable to address a circular upon the subject to the representatives
                            here of the principal maritime powers. No objection is entertained to

                            commencement of the blockade, with a view to avoid any future

                            thus interpreted by the judge, will be expected to be strictly observed
                            by all vessels in ports of insurgent States during their blockade by the

                                this city, and sent to him. General Dix replied very briefly that he

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Lord</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your note of yesterday, requesting information in regard to a
                            bag supposed to contain despatches from the acting British consul at
                            Richmond, addressed to Mr. Archibald, the British consul at New York,
                            which bag was taken from a man named Cross by the provost marshal of
                            Baltimore.</p>
                        <p>In reply, I have the honor to inform you that having received information
                            from General Dix that such a bag had been found concealed in the trunk
                            of a man of that name—a spy of the insurgents, who escaped before he
                            could be arrested—I directed the general to forward it hither. On its
                            arrival, although it had a label attached to it, addressed to Mr.
                            Archibald, and the words on her Britannic Majesty’s service, there was
                            nothing to identify it as having been forwarded by the British
                            vice-consul at Richmond. This circumstance, in connexion with those
                            under which the bag was brought through the military lines of the United
                            States, naturally occasioned doubts as to its containing official
                            correspondence. I consequently directed the bag to be opened, when it
                            proved to contain not a single communication for Mr. Archibald, or for
                            any other officer of the British government on this continent. It did
                            contain a few apparently official letters to functionaries of the
                            British government at London. These were promptly forwarded, as
                            received, to Mr. Adams, with directions to cause them to be delivered to
                            their address.</p>
                        <p>The other contents of the bag are, and will be, retained here. It is
                            unnecessary to specify their character. I will only add that they are
                            such as no consul, or acting consul, of a foreign government has a right
                            to forward in any way from a place in rebellion against this

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Her Majesty’s government have had under
                            their consideration the note which I had the honor to address to you on
                            the 22d ultimo, with the despatch from Mr. Consul Archibald which
                            accompanied it.</p>
                        <pb n="176" xml:id="pg_176" facs="0176"/>
                        <p>Her Majesty’s government have learned with much surprise, from those
                            papers, the cruel treatment to which the nine British seamen who were
                            imprisoned in Fort Lafayette were subjected by the United States
                            authorities. Her Majesty’s government are unable to comprehend the
                            grounds on which persons, who were accused of no offence, were confined
                            in irons and treated as criminals; and although it has been satisfactory
                            to them to learn, from the answer which you did me the honor to make to
                            my representations on the subject, that orders were given for the
                            release of these men, yet her Majesty’s government cannot but consider
                            that some amends are due to them for the sufferings to which they were
                            thus causelessly exposed. Her Majesty’s government have accordingly
                            instructed me to bring the matter again to the notice of the government
                            of the United States, and to express their hope that due compensation
                            may be awarded to the sufferers.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The case in regard to pirates engages by
                            the insurgents in this country practically stands thus: every naval
                            power, and every commercial power except one, practically excludes them
                            from, their ports, except in distress, or for a visit of any kind longer
                            than twenty-four hours, and from supplies, except of coals, for
                            twenty-four hour’s consumption.</p>
                        <p>Great Britain, as we are given to understand by the answer of Earl
                            Russell, allows these pirates to visit her ports and stay at their own
                            pleasure, receiving supplies without restriction.</p>
                        <p>We find it difficult to believe that the government of Great Britain has
                            constituted this exception with full deliberation. I intimated in a
                            preceding despatch, No. 112, a hope that the subject might be
                            reconsidered before it should be necessary for us to consider what
                            remedies we can adopt to prevent the evils which must result to our
                            commerce from the policy thus indicated by Great Britain. I have
                            consulted on the subject with Lord Lyons, and he may perhaps communicate
                            with his government thereupon. Meantime, I am directed by the President
                            to instruct you to recall the attention of her Majesty’s government to
                            the question, under the influences of a spirit of peace and friendship,
                            and with a desire to preserve what remains of a commerce mutually
                            important to both countries.</p>

                                    loss I have sustained by the detention of my ship, and which
                                    loss I estimate at the sum of two hundred pounds sterling,
                                    besides rendering void all insurances effected upon the ship,
                                    her cargo and freight, (of the gross Value of forty thousand
                                    pounds sterling,) by compelling the ship to deviate from her
                                    voyage.</p>
                                <p>The “Perthshire,” a ship of 810 tons register, was chartered by a
                                    merchant in Liverpool, in March last, to proceed in ballast from
                                    Grimsby to Pensacola, and there load a cargo of timber for the
                                    United Kingdom; the charterer, however, having the option,
                                    through his agent at Pensacola, of ordering the ship to Mobile
                                    to load cotton for Liverpool at a lump sum of £2,300.</p>
                                <p>The ship sailed from Grimsby in March last, and on the 13th of
                                    May was making for the harbor of Pensacola, when she was ordered
                                    to heave to by the commander of the United States steamship
                                    “Niagara.” She was boarded by Lieutenant Brown, boarding
                                    officer, who informed Captain Oates, of the “Perthshire,” that
                                    Pensacola was blockaded, and indorsed the vessel’s register as

                                <p>In reply to the inquiry of Captain Oates, the lieutenant informed
                                    him that Mobile was not blockaded. The ship then proceeded to
                                    Mobile, where she arrived on the 14th May. Mobile was not
                                    blockaded until May 26. At Mobile the “Perthshire” loaded a
                                    cargo of cotton for Liverpool, and proceeded to sea on May 31;
                                    outside the port she was again boarded by the boarding officer
                                    of the United States steamship “Niagara,” who examined his [her]
                                    clearances, expressed himself satisfied with them, and said the
                                    ship might proceed on her voyage. She proceeded with light and
                                    variable winds until the 9th of June, when she was boarded by
                                    the boarding officer of the United States ship “Massachusetts,”
                                    who, after communicating with his ship, sent a prize crew of 29
                                    men and 2 officers on board the “Perthshire,” who took
                                    possession of the ship and all the captain’s papers, hauled down
                                    the British flag and hoisted the United States flag. They
                                    altered the course of the ship, and took her back towards
                                    Pensacola, off which place, on the 12th of June, after sailing
                                    about 200 miles back, they fell in with the United States

                                <p>Such, my lord, is a plain, unvarnished statement of the facts
                                    connected with this extraordinary seizure and detention. The
                                    ship having reached her destination safely prevents a discussion
                                    as to liability in the event of loss after the deviation in the
                                    voyage, but which the Liverpool underwriters say they would have
                                    been exempted from had such taken place.</p>
                                <p>The ground upon which I base my claim for £200 is as follows: The
                                    ship had been nine days at sea when she was seized. She was
                                    taken back almost to the place from which she first started, and
                                    three days after that (or twelve, days from leaving Mobile) she
                                    was as far from Liverpool as on the 31st of May, when she sailed
                                    from Mobile. Her freight was about £550 per month, and twelve
                                    days at that rate is about the sum I claim.</p>
                                <p>The case of the “Perthshire,” my lord, has been commented upon by
                                    ail the leading journals in Great Britain, and without exception
                                    they pronounce it a case in which our government ought to make a
                                    demand for damages. I venture to hope, therefore, that your
                                    lordship will take such steps with regard to this matter as will
                                    prevent a repetition of improper interference with British
                                    ships, and at the same time obtain for me the reasonable and
                                    fair compensation I claim.</p>

                                <p>The English ship “Perthshire,” Captain James Oates, left the
                                    harbor of Mobile on the 30th of June, 1861, and was boarded by
                                    Lieutenant Spicer, from this ship, and passed by my order, the
                                    fifteen days allowed by the proclamation of the President of the
                                    United States for neutral vessels to depart not having
                                    expired.</p>
                                <p>I am under the impression that no indorsement was made upon her
                                    register, as I did not consider it necessary.</p>
                                <p>I arrived off Fort Pickens in the Niagara early on the morning of
                                    the 12th of June, 1861. A large ship, which proved to be the
                                    “Perthshire,” had just anchored.</p>
                                <p>Immediately after the Niagara had come to anchor, Commander M.
                                    Smith, commanding the United States steamer Massachusetts, came
                                    on board and reported having captured the Perthshire in latitude
                                    27° 27′ and longitude 85° 31′.</p>
                                <p>I stated to Commander Smith that the Perthshire had left Mobile
                                    within the time allowed by the President’s proclamation; that I
                                    considered the capture illegal, as, by order of the department,
                                    no neutral vessel not having on board contraband of war, was to
                                    be detained or captured unless attempting to leave or enter a
                                    blockaded port after the notification of blockade had been
                                    indorsed on her register. I therefore directed him to release
                                    the “Perthshire,” and to replace such provisions and stores as
                                    might have been used by the prize crew.</p>
                                <p>She was accordingly released and immediately got under way,
                                    Commander Smith having reported to me that he had not only
                                    replaced such provisions as had been used, but had also supplied
                                    her with water.</p>
                                <p>I subsequently received from Captain Adams the report of
                                    Commander Smith, a copy of which is herewith submitted. It bears
                                    no date.</p>
                                <p>As I was in hourly expectation of your arrival from Key West, I
                                    had fully intended reporting the circumstances to you, but it
                                    escaped my memory.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Lord</hi>: Your letter of the 11th of October
                                last, presenting the claim of Mr. William Gray, owner of the British
                                ship “Perthshire,” for damages incurred by the detention of that
                                vessel by the blockading squadron of the United States, was referred
                                by me to the Secretary of the Navy for information upon the
                                subject.</p>
                            <p>I have now received the answer of the Secretary of the Navy
                                thereupon, which fails to show me that the detention of the
                                Perthshire by Commander Smith, commanding the United States steamer
                                Massachusetts, was warranted by law or by the President’s
                                proclamation instituting the blockade, although I am satisfied that
                                that officer acted under a misapprehension of his duties, and not
                                from any improper motive. It will belong to Congress to appropriate
                                the sum of two hundred pounds, claimed by Gray, which sum seems to
                                me not an unreasonable one. The President will ask Congress for that
                                appropriation as soon as they shall meet, and he will direct that
                                such instructions shall be given to Commander Smith as will caution
                                him against a repetition of the errors of which you have
                                complained.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: It seems to me that our mission to Austria
                            has not been made as useful hitherto as it ought to have been. I think,
                            indeed, that it has generally been undervalued. The causes for this are
                            manifest. We are a commercial people, and of course cultivate
                            acquaintance first and chiefly with other commercial nations. Situated
                            on a long Atlantic coast, and confronting on the opposite shore the
                            commercial countries from whence our population was first and
                            principally derived, we have naturally fallen into relations with them
                            of the most intimate kind. Austria is distant, and it has never been a
                            maritime nation.</p>
                        <p>To go no further in the review of its history than 1815, the Austrian
                            government has been that one of the great European powers which has
                            maintained more studiously, firmly, and persistently than any other, the
                            principles of unlimited monarchy, so opposite in their character to the
                            principles upon which our own government has been, established.</p>
                        <p>Again, Austria is not an unique country with a homogeneous people. It is
                            a combination of kingdoms, duchies, provinces, and countries, added to
                            each other by force, and subjected to an imperial head, but remaining at
                            the same time diverse, distinct, and discordant. The empire is therefore
                            largely destitute of that element of nationality which is essential to
                            the establishment of free intercourse with remote foreign States. This
                            absence of nationality is observable in the Austrian emigration to the
                            United States. We meet everywhere here, in town and country, Italians,
                            Hungarians, Poles, Magyars, Jews, and Germans, who have come to us from
                            that empire, but no one has ever seen a confessed Austrain among us. So
                            when a traveller visits Austria he passes through distinctly marked
                            countries, whose people call themselves by many different names, but
                            none of them indicative of their relation to the empire.</p>
                        <p>Our representatives at Vienna seem generally to have come, after a short
                            residence there, to the conclusion that there was nothing for them to do
                            and little for them to learn. * * * * *</p>
                        <p>The President expects that you will be diligent in obtaining not only
                            information about political events, but also commercial and even
                            scientific facts, and in reporting them to this department. Austria is
                            an interesting field for improvement of that kind. Although Lombardy,
                            with other Italian provinces, has recently been lost, yet the empire
                            still has a population little inferior in number to our own; and though
                            there are some nations whose people are more mercurial, there is no one
                            in the whole world whose inhabitants are more industrious, frugal,
                            cheerful, and comfortable; none in which agriculture derives more wealth
                            from hard soils and ungenial skies; none where science, art, and taste
                            mingle so perfectly with public and private economy. An undue portion of
                            the country is mountainous. It has nevertheless <pb n="184"
                                xml:id="pg_184" facs="0184"/> a richness and variety of mineral and
                            vegetable wealth unequalled in any other part of Europe. Many of its
                            productions could, if introduced more freely, find a ready consumption
                            here, while, on the other hand, we could supply Austria with materials
                            and provisions which are now at greater cost received by her from other
                            countries. Many of the Austrian productions and fabrics which we do
                            receive come to us through the hands of merchants in other European
                            States.</p>
                        <p>The insignificance of our commerce with Austria results in a large degree
                            from her policy of taxing exports as well as imports, and from
                            monopolies, by which she labors to create a national system of
                            navigation. The subject is one of great interest, and you can render an
                            important service probably to both countries by applying yourself to an
                            examination of it with a view to the negotiation of a more liberal
                            treaty than the one now in force.</p>
                        <p>Just now a pressure upon this department, incidental to the beginning of
                            a new administration, renders it impossible for me to descend into the
                            details which must be considered in this connexion. It is, however, a
                            purpose of the President that the subject shall be thoroughly
                            investigated, and you will in due time be fully instructed. In the
                            meanwhile you are authorized to communicate his disposition in this
                            respect to the government of his Imperial Royal Majesty, and to
                            ascertain, if possible, whether it would be willing to enter into a
                            revision of the commercial arrangements now existing between the two
                            nations.</p>
                        <p>The President is well aware that the government of Austria is naturally
                            pre-occupied with political questions of great moment. It must be
                            confessed, also, that painful events occurring among ourselves have a
                            tendency to withdraw our thoughts from commercial subjects. But it is
                            not to be doubted, in the first place, that political embarrassments
                            would in both countries be essentially relieved by any improvement of
                            their commerce which could be made; and, secondly, that the greater
                            those embarrassments are the more merit there will be in surmounting
                            them so far as may be necessary to effect that improvement. It certainly
                            is not the intention of the President that the progress in material and
                            social improvement which this country has been making through so many
                            years shall be arrested or hindered unnecessarily by the peculiar
                            political trials to which it seems likely to be subjected during the
                            term for which he has been called to conduct the administration of its
                            affairs.</p>
                        <p>There is a peculiar fitness in efforts at this time to enlarge our trade
                            in the Mediterranean, for it is never wise to neglect advantages which
                            can be secured with small expense, and near at home, while prosecuting
                            at great cost, as we are doing, great enterprises in remoter parts of
                            the world. I would not overlook Italy, Germany, and Hungary, while
                            reaching forth for the trade of China and Japan.</p>
                        <p>I shall allude to political affairs in Austria only so far as is
                            necessary to enable me to indicate the policy which the President will
                            pursue in regard to them. They present to us the aspect of an ancient
                            and very influential power, oppressed with fiscal embarrassments, the
                            legacy of long and exhausting wars, putting forth at one and the same
                            time efforts for material improvement, and still mightier ones to
                            protect its imperfectly combined dominion from dismemberment and
                            disintegration, seriously menaced from without, aided by strong and
                            intense popular passions within. With these questions the government of
                            the United States has and can have no concern. In the intercourse of
                            nations each must be assumed by every other to choose and will what it
                            maintains, tolerates, or allows. Any other than a course of neutrality
                            would tend to keep human society continually embroiled in wars, and
                            render national independence everywhere practically impossible. <pb
                                n="185" xml:id="pg_185" facs="0185"/> No institutions which can be
                            established in a country through foreign intervention can give to it
                            security or other advantages equal to those which are afforded by the
                            system it establishes or permits for itself; while every nation must be
                            regarded as a moral person, and so amenable to the public opinion of
                            mankind, that opinion can carry its decrees into effect only by peaceful
                            means and influences. These principles, hitherto practiced by the United
                            States with great impartiality, furnish rules for the conduct of their
                            representatives abroad, and especially for your own in the critical
                            condition of political affairs in the country to which you are
                            accredited.</p>
                        <p>This intimation is given so distinctly because an observance of it is
                            peculiarly important in the present condition of our domestic affairs.
                            We are just entering on a fearful trial, hitherto not only unknown, but
                            even deemed impossible by all who have not been supposed to regard the
                            career of our country, even under auspicious indications, with morbid
                            distrust.</p>
                        <p>Ambitious and discontented partisans have raised the standard of
                            insurrection and organized in form a revolutionary government. Their
                            agents have gone abroad to seek, under the name of recognition, aid and
                            assistance. In this case imprudence on our part in our intercourse with
                            foreign nations might provoke injurious, possibly dangerous,
                            retaliation.</p>
                        <p>The President does not by any means apprehend that the imperial royal
                            government at Vienna will be inclined to listen to those overtures. The
                            habitual forbearance of his Majesty, the friendship which happily has
                            always existed between the two countries, and the prudence which the
                            government of the former has so long practiced in regard to political
                            affairs on this continent, forbid any such apprehension.</p>
                        <p>Should our confidence in this respect, however, prove to be erroneous,
                            the remarks which I shall have occasion to make with a different view in
                            this paper will furnish you with the grounds on which to stand while
                            resisting and opposing any such application of the so-called Confederate
                            States of America.</p>
                        <p>Vienna, as you are very well aware, is a political centre in continental
                            Europe. You may expect to meet agents of disunion there seeking to mould
                            public opinion for effect elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>I will not detain you with a history of that reckless movement, or with
                            details of the President’s policy in regard to it. Your experience as a
                            prominent member of Congress has already furnished the former. The
                            inaugural address of the President, with despatches to your predecessor,
                            will be found in the archives of the legation, and will supply the
                            latter.</p>
                        <p>Certainly I shall not need to anticipate and controvert any complaints of
                            injustice, oppression, or wrong, which those agents may prefer against
                            their country before foreign tribunals. Practically, the discontented
                            party itself administered this government from the earliest day when
                            sedition began its incubation until the insurgents had risen and
                            organized their new provisional and revolutionary government. Never, in
                            the history of the human race, has revolution been so altogether without
                            cause, or met with forbearance, patience, and gentleness so long.</p>
                        <p>Nor shall I notice particularly the apprehensions of future injustice and
                            oppression which, in the absence of real cause, are put forth as grouuds
                            for the insurrection. The revolutionists will find it very hard to make
                            any European sovereign, or even any European subject, understand what
                            better or further guarantee they could have of all their rights of
                            person and property than those which are written in the Constitution of
                            the United States, and which have never been by the government of the
                            United States broken or violated either in letter or in spirit. They
                            will find it quite as difficult to make either a European sovereign or
                            subject understand how they can reasonably <pb n="186" xml:id="pg_186"
                                facs="0186"/> expect to improve their political security by
                            organizing a new government under a constitution containing
                            substantially the same provisions as the one they seek to overthrow.</p>
                        <p>There is reason to apprehend that the form of argument which the agents
                            alluded to will chiefly employ will be an assumption that the
                            independence and sovereignty of the new and irregular authority they
                            represent is already <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> established.</p>
                        <p>If this were true, still you could reply that no public interest of other
                            States, nor even any such interest of the new confederacy itself could
                            suffer by a delay allowing sufficient time for the government of the
                            United States, fully consulting the people, to acknowledge in the first
                            instance the independence so claimed to have been established. The
                            United States have a right to require such delay from all friendly
                            powers, and a refusal of it would be an act offensive to their dignity
                            and manifestly hostile. There is not the least ground to assume that the
                            government of the United States would act otherwise, than wisely,
                            discreetly, and humanely, when it should come to act in such a case.
                            Individual caprice finds no place in a government so entirely popular as
                            ours, and partisan excitement sinks in great national emergencies here
                            before the calm considerate judgment of the American people pronouncing
                            upon considerations exclusively of their own security, freedom, and
                            happiness. They would, indeed, regard the effectual dismemberment of the
                            Union as fatal to the highest hopes which humanity has ever, with
                            apparent reason, indulged. But they are not visionary nor impracticable,
                            and they will not lack even the magnanimity to accept the fact of their
                            ruin, and govern themselves in conformity with it, before other nations
                            fraternally disposed need to intervene to reconcile them, or, if
                            unfriendly, to profit by that last calamity.</p>
                        <p>At all events foreign governments may be expected to consult their own
                            interests and welfare in regard to the subject in question, even though
                            indifferent to the rights and interests of the United States. A
                            premature declaration of recognition by any foreign State would be
                            direct intervention, and the State which should lend it must be prepared
                            to assume the relations of an ally of the projected confederacy and
                            employ force to render the recognition effectual.</p>
                        <p>But, in point of fact, the assumption that the new confederacy has
                            established its sovereignty and independence is altogether unfounded. It
                            was projected, or favored, by the late administration during the four
                            months that it remained in power after the election, which constituted
                            practically an interregnum. The new administration, now only forty days
                            old, has practiced forbearance and conciliation, relying hitherto, as it
                            will hereafter rely, on the virtue and patriotism of the people to
                            rescue the country and the Union from danger by peaceful and
                            constitutional means, and content to maintain the authority and defend
                            the positions which came into, its hands on the fourth of March last,
                            without employing coercion, so unnatural, and, as it has hitherto
                            believed and still believes, so unnecessary for the national security,
                            integrity, and welfare. The so-called confederacy has yet to secure its
                            sovereignty either by war or by peace. If it shall, as now seems
                            probable, have determined on war, it has only just thrown down the
                            challenge. It must not assume that a nation so sound, so vigorous, and
                            so strong as this, although it may forbear long, will not accept such a
                            challenge when there is no alternative.</p>
                        <p>The government of the so-called Confederate States have still greater
                            perils to incur if they are to establish their separation by the acts
                            and processes proper for peace. They will have at some time to refer
                            themselves and all their action to an intelligent people, who will then
                            have had time to reflect and to inquire what all this revolution is for,
                            and what good it <pb n="187" xml:id="pg_187" facs="0187"/> can produce.
                            They will have to satisfy that people and mankind that a republican
                            government can be stable and permanent which is built on the principle
                            that a minority, when defeated in the popular elections, may appeal to
                            arms, and that a confederacy can be relied upon by creditors or nations
                            that admits the right of each of its members to withdraw from it and
                            cast off its obligations at pleasure.</p>
                        <p>I have treated the subject as if it were a question of war or of peace in
                            the election of the insurrectionists. But, in truth, both the justice
                            and the wisdom of the war must in the end be settled, as all questions
                            which concern the American people must be determined, not by arms, but
                            by suffrage. When, at last, the ballot is to be employed after the
                            sword, then, in addition to the pregnant questions I have indicated, two
                            further ones will arise requiring to be answered, namely, which party
                            began the conflict, and which maintained in that conflict the cause of
                            freedom and humanity.</p>
                        <p>The agents of the projected confederacy have hitherto affected to
                            undervalue the power which the Union can exercise for self-preservation,
                            and they may attempt to mislead foreign States on this subject. It is
                            true that the government was powerless to resist them so long as it was
                            practically in their own hands and managed to favor their designs. Its
                            executive department was panic-stricken, its legislature divided and
                            distracted, its army demoralized and betrayed, its fortifications
                            virtually surrendered, its navy dispersed, and its credit prostrated.
                            Even the people themselves were bewildered by the sudden appearance of
                            such unlooked-for and appalling dangers. All this demoralization is
                            passing away as rapidly as it came on; and it will soon appear in this,
                            as in all other cases, that the greatest vigor is found combined with
                            the greatest power of elasticity. It will be deeply to be regretted if
                            the energy of this great government is to have its first serious trial
                            in a civil war, instead of one against a foreign foe. But if that trial
                            cannot be averted, it will be seen that resources prudently left
                            unembarrassed are more available than credit in foreign markets; that
                            the loyalty of a brave and free people is more reliable than standing
                            armies; that a good cause is worth more than allies, and self-defence is
                            an attribute stronger than fortresses. Its assailants will have to
                            defend themselves before an enlightened people, and even before other
                            nations, at least so far as to show one State that the federal Union has
                            actually oppressed or menaced, or one citizen who fared the worse for
                            having lived under its authority.</p>
                        <p>The agents of the new confederacy it is supposed will offer more
                            favorable conditions to foreign commerce than the United States have
                            thought it wise to afford. Such offers may be met with a few direct
                            propositions. The sagacity of the federal government is not likely to be
                            found long at fault in giving such advantages to the insurrectionists.
                            In the second place, how is a revolution to be carried on without taxes?
                            Are the so-called seceding States abler than their sister States to
                            endure direct taxation, or will faction reconcile men to burdens that
                            patriotism finds intolerable? It will be well for the so-called
                            confederacy if, instead of making good the promises in this respect made
                            in its name, it do not find itself obliged to levy duties as large as
                            those of the federal government on imports, and to add to its revenue
                            system, what that government never has done, the ruinous feature of
                            taxation upon exports. It is easily seen how little such a financial
                            policy will commend the new government to the favor of European
                            politicians and capitalists.</p>
                        <p>But I must draw these instructions to a close. You will on all occasions
                            represent that the interests of Europe and of mankind demand peace, and
                            especially peace on this continent. The Union is the only guarantee of
                            peace. Intervention would be war, and disunion would be only endless
                            war.</p>
                        <pb n="188" xml:id="pg_188" facs="0188"/>
                        <p>The Union is, moreover, the chief security for the stability of nations.
                            When this experiment of self-government shall have failed for want of
                            wisdom and virtue enough, either at home or abroad, to, preserve it or
                            permit it to exist, the people of other countries may well despair and
                            lose the patience they have practiced so long under different systems in
                            the expectation that the influence it was slowly exercising would
                            ultimately bring them to the enjoyment of the rights of self-government.
                            When that patience disappears, anarchy must come upon the earth.</p>

                            receipt of your circular, dated the 9th of March, 1861.</p>
                        <p>I presented the copy of the inaugural address of the President to Count
                            Rechberg on the 8th day of April, and at the same time verbally
                            communicated, in accordance with the instructions, contained in said
                            despatch, the views and opinions of my government on the present
                            disturbed condition of its domestic affairs, and the aspect in which it
                            wished them to be regarded by the government of Austria.</p>
                        <p>He replied that Austria hoped to see us re-united. That she was not
                            inclined to recognize <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> governments
                            anywhere; her opinions bad been made, however, and her minister and
                            consuls in America instructed fully on the subject; that no application
                            had yet been made to Austria for recognition as an independent
                            sovereignty, by any portion of the confederacy of the United States, and
                            he was of opinion that, as the views of Austria would soon be known on
                            the subject, no such application would be made. Should it be otherwise,
                            however, he would notify this legation and the subject could be

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: A few days since Count Rechberg, the
                            imperial royal minister of foreign affairs, was interrogated in the
                            house of deputies of the Austrian empire on the subject of the course
                            pursued, or about to be pursued, by the imperial royal government in
                            relation to American affairs in the present complication. The report of
                            his remarks is as follows:</p>
                        <pb n="189" xml:id="pg_189" facs="0189"/>
                        <p>Count Rechberg rose to answer the question, “What measures has the
                            government taken to protect its commercial relations with the United
                            States of North America, under the warlike condition of things, now
                            existing there,” put by Mr. Putzer and his associates. He said: “The
                            minister of foreign affairs has, in connexion with the ministers of
                            trade and the navy, caused information to be obtained through the
                            imperial minister resident at Washington as to the measures which other
                            governments have taken for the, same reason. The answer received was,
                            that England and France, as well as Holland, had strengthened their
                            squadrons in the American waters, and had endeavored to bring the
                            belligerent powers to the recognition of those principles, especially
                            relating to the protection of private property, which were agreed upon
                            at the congress of Paris in 1856. The imperial government has, for the
                            present, abstained from sending ships-of-war, and has directed the
                            minister resident to obtain from the belligerent powers the recognition
                            of the following points established by the said congress: <list>
                                <item>“1. The neutral flag covers enemy’s goods, with the exception
                                    of contraband of war.</item>
                                <item>“2. Neutral goods, with the exception of contraband of war,
                                    are not liable to capture under enemy’s flag.</item>
                                <item>“3. Blockades, in order to be binding, must be effective; that
                                    is to say, maintained by a force sufficient really to prevent
                                    access to the coast of the enemy.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>“The government hopes, on account of the friendly relations which have
                            existed between it and the American States for years, to obtain the
                            recognition of these three points on the part of the belligerents.”</p>
                        <p>In an interview with Count Rechberg a day or two ago, he expressed to me
                            a hope that the answer might be deemed satisfactory to my government, as
                            it was his wish to make it so. I replied that, so far as I was advised,
                            no exception could be taken to his language, but that I should transmit
                            to my government both the question and answer, and if they had anything
                            to say they would make it known to him through their minister here. He
                            repeated his strong desire to see the integrity of the Union preserved
                            in America, and said Austria was anxious to cultivate the most friendly
                            relations with us, and would be the last to aid or abet any movement
                            looking to the disruption of our confederacy, or weakening its
                            power.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: With deep regret we continue to follow
                                events in the United States which, shaking the foundations of the
                                Union, have effectively taken the character of an active warfare
                                between powers; whence it has ensued that friendly nations, for the
                                protection of their own commerce and navigation, are placed
                                reluctantly in such position that they must reclaim their rights as
                                neutrals.</p>
                            <p>You already know by my despatch of 14th June of last year what
                                principles of international law bearing upon the questions of
                                maritime rights in time of war we relied upon as between us and the
                                government of the Union, whether under the provisions of old
                                treaties, or under more recent arrangements; inasmuch as we have
                                given our adhesion to the Paris declaration of maritime rights in
                                1856, as tending to improve the heretofore ill-advised mode of
                                dealing with the political fluctuations that lie before us.</p>
                            <p>Albeit the government of the Union did not explicitly and at once
                                accept, upon the first invitation, the declaration of the European
                                powers, yet we still entertain an earnest expectation that such
                                subsequent express assent may be given, as the abrogation of all
                                hindrance to the security of private property on the seas was
                                established on the broadest grounds.</p>
                            <p>By a proposal which, unfortunately, was not accepted on the other
                                side, we, however, as you know, were always ready and willing to
                                sustain the principle.</p>
                            <p>We await, however, in friendly expectation, at least, the express
                                recognition of the second, third, and fourth principles of the Paris
                                declaration on the part of the United States quite distinctly from
                                that, because the government of the Union, on different occasions,
                                has not only plainly expressed these principles in manner more or
                                less forcible, but has upon its own motion set them forth and
                                explicitly maintained them.</p>
                            <p>We therefore rest securely in the belief that we may soon receive a
                                satisfactory communication upon this subject, and that under the
                                high-authority of the President, administering the relations of his
                                government, the above mentioned three principles will be
                                authentically asserted by the United States. But you also have it in
                                express charge to invite the earnest attention of the Secretary of
                                State to the matter, and to take the same steps as we see reason to
                                adopt with the other European powers in what may be regarded as
                                definitively settled.</p>
                            <p>You will, I hope, carry this important question through to a
                                favorable close, and I present you the assurances of my cordial
                                sympathies.</p>

                        <p>The undersigned, the Secretary of State of the United States, has the
                            honor to acknowledge the receipt of a communication from Mr. Hülsemann,
                                <pb n="191" xml:id="pg_191" facs="0191"/> minister resident of his
                            imperial royal Majesty the Emperor of Austria, bearing date 7th August,
                            instant. Mr. Hülsemann’s letter is accompanied by an instruction sent to
                            him by Count Rechberg, the Austrian minister for foreign affairs,
                            calling for information on the subject of the views of this government
                            concerning the rights of neutrals in maritime war. Count Rechberg
                            expresses a hope that the government of the United States will give
                            assurances that it adopts and will apply the 2d, 3d, and 4th principles
                            of the declaration of Paris, viz: <list>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>The neutral flag covers enemy’s goods, with the exception of
                                    contraband of war.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>Neutral goods, with the exception of contraband of war, are
                                    not liable to capture under enemy’s flag.</item>
                                <label>4.</label>
                                <item>Blockades, in order to be binding, must be effective; that is
                                    to say, maintained by a force sufficient really to prevent
                                    access to the coast of the enemy.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>The undersigned has great pleasure in assuring Mr. Hülsemann that this
                            government does adopt, and that it will apply the principles thus
                            recited and set forth, and that its liberal views in this respect have
                            not only been long held, but they would have been formally communicated
                            to the Austrian government several months ago but for the delay which
                            has unavoidably occurred in the arrival of a newly appointed minister
                            plenipotentiary at Vienna.</p>
                        <p>Of course the principles referred to are understood by the United States
                            as not compromitting their right to close any of their own ports for the
                            purpose of suppressing the existing insurrection in certain of the
                            States, either directly or in the more lenient and equitable form of
                            blockade which has already for some time been established.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Motley, who proceeds immediately to Vienna as envoy extraordinary and
                            minister plenipotentiary of the United States, will be directly advised
                            of this communication, while he will be charged with more ample
                            instructions on the general subject involved.</p>
                        <p>The undersigned avails himself of this occasion to tender assurances of
                            the good will of this government towards the government of Austria, and
                            of his distinguished consideration for Mr. Hülsemann personally.</p>

                            has just been received. Owing to the change of Mr. Burlingame’s
                            destination, the instructions he conveyed have failed to reach your
                            legation. A new appointment has just now been made in the person of Mr.
                            Motley, who will, without much delay, proceed to relieve you of the
                            mission which you have conducted so satisfactorily during the period of
                            my connexion with this department.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Motley will have full powers to treat with the government of Austria
                            on all the matters discussed by Count Rechberg in the speech to which,
                            by his direction, you have called ray attention, and I am sure that they
                            will be disposed of to the entire satisfaction of Austria, as well as
                            for the common advantage of both countries.</p>

                        <p>In the meantime, however, you are authorized to say to Count Rechberg
                            that the United States adhere now, as heretofore, to the three
                            principles enunciated by him in that speech, namely: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>The neutral flag covers enemy’s goods, with the exception of
                                    contraband of war.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>Neutral goods, not contraband of war, are not liable to
                                    confiscation under enemy’s flag.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>

                            </list></p>
                        <p>Of course these principles are understood by us as not compromising our
                            right to close any of our own ports for the purpose of suppressing the
                            existing insurrection, either directly or in the more lenient and
                            equitable form of blockade which we have already some time since
                            established.</p>
                        <p>You will not fail to assure the imperial royal government that the

                            Hülsemann, the minister of Austria residing at this capital.</p>

                            interest. It relates, however, exclusively to the affairs of Austria,
                            and does not seem to require any special remark from me at the present

                            Mr. Jones, under date of August, has been received. I send you a copy of
                            my latest instructions to Mr. Adams and Mr. Dayton on the subject of the
                            proposed accession to the declaration of the congress at Paris. You will
                            learn from these papers that the negotiations for that object with the
                            governments of Great Britain and <pb n="193" xml:id="pg_193" facs="0193"
                            /> France have been arrested, as well as the manner of suspension, and
                            the reasons for it. You will already have discovered for yourself that
                            this suspension of the negotiation with those two powers must operate,
                            to a certain extent, upon the dispositions in the same respect of other
                            European States, although it does not at all modify the views of this
                            government. So far as such other European powers are concerned, all that
                            remains to be said is, that acting in good faith we will cheerfully
                            enter into convention with any State that may desire to receive our
                            accession at this time, and that we shall not, at present, urge our
                            proposition on those States which, for any reason of their own, may
                            propose to await a more convenient season.</p>
                        <p>You will inform Count Rechberg that the friendly sentiments of this
                            government towards Austria remain unchanged.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: You enter a very important foreign mission
                            at a moment when our domestic affairs have reached a crisis which
                            awakens deep solicitude. Throughout a period of eighty years law and
                            order have prevailed, and internal peace and tranquillity have been
                            undisturbed. Five months ago sedition showed itself openly in several of
                            the southern States, and it has acted ever since that time with
                            boldness, skill, and energy. An insurrectionary government, embracing
                            seven members of this Union, has been proclaimed under the name of the
                            Confederate States of America. That pretended authority, by means
                            chiefly of surprise, easily seen here to have been unavoidable, although
                            liable to be misunderstood abroad, has possessed itself of a navy yard,
                            several fortifications and arsenals, and considerable quantities of
                            arms, ordnance, and military stores. On the 12th of April, instant, its
                            forces commenced an attack upon, and ultimately carried, Fort Sumter,
                            against the brave, and heroic resistance of a diminutive garrison, which
                            had been, through the neglect of the former administration, left in a
                            condition to prevent supplies and re-enforcements.</p>
                        <p>Owing to the very peculiar construction of our system, the late
                            administration, Congress, and every other department of the federal
                            government, including the army and the navy, contained agents, abettors,
                            and sympathizers in this insurrection. The federal authorities thus
                            became inefficient, while large portions of the people were bewildered
                            by the suddenness of the appearance of disunion, by apprehension that
                            needless resistance might aggravate and precipitate the movement, and by
                            political affinities with those engaged in it.</p>
                        <p>The project of dismembering the Union doubtless has some support in
                            commercial and political ambition. But it is chiefly based upon a local,
                            though widely extended partisan disappointment in the result of the
                            recent election of President of the United States. It acquired strength
                            for a time from its assumed character of legitimate opposition to a
                            successful party, while, on the other hand, that party could not all at
                            once accept the fact that an administrative political issue had given
                            place to one which involved the very existence of the government and of
                            the Union. These embarrassments are passing away so rapidly as to
                            indicate that far the greater mass of the people remain loyal as
                            heretofore. The President improved the temporary misfortune of the fall
                            of Fort Sumter by calling on the militia of the States to re-enforce the
                            federal army, and summoning Congress for its counsel and aid in the
                            emergency. On the other hand, the insurrectionists have met those
                            measures with an invitation to privateers from all lands to come forth
                            and commit depredations on the commerce of the country.</p>
                        <p>To take care that the government of his Majesty the Emperor of France, do
                            not misunderstand our position, and through that misunderstanding do <pb
                                n="196" xml:id="pg_196" facs="0196"/> us some possible wrong, is the
                            chief duty which you will have to perform at Paris.</p>
                        <p>It would have been gratifying to the President if the movements to which
                            I have alluded had taken such a course as to leave this government free
                            from the necessity in any event of conferring upon them in the presence
                            of foreign powers. In this age of social development, however, isolation
                            even in misfortune is impossible, and every attempt at revolution in one
                            country becomes a subject of discussion in every other. The agitators in
                            this case have, perhaps, not unnaturally carried their bad cause before
                            foreign states by an appeal for recognition of the independence, they
                            have proclaimed, and which they are committed to establish by arms.
                            Prudence requires that we oppose that appeal. The President believes
                            that you will be able to do this in such a manner as will at once
                            comport with the high consideration for his Imperial Majesty which this
                            government habitually entertains, and a due sense of the dignity and
                            honor of the American people.</p>
                        <p>The Emperor of France has given abundant proofs that he considers the
                            people in every country the rightful source of all authority, and that
                            its only legitimate objects are their safety, freedom, and welfare. He
                            is versed in our Constitution, and, therefore, he will not need
                            demonstration that the system which is established by the Constitution
                            is founded strictly on those very principles. You will be at no loss to
                            show also that it is perfectly adapted to the physical condition and the
                            temper, spirit, and habits of the American people. In all its essential
                            features it is the same system which was first built, and has since
                            existed with ever renewed popular consent in this part of America. The
                            people of this country have always enjoyed the personal rights
                            guaranteed by the great statutes of British freedom, representation
                            concurrent with taxation, jury trial, liberty of conscience, equality
                            before the laws, and popular suffrage. The element of federation or
                            union was early developed while the colonies were under the authority
                            of, and during their revolutionary contest with, the British Crown, and
                            was perfected afterwards by the establishment of the Constitution of the
                            United States. Practically it has been voluntarily accepted by every
                            State, Territory, and individual citizen of the United States. The
                            working of the system has been completely successful, while not one
                            square mile of domain that we at any time had occupied has ever been
                            lost to us. We have extended our jurisdiction from the St. Mary’s river
                            to the Rio Grande, on the Gulf of Mexico, and in a wide belt from the
                            Mississippi to the Pacific ocean. Our population has swollen from four
                            millions to thirty-one millions. The number of our States has increased
                            from thirteen to thirty-four. Our country has risen from insignificance
                            to be the second in the world. Leaving out of view unimportant local
                            instances of conflict, we have had only two foreign wars, and the
                            aggregate duration of them was less than five years. Not one human life
                            has hitherto been forfeited for disloyalty to the government, nor has
                            martial law ever been established except temporarily in case of
                            invasion. No other people have ever enjoyed so much immunity from the
                            various forms of political casualties and calamities.</p>
                        <p>While there is not now, even in the midst of the gathering excitement of
                            civil war, one American who declares his dissent from the principles of
                            the Constitution, that great charter of federal authority has won the
                            approbation of the civilized world. Many nations have taken it as a
                            model, and almost every other one has in some degree conformed its
                            institutions to the principles of this Constitution. The empire of
                            France, and the new kingdom of Italy especially, are built on the same
                            broad foundation with that of this federal republic, namely, universal
                            suffrage.</p>
                        <p>Surely we cannot err in assuming that a system of government which arose
                            out of the free consent of the people of this country, which has been
                                <pb n="197" xml:id="pg_197" facs="0197"/> often reconsidered and yet
                            continually upheld in preference to every other throughout a period of
                            two hundred years, which has commanded the acceptance or the approval of
                            all other nations, and to the principles of which even those who attempt
                            to overthrow it adhere in the very heat of insurrection, must be
                            regarded as one which is not only well adapted to the condition and
                            character of the American people, but is even indispensable and
                            inseparable from their national existence.</p>
                        <p>Should it be answered that while all this has heretofore seemed true, yet
                            that it is now disproved by the existing insurrection, you may
                            truthfully reply that we must wait for that refutation until we see the
                            end of the insurrection; that the insurrection proves in fact nothing
                            else except that eighty years of peace is as much as human nature has
                            the moderation to endure under circumstances the most conducive to
                            moderation.</p>
                        <p>The attempted revolution is simply causeless. It is, indeed, equally
                            without a reason, and without an object. Confessedly there is neither
                            reason nor object, unless it be one arising out of the subject of
                            slavery. The practice of slavery has been so long a theme of angry
                            political debate, while it has all the time been, as it yet is, a
                            domestic concern, that I approach it with deep regret in a communication
                            which relates to the action of a representative of this government
                            abroad. I refrain from any observation whatever concerning the morality
                            or, the immorality, the economy or the waste, the social or the unsocial
                            aspects of slavery, and confine myself, by direction of the President,
                            strictly to the point that the attempt at revolution on account of it
                            is, as I have already said, without reason and without object Slavery of
                            persons of African derivation existed practically within all the
                            European colonies which, as States, now constitute the United States of
                            America. The framers of our government accepted that fact, and with it
                            the ideas concerning it which were then gaining ground throughout the
                            civilized world. They expected and desired that it should ultimately
                            cease, and with that view authorized Congress to prohibit the foreign
                            slave trade after 1808. They did not expect that the practice of African
                            slavery should be abruptly terminated to the prejudice of the peace and
                            the economy of the country. They therefore placed the entire control of
                            slavery, as it was then existing, beyond the control of the federal
                            authorities, by leaving it to remain subject to the exclusive management
                            and disposition of the several States themselves, and fortified it there
                            with a provision for the return of fugitives from labor and service, and
                            another securing an allowance of three-fifths of such persons in fixing
                            the basis of direct taxation and representation. The legislators of that
                            day took notice of the existence of a vast and nearly unoccupied region
                            lying between the western borders of the Atlantic States and the
                            Mississippi river. A few slaves were found in the south-west, and none
                            in the northwest. They left the matter in the southwest to the
                            discretion of the new States to be formed there, and prohibited the
                            practice of slavery in the northwestern region forever.</p>
                        <p>Economical, moral, and political causes have subsequently modified the
                            sentiments of that age differently in the two sections. Long ago slavery
                            was prohibited by all the northern States, and, on the contrary, the
                            increased production of cotton has resulted in fortifying the
                            institution of slavery in the southern States. The accretions of domain,
                            by purchase from Spain, France, and Mexico, brought regions in which
                            slavery had either a very slight foothold, or none at all; and this new
                            domain, as it should come under occupation, was to be constituted into
                            new States, which must be either free States or slave States. The
                            original States divided according to their own divers practices—the free
                            States seeking so to direct federal legislation and action as to result
                            in multiplying free States, and the slave States so to direct them as to
                            multiply slave States. The interest became more <pb n="198"
                                xml:id="pg_198" facs="0198"/> intense because the several States
                            have equal representation in the Senate of the United States. This
                            controversy soon disclosed itself in the popular elections, and more
                            distinctly than ever before in the recent canvass, which resulted in the
                            accession of the present administration.</p>
                        <p>It is now to be observed that, from the earliest agitation of the subject
                            until that last election, the decisions of the people were practically
                            favorable to the interest of the class which favored the extension of
                            slavery, and yet their opponents always acquiesced. Under these
                            circumstances the executive administration, the national legislature,
                            and the judiciary, were for practical purposes in the hands of that
                            party, and the laws, with the administration and execution of them,
                            conformed to their own policy. The opposite class prevailed in the late
                            election so far as to bring in the President and Vice-President, the
                            citizens they had preferred, but no further—Congress and the judiciary
                            remained under the same bias as before. The new President could not
                            assume his trust until the fourth of March, 1861, and even after that
                            time, as before, the laws and the execution of them must remain
                            unchanged. He could not, without consent of his opponents in Congress,
                            change either, nor appoint a minister or a ministerial officer, nor draw
                            a dollar from the treasury even for his own defence or support. It was
                            under these circumstances that, on the very day when the election closed
                            and its result became known, four months before the new administration
                            was to come in, the disappointed party took their appeal from the
                            ballot-box to arms, and inaugurated their revolution.</p>
                        <p>I need not further elaborate the proposition that the revolution is
                            without a cause; it has not even a pretext.</p>
                        <p>It is just as clear that it is without an object. Moral and physical
                            causes have determined inflexibly the character of each one of the
                            Territories over which the dispute has arisen, and both parties after
                            the election harmoniously agreed on all the federal laws required for
                            their organization. The Territories will remain in all respects the
                            same, whether the revolution shall succeed or shall fail. The condition
                            of slavery in the several States will remain just the same whether it
                            succeed or fail. There is not even a pretext for the complaint that the
                            disaffected States are to be conquered by the United States if the
                            revolution fail; for the rights of the States, and the condition of
                            every human being in them, will remain subject to exactly the same laws
                            and forms of administration, whether the revolution shall succeed or
                            whether it shall fail. In the one case, the States would be federally
                            connected with the new confederacy; in the other, they would, as now, be
                            members of the United States; but their constitutions and laws, customs,
                            habits, and institutions in either case will remain the same.</p>
                        <p>It is hardly necessary to add to this incontestible statement the further
                            fact that the new President, as well as the citizens through whose
                            suffrages he has come into the administration, has always repudiated all
                            designs whatever and wherever imputed to him and them of disturbing the
                            system of slavery as it is existing under the Constitution and laws. The
                            case, however, would not be fully presented if I were to omit to say
                            that any such effort on his part would be unconstitutional, and all his
                            actions in that direction would be prevented by the judicial authority,
                            even though they were assented to by Congress and the people.</p>
                        <p>This revolution, thus equally destitute of just cause and legitimate
                            object, aims, nevertheless, at the dismemberment of the federal Union,
                            and, if successful, must end in the overthrow of the government of the
                            United States. If it be true, as the consent of mankind authorizes us to
                            assume, that the establishment of this government was the most
                            auspicious political event that has happened in the whole progress of
                            history, its fall must be deemed not merely a national calamity, which a
                            patriotic government ought to try <pb n="199" xml:id="pg_199"
                                facs="0199"/> to prevent, but a misfortune to the human race, which
                            should secure for us at least the forbearance of all other nations.</p>
                        <p>It cannot be maintained that disunion would leave it still existing in
                            its true character, and for its proper ends, although in two not very
                            unequal and similar parts. Its integrity as a federal government,
                            embracing all of the American independent, contiguous, and homogeneous
                            States, protecting them all against foreign dangers and internal
                            commotions; securing to them all a common property, greatness, dignity,
                            influence and happiness, is an indispensable feature of its
                            constitution.</p>
                        <p>Dismemberment would be less effectually subversive of the character,
                            objects, and purposes of the Union, if the two confederacies, which it
                            is proposed shall succeed it, could severally be expected to exercise
                            its great functions within their respective dominions. But this would be
                            impossible. The several States are now held in union with each other by
                            a confessed obligation of cohesion that only their common consent could
                            dissolve, and that moral law, hitherto acknowledged by all, is
                            substituted for the central military authority which, in other systems,
                            secures the integrity as well as the peace and harmony of States. But if
                            the revolution shall prevail and dismemberment ensue, the federal
                            obligation in that case will be broken, its moral force spent, and in
                            its place there must come up the principles which are the acknowledged
                            elements of the revolution, namely, first, that in either confederacy
                            each State is at liberty to secede at pleasure; and secondly, the
                            minority in each confederacy, and even in each State, may, whenever the
                            will of the majority is ascertained, take an appeal from the ballot to
                            the sword. It is manifest that the success of this revolution would
                            therefore be not only a practical overthrow of the entire system of
                            government, but the first stage by each confederacy in the road to
                            anarchy, such as so widely prevails in Spanish America. The contest,
                            then, involves nothing less than a failure of the hope to devise a
                            stable system of government upon the principle of the consent of the
                            people, and working through the peaceful expressions of their will
                            without depending on military authority. If the President were
                            addressing his countrymen at home on this occasion, instead of one of
                            their representatives going abroad, he would direct me to set forth the
                            consequences which obviously must follow the dissolution of the American
                            Union. The loss of the ambition, which is a needful inspiration to a
                            great people; the loss of the respect of mankind, and the veneration and
                            respect of posterity; the loss of the enterprise and vigor which makes
                            us a prosperous nation; and with the loss of sustained and constant
                            culture, which makes us an intellectual people, the loss of safety, both
                            at home and abroad, which directly involves the greatest calamity of
                            all, the loss of liberty It is sufficient only to allude to these
                            possible evils on this accasion to afford you the grounds for assuring
                            the government of France that the President regards the revolution as
                            one which in every event must and will be prevented, since it is
                            manifest that the evils which would result from its success would be as
                            incurable as they would be intolerable.</p>
                        <p>It is, indeed, an occasion of much regret that it has been found needful
                            to employ force for this purpose. It is contrary to the genius and the
                            habits of the people, as it is repugnant to the sentiments of the
                            government of the country and of mankind. But the President believes
                            that the country will accept that alternative with the less regret
                            because sufficient time has been allowed to try every expedient of
                            conciliatory prevention, and civil war is at last proved to be
                            unavoidable. The responsibility of it must rest with those who have not
                            only inaugurated it, but have done so without cause and without
                            provocation. The world will see that it is an evil that comes upon us
                            not from any necessity growing out of administration or out of our
                            Constitution itself, but from a necessity growing out of our common
                            nature.</p>
                        <pb n="200" xml:id="pg_200" facs="0200"/>
                        <p>It must not, however, be inferred that the reluctance of the government
                            to employ force so long has demoralized the administration or can
                            demoralize the American people. They are capable of a high, resolute,
                            and vigorous defence of the Union, and they will maintain that defence
                            with only the more firmness and fidelity, because they are animated by
                            no hostile spirit, but, on the contrary, by a friendly and even
                            fraternal one, being satisfied that its benefits will result equally to
                            those who are engaged in overthrowing and those who are engaged in
                            defending the Union.</p>
                        <p>I have thus, under the President’s direction, placed before you a simple,
                            unexaggerated, and dispassionate statement of the origin, nature, and
                            purposes of the contest in which the United States are now involved. I
                            have done so only for the purpose of deducing from it the arguments you
                            will find it necessary to employ in opposing the application of the
                            so-called Confederate States to the government of his Majesty the
                            Emperor for a recognition of its independence and sovereignty.</p>
                        <p>The President neither expects nor desires any intervention, or even any
                            favor, from the government of France, or any other, in this emergency.
                            Whatever else he may consent to do, he will never invoke nor even admit
                            foreign interference or influence in this or any other controversy in
                            which the government of the United States may be engaged with any
                            portion of the American people. It has been simply his aim to show that
                            the present controversy furnishes no one ground on which a great and
                            friendly power, like France, can justly lend aid or sympathy to the
                            party engaged in insurrection, and therefore he instructs you to insist
                            on the practice of neutrality by the government of the Emperor, as all
                            our representatives are instructed to insist on the neutrality of the
                            several powers to which they are accredited.</p>
                        <p>Not entertaining the least apprehension of the departure from that course
                            by his Majesty’s government, it is not without some reluctance that the
                            President consents to the suggestion of some considerations affecting
                            France herself, which you may urge in support of it. France is an
                            agricultural and manufacturing country. Her industry depends very
                            largely on a consumption of her productions and fabrics within the
                            United States, and on the receipt, in exchange, of cotton, or other
                            staples, or their equivalent in money, from the United States. The
                            ability of the United States to thus consume and furnish depends on
                            their ability to maintain and preserve peace. War here will in any case
                            be less flagrant, and peace, when broken, will be restored all the more
                            quickly and all the more perfectly if foreign nations shall have the
                            sagacity, not to say the magnanimity, to practice the neutrality we
                            demand.</p>
                        <p>Foreign intervention would oblige us to treat those who should yield it
                            as allies of the insurrectionary party, and to carry on the war against
                            them as enemies. The case would not be relieved, but, on the contrary,
                            would only be aggravated, if several European states should combine in
                            that intervention. The President and the people of the United States
                            deem the Union, which would then be at stake, worth all the cost and all
                            the sacrifices of a contest with the world in arms, if such a contest
                            should prove inevitable.</p>
                        <p>However other European powers may mistake, his Majesty is the last one of
                            those sovereigns to misapprehend the nature of this controversy. He
                            knows that the revolution of 1775 in this country was a successful
                            contest of the great American idea of free popular government against
                            resisting prejudices and errors. He knows that the conflict awakened the
                            sympathies of mankind, and that ultimately the triumph of that idea has
                            been hailed by all European nations. He knows at what cost European
                            nations resisted for a time the progress of that idea, and perhaps is
                            not unwilling to confess how much France, especially, has profited by
                            it. He will not fail to recognize the presence of that one great idea in
                            the present conflict, nor will he mistake <pb n="201" xml:id="pg_201"
                                facs="0201"/> the side on which it will be found. It is, in short,
                            the very principle of universal suffrage, with its claim to obedience to
                            its decrees, on which the government of France is built, that is put in
                            issue by the insurrection here, and is in this emergency to be
                            vindicated, and, more effectually than ever, established by the
                            government of the United States.</p>
                        <p>I forbear from treating of questions arising out of the revenue laws of
                            the United States, which lately have been supposed to have some bearing
                            on the subject. They have already passed away before the proclamation of
                            the blockade of ports in the hands of the revolutionary party. Nor could
                            considerations so merely mercenary and ephemeral in any case enter into
                            the counsels of the Emperor of France.</p>
                        <p>You will, naturally enough, be asked what is the President’s expectation
                            concerning the progress of the contest and the prospect of its
                            termination. It is, of course, impossible to speculate, with any
                            confidence, upon the course of a revolution, and to fix times and
                            seasons for the occurrence of political events affected by the
                            excitement of popular passions; but there are two things which may be
                            assumed as certain: First. That the union of these States is an object
                            of supreme and undying devotion on the part of the American people, and,
                            therefore, it will be vindicated and maintained. Secondly. The American
                            people, notwithstanding any temporary disturbance of their equanimity,
                            are yet a sagacious and practical people, and less experience of evils
                            than any other nation would require will bring them back to their
                            customary and habitual exercise of reason and reflection, and, through
                            that process, to the settlement of the controversy without further
                            devastation and demoralization by needless continuance in a state of
                            civil war.</p>
                        <p>The President recognizes, to a certain extent, the European idea of the
                            balance of power. If the principle has any foundation at all, the
                            independence and the stability of these United States just in their
                            present form, properties, and character, are essential to the
                            preservation of the balance between the nations of the earth as it now
                            exists. It is not easy to see how France, Great Britain, Russia, or even
                            reviving Spain, could hope to suppress wars of ambition which must
                            inevitably break out if this continent of North America, now, after the
                            exclusion of foreign interests for three-quarters of a century, is again
                            to become a theatre for the ambition and cupidity of European
                            nations.</p>
                        <p>It stands forth now to the glory of France that she contributed to the
                            emancipation of this continent from the control of European states, an
                            emancipation which has rendered only less benefit to those nations than
                            to America itself. The present enlightened monarch of France is too
                            ambitious, in the generous sense of the word, to signalize his reign by
                            an attempt to reverse that great and magnanimous transaction. He is,
                            moreover, too wise not to understand that the safety and advancement of
                            the United States are guaranteed by the necessities, and, therefore, by
                            the sympathies of mankind.</p>
                        <p>I am, sir, respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I had the honor to-day to receive your
                            despatch, No. 45, touching certain recent political movements in the
                            United States. I had, of course, through the public journals, been made
                            acquainted with the painful facts to <pb n="202" xml:id="pg_202"
                                facs="0202"/> which you refer; but your communication brings them
                            now, for the first time, officially to my notice.</p>
                        <p>I need hardly say to you that the events which have signalized the
                            history of the United States for the last few months have occupied the
                            attention of a very large share of the statesmen and people of Europe.
                            In all my intercourse, public and private, from the Emperor to the
                            peasant, embracing all grades of ministerial and diplomatic agents, it
                            has been the engrossing, I might almost say the only topic of
                            conversation. A revolution was as little anticipated in the United
                            States as an earthquake in Paris.</p>
                        <p>That large communities should be casting off the protection of a
                            government to which thousands on this continent were looking for the
                            realization of all their dreams of happiness on earth; that a system
                            should he pronounced a failure which has produced, within a few years,
                            the most extraordinary developments of national prosperity and power of
                            which history has left any record; that a flag should be trampled in the
                            dust which has never been stained by oppression, and which is hailed as
                            the emblem of civil and religious freedom in every corner of the globe,
                            were problems well calculated to rouse the inquisitive and to puzzle the
                            uninformed. The consequence was, that there has been, within the last
                            four months, throughout Europe a more thorough and general discussion,
                            by the press and by individuals, of American institutions than had
                            occurred for the previous twenty years. In general the press of Europe
                            is in able and skilful hands; and if, in their late discussions, it has
                            occasionally fallen into some egregious blunders, it shows how little
                            familiar the best-informed were with the details of our system when
                            those events arose which have attracted to our condition the gaze of
                            Europe.</p>
                        <p>You inform me that it is not improbable that persons claiming to
                            represent the States which have attempted, to throw off their federal
                            obligations will seek a recognition of their independence by the Emperor
                            of the French; that you would regard such an act, on the part of the
                            French government, as calculated to encourage the revolutionary
                            movements of the seceding States, and to increase the dangers of
                            disaffection in those which shall remain loyal; that it would be
                            inconsistent with the friendship which the government of the United
                            States has always heretofore experienced from the government of France;
                            that it would tend to disturb the friendly relations, diplomatic and
                            commercial, now existing between those two powers, and prove adverse to
                            the interests of France and the United States.</p>
                        <p>You have not in your despatch informed me what line of policy it is the
                            purpose of the federal government to adopt towards the seceding States,
                            a fact most material in determining my own action, as well as the views
                            to be addressed to a foreign power on the points presented by your
                            instructions. If I correctly construe the intentions of the government,
                            it looks to a pacific solution of the difficulties which now disturb its
                            relations with the seceding States. In other words, it does not propose
                            to resort to the strong arm of military power to coerce those States
                            into submission to the federal authority. If this be a correct view of
                            its proposed action, and all who understand the genius of our
                            institutions and the character of our people must hope that it shall be
                            such, the only difficulty will be in making European governments
                            appreciate the spirit of such wise and conciliatory policy, and
                            comprehend the just application of the principles of international
                            jurisprudence to a state of facts so novel and peculiar.</p>
                        <p>The fact which seems chiefly to have governed the conduct of nations in
                            establishing diplomatic and commercial relations with States or
                            provinces which have thrown off their allegiance to the general power—I
                            mean, of course, apart from the fact of their ability to maintain
                            international relations with the world—is the practical cessation of all
                            attempts by arms to enforce <pb n="203" xml:id="pg_203" facs="0203"/>
                            obedience to the authority asserted. This rule is founded upon the idea
                            that force, successfully exerted or resisted, is the only criterion by
                            which the respective claims to sovereignty of the contending parties can
                            be adjudged. And, unfortunately, the past history of the world exhibits
                            no other influence which has been deemed fit and proper to be invoked to
                            maintain authority or to suppress revolution. But it is obvious that
                            this rule cannot be rigidly applied by foreign governments to our
                            political system, nor to the course of policy which the federal
                            government has thought expedient to pursue towards the seceding States,
                            without exhibiting, on the part of such foreign government, a most
                            unfriendly disregard of the rights and interests of the remaining
                            twenty-eight States, and an eager desire to dismember the confederacy.
                            Where the parties place the issue fairly upon the arbitrament of the
                            sword, there the result of arms must naturally determine the action of
                            foreign powers. But where force is <hi rend="italic">ab initio</hi>
                            repudiated as the means of terminating the contest; where the appeal is
                            to the reason, judgment, and interests of the seceding States; where
                            time is an essential element to moderate excited passion, to examine
                            into alleged grievances, and to apply the remedies provided by our
                            constitutional system; and especially when it is known that propositions
                            for the adjustment of the points at issue are now being considered by
                            some of the most influential States of the confederacy, a hasty
                            recognition by any foreign power of the independence of the seceding
                            States would exhibit, upon the part of such foreign government, proof as
                            unequivocal of an unfriendly spirit towards the United States as if such
                            recognition were made amidst the clash of arms, and with a view of
                            exerting a moral influence over the result of the struggle. It would
                            seem to me, therefore, that no principle of international law, nor any
                            considerations of courtesy or commercial benefit could justify a foreign
                            power in adding to the embarrassments of our present domestic position
                            by recognizing at this time the independence of the confederated States.
                            No appeal will be made to its sympathy by the allegation of grievous
                            wrong and oppression in the presence of the fact that nine other States,
                            with the same rights and interests involved, equally free, brave, and
                            high spirited, have not deemed the evil sufficient to justify a remedy
                            so extreme. Time has not yet made manifest to the world how far those
                            movements have sprung from passion, or are the results of deliberate
                            judgment; whether they have originated in fears which have since proved
                            unfounded, or are the settled convictions of the popular mind. Nor has
                            any adequate opportunity been afforded for the correction of the
                            grievance complained of by the regular operation of our constitutional
                            system. The foreign power which would, under such circumstances,
                            recognize the independence of those States, and thus frustrate and
                            embarrass the regular and pacific adjustment of our own internal
                            difficulties, would subject itself to grave accusations of hostility to
                            the Union, and give to the federal authority, as the agent and
                            representative of the remaining States, just cause of
                            dissatisfaction.</p>
                        <p>I have no hesitation in expressing it as my opinion, founded upon
                            frequent general interviews with the Emperor, although in no instance
                            touching this particular point, that France will act upon this delicate
                            question when it shall be presented to her consideration in the spirit
                            of a most friendly power; that she will be the last of the great states
                            of Europe to give a hasty encouragement to the dismemberment of the
                            Union, or to afford to the government of the United States, in the
                            contingency to which you refer, any just cause of complaint. The unhappy
                            divisions which have afflicted our country have attracted the Emperor’s
                            earnest attention since the first of January last, and he has never, but
                            upon one occasion of our meeting since, failed to make them the subject
                            of friendly inquiry, and often of comment. He looks upon the
                            dismemberment of the American confederacy with no pleasure, <pb n="204"
                                xml:id="pg_204" facs="0204"/> but as a calamity to be deplored by
                            every enlightened friend of human progress. And he would act, not only
                            in conflict with sentiments often expressed, but in opposition to the
                            well understood feelings of the French people, if he should
                            precipitately adopt any step whatever tending to give force and efficacy
                            to those movements of separation, so long as a reasonable hope remains
                            that the federal authority can or should be maintained over the seceding
                            States.</p>
                        <p>The Emperor Napoleon has no selfish purpose to accomplish by the
                            dismemberment of the American Union. As he has upon more than one
                            occasion said to me: “There are no points of collision between France
                            and the United States; their interests are harmonious, and they point to
                            one policy, the closest friendship and the freest commercial
                            intercourse.” He knows full well that the greatness of our republic
                            cannot endanger the stability of his throne, or cast a shadow over the
                            glory of France. He would rather see us united and powerful than
                            dissevered and weak. He is too enlightened to misapprehend the spirit of
                            conciliation which now actuates the conduct of the federal authorities.
                            He knows that appeals to the public judgment perform that function in
                            our republic which is elsewhere only accomplished by brute force. And if
                            armies have not been marshalled, as they would have been ere this in
                            Europe, to give effect to the federal authority, he is aware that it is
                            not because the general government disclaims authority over the seceding
                            States, or is destitute of the means and resources of war, but from an
                            enlightened conviction on its part that time and reflection will be more
                            efficacious than arms in re-establishing the federal authority, and
                            restoring that sentiment of loyalty to the Union which was once the
                            pride of every American heart.</p>
                        <p>I have not, so far, heard that any commissioners have been sent by the
                            seceding States to France. Should they, as you anticipate, arrive
                            shortly, I think I am not mistaken in saying that they will find that
                            the imperial government is not yet prepared to look favorably upon the
                            object of this mission.</p>
                        <p>I have made this despatch longer, perhaps, than was necessary, for I have
                            not had time to elaborate and digest my ideas very carefully, and submit
                            them as suggestions to elicit more fully the views and instructions of
                            the government.</p>
                        <p>I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I called to-day upon Mr. Thouvenel at the
                            ministry of foreign affairs, and was promptly admitted to an interview.
                            Agreeably to your request, I handed to him a copy of the inaugural
                            address of President Lincoln, and added that I was instructed by you to
                            say to him that it embraced the views of the President of the United
                            States upon the difficulties which now disturbed the harmony of the
                            American Union, and also an exposition of the general policy which it
                            was the purpose of the government to pursue with a <pb n="205"
                                xml:id="pg_205" facs="0205"/> view to the preservation of domestic
                            peace and the maintenance of the federal Union. Here Mr. Thouvenel asked
                            if there was not some diversity of opinion in the cabinet of the
                            President as to the proper mode of meeting the difficulties which now
                            disturbed the relations of the States and general government. I replied,
                            upon that point I had no information; under our system the cabinet was
                            but an advising body; its opinions were entitled to weight, but did not
                            necessarily compel the action of the President; the executive power was,
                            by the Constitution, vested exclusively in the President.</p>
                        <p>I said that I was further instructed to assure him that the President of
                            the United States entertains a full confidence in the speedy restoration
                            of the harmony and unity of the government by a firm, yet just and
                            liberal policy, co-operating with the deliberate and loyal action of the
                            American people. Mr. Thouvenel expressed his pleasure at this
                            assurance.</p>
                        <p>I further said that the President regretted that the events going on in
                            the United States might be productive of some possible inconvenience to
                            the people and subjects of France, but he was determined that those
                            inconveniences shall be made as light and transient as possible, and, so
                            far as it may rest with him, that all strangers who may suffer any
                            injury from them shall be indemnified.</p>
                        <p>I said to him that the President thought it not improbable that an appeal
                            would be made before long by the “confederated States” to foreign
                            powers, and, among others, to the government of France, for the
                            recognition of their independence; that no such appeal having yet been
                            made, it was premature and out of place to discuss any of the points
                            involved in that delicate and important inquiry; but the government of
                            the United States desired the fact to be known that whenever any such
                            application shall be made it will meet with opposition from the minister
                            who shall then represent that government at this court.</p>
                        <p>I said to him that my mission at this court would very soon terminate,
                            and that I should have no official connexion with the question which, it
                            was anticipated, might arise upon the demand of the confederated States
                            for the recognition of their independence; that my place would soon be
                            supplied by a distinguished citizen of the State of New Jersey, a
                            gentleman who possessed the confidence of the President, who fully
                            sympathized in his public views, and who would doubtless come fully
                            instructed as to the then wishes and views of the government of the
                            United States, and that the only request which I would now make, and
                            which would close all I had to say in the interview, was that no
                            proposition recognizing the permanent dismemberment of the American
                            Union shall be considered by the French government until after the
                            arrival and reception of the new minister accredited by the United
                            States to this court.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Thouvenel, in reply, said that no application had yet been made to
                            him by the confederated States, in any form, for the recognition of
                            their independence; that the French government was not in the habit of
                            acting hastily upon such questions, as might be seen by its tardiness in
                            recognizing the new kingdom of Italy; that he believed the maintenance
                            of the federal Union, in its integrity, was to be desired for the
                            benefit of the people north and south, as well as for the interests of
                            France, and the government of the United States might rest well assured
                            that no hasty or precipitate action would be taken on that subject by
                            the Emperor. But whilst he gave utterance of these views, he was equally
                            bound to say that the practice and usage of the present century had
                            fully established the right of <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi>
                            governments to recognition when a proper case was made out for the
                            decision of foreign powers. Here the official interview ended.</p>
                        <p>The conversation was then further protracted by an inquiry from Mr.
                            Thouvenel when the new tariff would go into operation, and whether it
                            was <pb n="206" xml:id="pg_206" facs="0206"/> to be regarded as the
                            settled policy of the government. I told him that the first day of the
                            present month had been prescribed as the period when the new duties
                            would take effect; that I had not yet examined its provisions with such
                            care as would justify me in pronouncing an opinion upon its merits; that
                            it was condemned by the commercial classes of the country, and that I
                            had no doubt, from the discontent manifested in several quarters, that
                            the subject would engage the attention of Congress at its next meeting,
                            and probably some important modifications would be made in it. The
                            finances of the government were at this time temporarily embarrassed,
                            and I had no doubt the provisions of the new tariff were adopted with a
                            view, although probably a mistaken one, of sustaining the credit of the
                            treasury as much as of reviving the protective policy. He then asked me
                            my opinion as to the course of policy that would be adopted towards the
                            seceding States, and whether I thought force would be employed to coerce
                            them into submission to the federal authority. I told him that I could
                            only give him my individual opinion, and that I thought force would not
                            be employed; that ours was a government of public opinion, and although
                            the Union unquestionably possessed all the ordinary powers necessary for
                            its preservation, as had been shown in several partial insurrections
                            which had occurred in our history, yet that the extreme powers of
                            government could only be used in accordance with public opinion, and
                            that I was satisfied that the sentiment of the people was opposed to the
                            employment of force against the seceding States. So sincere was the
                            deference felt in that country for the great principles of
                            self-government, and so great the respect for the action of the people,
                            when adopted under the imposing forms of State organization and State
                            sovereignty, that I did not think the employment of force would be
                            tolerated for a moment, and I thought the only solution of our
                            difficulties would be found in such modifications of our constitutional
                            compact as would invite the seceding States back into the Union on a
                            peaceable acquiescence in the assertion of their claims to a separate
                            sovereignty. * * * * * * * * *</p>
                        <p>I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The despatches of your predecessor, Nos.
                            117, 119, and 120, have been received; the latter acknowledging the
                            receipt of our letter of recall and announcing his intended return
                            requires no special notice.</p>
                        <p>No. 117 bears the date of the 5th of April last. It contains only an
                            exposition of Mr. Faulkner’s views of the policy which this government
                            ought to pursue in regard to the disturbed condition of affairs at home,
                            but at the same time gives us no information concerning the state of our
                            affairs in France.</p>
                        <p>The instructions heretofore transmitted to you will show you the
                            President’s views on the subject Mr. Faulkner has discussed, and these
                            will be your guide notwithstanding any different opinions your
                            predecessor may have expressed or left on record at Paris.</p>
                        <pb n="207" xml:id="pg_207" facs="0207"/>
                        <p>No. 119 bears date of the 15th of April last, and contains a report of an
                            official conversation, and also of an unofficial one held between Mr.
                            Faulkner and Mr. Thouvenel.</p>
                        <p>In the former conversation Mr. Thouvenel asked Mr. Faulkner whether there
                            is not some diversity of opinion in the cabinet of the President as to
                            the proper mode of meeting the difficulties which now disturb the
                            relations of the States and the general government. Mr. Faulkner, in
                            reply, said that he had no information on the subject.</p>
                        <p>The matter is of no great moment, yet it is desirable that there be no
                            misapprehension of the true state of the government in the present
                            emergency.</p>
                        <p>You may, therefore, recall that conversation to Mr. Thouvenel’s memory,
                            and then assure him explicitly that there is no difference of opinion
                            whatever between the President and his constitutional advisers, or among
                            those advisers themselves, concerning the policy that has been pursued,
                            and which is now prosecuted by the administration in regard to the
                            unhappy disturbances existing in the country. The path of executive duty
                            has thus far been too plainly marked out by stern necessities to be
                            mistaken, while the solemnity of the great emergency and the
                            responsibilities it devolves have extinguished in the public councils
                            every emotion but those of loyalty and patriotism. It is not in the
                            hands of this administration that this government is to come to an end
                            at all—much less for want of harmony in devotion to the country.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Thouvenel’s declaration that the United States may rest well assured
                            that no hasty or precipitate action will be taken on the subject of the
                            apprehended application of the insurrectionists for a recognition of the
                            independence of the so-called Confederate States is entirely
                            satisfactory, although it was attended by a reservation of views
                            concerning general principles applicable to cases that need not now be
                            discussed.</p>
                        <p>In the unofficial conversation Mr. Faulkner says that he himself
                            expressed the opinion that force would not be resorted to to coerce the
                            so-called seceding States into submission to the federal authority, and
                            that the only solution of the difficulty would be found in such
                            modifications of the constitutional compact as would invite the seceding
                            States back into the Union, or a peaceable acquiescence in the assertion
                            of their claim to a separate sovereignty.</p>
                        <p>The time when these questions had any pertinency or plausibility have
                            passed away. The United States waited patiently while their authority
                            was defied in turbulent assemblies, and in seditious preparations,
                            willing to hope that mediation, offered on all sides, would conciliate
                            and induce the disaffected parties to return to a better mind.</p>
                        <p>But the case is now altogether changed. The insurgents have instituted
                            revolution with open, flagrant, deadly war to compel the United States
                            to acquiesce in the dismemberment of the Union. The United States have
                            accepted this civil war as an inevitable necessity. The constitutional
                            remedies for all the complaints of the insurgents are still open to
                            them, and will remain so. But, on the other hand, the land and naval
                            forces of the Union have been put into activity to restore the federal
                            authority and to save the Union from danger.</p>
                        <p>You cannot be too decided or too explicit in making known to the French
                            government that there is not now, nor has there been, nor will there be
                            any the least idea existing in this government of suffering a
                            dissolution of this Union to take place in any way whatever.</p>
                        <p>There will be here only one nation and one government, and there will be
                            the same republic, and the same constitutional Union that have already
                            survived a dozen national changes, and changes of government in almost
                            every <pb n="208" xml:id="pg_208" facs="0208"/> other country. These
                            will stand hereafter, as they are now, objects of human wonder and human
                            affection.</p>
                        <p>You have seen, on the eve of your departure, the elasticity of the
                            national spirit, the vigor of the national government, and the lavish
                            devotion of the national treasures to this great cause. Tell Mr.
                            Thouvenel, then, with the highest consideration and good feeling, that
                            the thought of a dissolution of this Union, peaceably or by force, has
                            never entered into the mind of any candid statesman here, and it is high
                            time that it be dismissed by statesmen in Europe.</p>
                        <p>I am, sir, respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the pleasure to announce to you my
                            arrival in this city on Saturday, May 11. On Monday, application was
                            made through our legation for an audience with Mr. Thouvenel, minister
                            of foreign affairs, which was granted for the 16th instant, on which day
                            I was duly presented to him by Mr. Walsh, of the American legation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Thouvenel, in the course of the conversation, took occasion to say
                            that he deeply regretted the condition of things in the United States,
                            and that in this expression of feeling he represented the views and
                            feelings of the Emperor; that so deeply concerned was the Emperor that
                            he had felt disposed to offer his good offices, but had been deterred
                            from the fear that his offer might not be well received; but should
                            occasion for this arise, he would always be ready and happy to be of
                            use. He made special inquiry as to the policy of our government in
                            regard to neutral rights, particularly in reference to neutral property
                            found in southern ships. He went into considerable detail to show that
                            historical precedents were in favor of treating southern vessels as
                            those of a regular belligerent, and applying the same doctrine to them
                            as had always been upheld by the United States. He dwelt particularly
                            upon the fact that Great Britain, during our revolutionary war, had not
                            considered our privateers as pirates. I understood him to say that, as
                            respects an effective blockade, it would be fully recognized and
                            respected; but he seemed much impressed with the importance of
                            understanding clearly the intentions of our government in reference to
                            these matters as respects the foreign world.</p>
                        <p>As respects a tender of the kind offices of the Emperor I could only
                            thank him for the interest in our country which the suggestion
                            manifested, but gave him no reason to suppose such offer at this time
                            would be accepted. As to the doctrines which our government would apply
                            in reference to the blockade of southern ports and neutral rights, I
                            told him I had no specific instructions at present, and could only refer
                            him to the proclamation of the President and the general principles of
                            international law which might bear on the case. I further informed him
                            that immediately after my reception by the Emperor I would apprise my
                            government of the anxiety of the French government to learn the views of
                            our government more definitively upon these questions. You will not fail
                            to have observed that the action of France and England upon this
                            question of belligerent rights has been upon a mutual understanding and
                            agreement.</p>
                        <pb n="209" xml:id="pg_209" facs="0209"/>
                        <p>Throughout the conversation he seemed anxious to impress upon me the
                            great interest which France took in our condition, and their desire for
                            the perpetuation of the Union of the States. He referred to the fact
                            that France had aided in its formation, and did not desire to witness
                            its dissolution. The recognition of the southern confederates as
                            possessing belligerent rights he did not consider at all as recognizing
                            them as independent States.</p>
                        <p>After the conversation had closed, to save time I at once presented a
                            copy of my letters of credence, and requested an audience of the
                            Emperor, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>On the next day I was informed by a note from the minister that I would
                            be received at the palace on the 19th instant, at which time I was
                            presented in due form to the Emperor, in the presence of certain
                            officers of the court.</p>
                        <p>A copy of my remarks to the Emperor will be found enclosed, (letter A.)
                            In reply, the Emperor, after a courteous welcome, and one or two remarks
                            of a character personally complimentary, said, in substance, that he
                            felt great interest in the condition of things in our country; that he
                            was very anxious our difficulties should be settled amicably; that he
                            had been and yet was ready to offer his kind offices, if such offer
                            would be mutually agreeable to the contending parties; that whatever
                            tended to affect injuriously our interests was detrimental to the
                            interests of France, and that he desired a perpetuation of the Union of
                            the States, with some additional remarks of like tenor and character.
                            His observations were in the same vein as those of the minister of
                            foreign affairs, and I doubt not were the frank expressions of his views
                            on this subject.</p>
                        <p>Immediately after the formal part of my presentation had closed, and my
                            letters of credence been delivered, he entered for a short time into
                            general conversation. Upon taking my leave of the Emperor I was
                            conducted by the grand chamberlain to the apartments of the Empress, and
                            there presented to her. She repeated to some extent the same views
                            already presented by the Emperor. My reception at the palace was in
                            every respect agreeable. On Monday, the 20th instant, I called again on
                            Mr. Thouvenel, in company with Mr. Sanford, (our minister to Belgium,)
                            for the purpose of obtaining, if possible, a little more distinct
                            information as to what France meant by the terms “neutral rights” and
                            “belligerent” rights; how far he considered such rights as extending to
                            the capture and condemnation of prizes in the ports of France, &amp;c.
                            He said in reply, in substance, that they held that the flag covers the
                            cargo; and that if a southern ship carrying neutral property was
                            captured, the property would not be condemned, &amp;c. He hoped our
                            government would recognize principles for which it had always contended.
                            I told him it would certainly do so, but the question here was, whether
                            there <hi rend="italic">was a flag;</hi> that our government insisted
                            that the confederates, being merely in rebellion, had no flag, and I
                            could not exactly understand how a foreign government which had not
                            recognized them as an independent power could recognize them as having a
                            flag. He said, furthermore, that the French government had given no
                            warning to their citizens, &amp;c., (as the English government had,) by
                            proclamation, because it was unnecessary; that the statute law of France
                            (of 1825, April 10, I think) declared that any French citizen taking
                            service under a foreign power lost all claim to protection as a citizen;
                            that if a subject of France should take service on board of a letter of
                            marque licensed by the Confederate States, it would be, as I understood
                            him, piratical on the part of such subject. He said, furthermore, that
                            no letters of marque could be fitted out in their ports, or <hi
                                rend="italic">even sheltered</hi> there, unless they came in from
                            necessity, (as stress of weather, &amp;c.,) and then could remain, I
                            think, but twenty-four hours; that Consequently there could be no
                            bringing of prizes into French ports, and while there a condemnation of
                            them in the courts of the southern States. His conversation on this part
                            of the case was very satisfactory, and he <pb n="210" xml:id="pg_210"
                                facs="0210"/> promised me a reference in writing to the French
                            statutes bearing on the question. He added that the French government
                            had addressed certain interrogatories to our government, and would await
                            their answer. The disposition of this government to keep on friendly
                            relations with us is, I think, manifest, and it will not, I judge, be
                            diminished by the obvious fact that certain portions of the public men
                            and the press of England are felicitating themselves on the condition of
                            things in America. The policy of having a heavy commercial power in the
                            west, as some counterpoise to the marine power of England, is too
                            manifest to escape a mind so sagacious as that of the present Emperor of
                            the French. I had taken the liberty before the reception of your last
                            despatch, dated 4th instant, of assuring all persons, official and
                            otherwise, with whom I came in contact, that the most effective measures
                            were being taken by our government to crush out this causeless and
                            wicked rebellion, and that I believed such efforts would be continued to
                            the end; that the fears (which existed in some quarters) that the
                            government would again temporize, and lose the advantage which the
                            present determined enthusiasm of the people gave to it, were groundless.
                            I find very strong feelings existing here in behalf of the Union among
                            the American citizens from the northern States, and a determination to
                            support the government with men and money.</p>
                        <p rend="center">* * * * * * * * * *</p>
                        <p>I have had many applications, since here by foreigners for service as
                            officers in the army of the United States, and I understand from one of
                            the former secretaries of the legation that many applications were made
                            at the office of the legation before I came. There was one case only, as
                            the secretary says, of an application at the office of the legation for
                            service in the army of the south, and this was from an anonymous
                            correspondent, the note seeking service being unsigned. To these
                            applications I have said that our service was open to volunteers, but I
                            had no authority to commit the government to appointments; that, in
                            fact, we needed arms rather than men. * * *</p>
                        <p>No formal notice of the blockade of southern ports has been given to the
                            government here, unless through the agency of the French minister at
                            Washington. Indeed, I think I understood Mr. Thouvenel to say that they
                            had received no such formal notice at all. I shall call the attention of
                            Mr. Thouvenel to the original proclamation when I communicate to him (as
                            I shall at once do) the additional proclamation (just received) of the
                            blockade of the ports of Virginia and North Carolina.</p>
                        <p rend="center">* * * * * * * * * *</p>
                        <p>I have opened, since here, (directed to my predecessor,) a copy of the
                            President’s proclamation as to the blockade of the ports of Virginia and
                            North Carolina, dated 27th April, 1861. I received likewise despatch No.
                            4 last night, containing views of the government at Washington as to the
                            abolition of privateering, and enclosing to me a commission to effect
                            with the French government a treaty for that purpose, with the form of
                            such treaty. This is of great importance, and will affect in a material
                            degree the means of defence on the part of our country in time of war. I
                            shall proceed in conformity, however, with these instructions to
                            communicate with the minister of foreign affairs on the subject. But I
                            cannot help feeling, in view of what the French law is, as heretofore
                            stated, and the little danger to our commerce which can soon arise from
                            any action of this government or of its subjects from privateers, that I
                            had better attempt again to obtain a provision exempting from seizure
                                <hi rend="italic">private</hi> property afloat (unless contraband)
                            the same as private property is now exempt on land. I should very much
                            regret an opportunity lost to obtain such a treaty provision, if
                            possible, before we give up that species of volunteer marine by which we
                            are enabled in some degree to affect the commerce of other nations,
                            having <pb n="211" xml:id="pg_211" facs="0211"/> a heavier naval marine,
                            while they are destroying our own. The Emperor is about to leave Paris
                            for the country, and it is doubtful if great expedition can be had in
                            this matter; but, acting under the direct instructions of the government
                            at home, I shall incur no unnecessary delay in carrying those
                            instructions (if I can procure no better terms) into effect.</p>
                        <p rend="center">* * * * * * * *</p>
                        <p>I have received your despatch (No. 7) containing instructions as to
                            matters to be communicated to Mr. Thouvenel in reference to the unity of
                            the cabinet at Washington and the intentions of the government to
                            prosecute the war with the utmost effect.</p>
                        <p>I will, at the earliest moment, so state to Mr. Thouvenel, though it will
                            be to some extent a restatement of what has already been said. There
                            has, I fear, been some misapprehension upon the minds of the authorities

                                to your Imperial Majesty these, my letters of credence from the
                                President of the United States of America, accrediting me as envoy
                                extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary near to your Majesty.</p>
                            <p>By these letters it is made my especial duty, as it will certainly be
                                my pleasure, with the assent of your Majesty, to cultivate and
                                strengthen the friendship and good correspondence which has
                                heretofore existed between France and the United States, and as far
                                as possible to preserve and advance the interest and happiness of
                                both nations. The people of the United States have not forgotten,
                                nor can they ever forget, that France was their first ally, and
                                throughout the whole period of their national existence has been
                                (with a passing cloud only) their constant friend. An unbroken
                                intercourse of good offices and kind feelings between two great
                                nations for so long a period affords just cause of pride and
                                congratulation to both. Each year has continued to enlarge those
                                business interests which bind us together, and I am happy to know
                                that at no period in our past history have those interests been more
                                prosperous than under the wise, liberal, and enlightened policy of
                                your Imperial Majesty. All our recollections of the past, all our
                                interests of the present, and all our hopes for the future, prompt
                                the United States to cultivate with sedulous care those friendly
                                relations with the government of France which have existed so long
                                and been productive to each nation of results so auspicious.</p>
                            <p>I have it specially in charge from the president of the United States
                                to give assurance to your Imperial Majesty of his disposition to
                                cultivate such friendly relations; to assure your Majesty personally
                                of his high respect and appreciation; to tender to you, to the
                                Empress, your imperial consort, and to each of the members of the
                                imperial family, his best wishes for their <pb n="212"
                                    xml:id="pg_212" facs="0212"/> health, prosperity, and happiness.
                                Permit me only to add that the mission near to your Imperial
                                Majesty, with which I have been honored, is one most grateful to my
                                feelings, and without neglecting the interests of my own government,
                                I shall endeavor so to discharge its duties as to make my residence
                                here entirely agreeable to your Majesty.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Immediately after closing my last despatch
                            I wrote to Mr. Thouvenel a note apprising him that I was fully
                            authorized to enter into a convention with the government of France in
                            respect to privateering, the rights of neutrals, and the matter of
                            blockade, and requesting him, if disposed to renew negotiations upon
                            these subjects, to name a day for conference.</p>
                        <p>My note was not sent until the 25th instant. A copy is attached, marked
                            letter A.</p>
                        <p>On the same day, to wit, the 25th of the present month, I sent to Mr.
                            Thouvenel a copy of the President’s proclamation of the blockade of the
                            ports of Virginia and North Carolina, referring, at the same time, to
                            the previous blockade of the other southern ports. A copy of my note is
                            attached, marked letter C.</p>
                        <p>On the 24th instant I received from the minister of war a note as to
                            certain fire-arms for the State of Virginia, applied for by my
                            predecessor, Mr. Faulkner; a copy of which note, marked D, together with
                            my answer thereto, marked E, is hereunto attached.</p>
                        <p rend="center">* * * * * * </p>
                        <p>I recently received from the agent of our Havre line of steamers a
                            request that I would (by application to the government for munitions of
                            war) aid him to put the steamer Fulton in a condition of defence on her
                            homeward voyage; which I did, so far as I could, by presenting his
                            request to the government. A copy of his request, indorsed by me, is
                            herewith attached, marked II. I presume the request was granted, as I
                            have heard nothing since from the agent, and the steamer leaves her port
                            to-day.</p>
                        <p>I have just received the despatches, by the last steamer, directed to Mr.
                            Sanford, to whom I immediately delivered them; and likewise your
                            circular to me upon the subject of passports, with which I shall
                            carefully comply.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Thouvenel has promptly answered my note informing him I was
                            authorized to enter into a convention as to privateering, &amp;c., and
                            has designated to-morrow, at 4 p. m., for a conference. In my next
                            despatch I shall be able, doubtless, to give you some information as to
                            the views of the French government on this subject. Mr. Marsh has been
                            here, engaged in doing good service by matter communicated for use
                            through the English press.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Burlingame is remaining here for a short time, acting under the
                            advice of his brother diplomatists, owing to matter confidentially
                            communicated from Vienna.</p>
                        <p>With much consideration, your obedient servant,</p>

                            <p>I pray you, sir, to accept for yourself, and convey to the Emperor,
                                my grateful acknowledgments, in behalf of the United States, for the
                                courtesy extended in the expression of a readiness to grant the
                                request of my predecessor; while I deem it proper to say at once
                                that the request for the arms referred to will not, under existing

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: The necessity which exists for
                                arming our steamer, the Fulton, against any attack of the privateers
                                of the southern confederacy obliges Captain Walton to provide
                                himself with <hi rend="italic">two hundred rifles</hi>. These guns,
                                which we have purchased at Leige, (Belgium,) will be delivered
                                to-day or to-morrow at Havre.</p>
                            <p>But we have no cartridges for these guns, and are obliged to buy them
                                in France, and cannot obtain them without an authorization from the
                                minister of war. We are thus obliged to appeal to you, to beg your
                                powerful influence in obtaining the necessary munitions.</p>
                            <p>We desire that the French government furnish us, delivered on board
                                the steamer Fulton, at Havre, <hi rend="italic">twenty thousand
                                    cartouches for hunting rifles</hi>, of the calibre 17 8/10 for
                                the muzzle of the guns. Either our house, at Paris, or that of
                                Messrs. W. Selim &amp; Co., at Havre, will pay the bills.</p>
                            <p>The steamer Fulton will quit Havre Tuesday morning, 28th instant, and
                                it will be necessary that the munition should be delivered
                                Monday.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Mr. Sanford, who was requested by me to
                            look to our interests in Paris in the interval which might elapse
                            between the withdrawal of Mr. Faulkner and your own arrival, has
                            transmitted to me (in his despatch No. 2) an account of a very
                            interesting conversation which he has recently held with Mr. Thouvenel
                            on our internal affairs.</p>
                        <p>In that conversation Mr. Thouvenel intimated that, in view of the great
                            commercial interests which are involved in the domestic controversy
                            which is now agitating the United States, the French government had felt
                            itself constrained to take measures, in conjunction with the government
                            of Great Britain, to meet a condition of things which imperiled those
                            interests. That it had been decided that communications of a similar
                            tenor should be addressed by both of those governments to the government
                            of the United States, and that those communications would be forwarded
                            in the current week. Mr. Thouvenel kindly foreshadowed the points of
                            those communications.</p>
                        <p>As those papers may be expected to arrive by, perhaps, the next steamer,
                            I shall reserve comments upon the propositions indicated until they
                            shall thus be fully and directly brought to the attention of the
                            President.</p>
                        <p>There are, however, some points in the conversation, or suggested by it,
                            which I cannot properly suffer to pass unnoticed.</p>
                        <p>First. I desire that Mr. Thouvenel may be informed that this government
                            cannot but regard any communications held by the French government, even
                            though unofficial, with the agents of the insurrectionary movement in
                            this country as exceptionable and injurious to the dignity and honor of
                            the United States. They protest against this intercourse, however, not
                            so much on that ground as on another. They desire to maintain the most
                            cordial relations with the government of France, and would therefore, if
                            possible, refrain from complaint. But it is manifest that even an
                            unofficial reception of the emissaries of disunion has a certain though
                            measured tendency to give them a prestige which would encourage their
                            efforts to prosecute a civil war destructive to the prosperity of this
                            country and aimed at the overthrow of the government itself. It is
                            earnestly hoped that this protest may be sufficient to relieve this
                            government from the necessity of any action on the unpleasant subject to
                            which it relates.</p>
                        <p>Secondly. The United States cannot for a moment allow the French
                            government to rest under the delusive belief that they will be content
                            to have the confederate States recognized as a belligerent power by
                            States with which this nation is in amity. No concert of action among
                            foreign States so recognizing the insurgents can reconcile the United
                            States to such a proceeding, whatever may be the consequences of
                            resistance.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly. The President turns away from these points of apprehended
                            difference of opinion between the two governments to notice other and
                            more agreeable subjects.</p>
                        <p>The tone of Mr. Thouvenel’s conversation is frank, generous, and cordial;
                            and this government feels itself bound by new ties to France when her
                            Emperor avows his desire for the perpetual union of the States.
                            Especially does this government acknowledge that it is profoundly moved
                            by the declaration of his Majesty, that he would be willing to act as
                            mediator in the civil strife that unhappily convulses our country. These
                            expressions of good will are just what have been expected from the
                            Emperor of France. This government desires that his Majesty may be
                            informed that it indulges <pb n="216" xml:id="pg_216" facs="0216"/> not
                            the least apprehension of a dissolution of the Union in this painful
                            controversy. A favorable issue is deemed certain. What is wanted is that
                            the war may be as short, and attended by as few calamities at home and
                            as few injuries to friendly nations, as possible. No mediation could
                            modify in the least degree the convictions of policy and duty under
                            which this government is acting; while foreign intervention, even in the
                            friendly form of mediation, would produce new and injurious
                            complications. We are free to confess that so cordial is our regard for
                            the Emperor and our confidence in his wisdom and justice, that his
                            mediation would be accepted if all intervention of that kind were not
                            deemed altogether inadmissible. This government perceives, as it thinks,
                            that the French government is indulging in an exaggerated estimate of
                            the moral power and material forces of the insurrection. The government
                            of the United States cheerfully excuses this error, because it knows how
                            unintelligible the working of the American system and the real character
                            of the American people are to European nations. This government knows,
                            moreover, and painfully feels, that the commercial interests of European
                            states are so deeply involved in the restoration of our domestic peace
                            as to excite the highest anxiety and impatience on their part. But it
                            desires the French government to reflect that our commercial interests
                            involved in the issue are even greater than their own; and that every
                            motive that France can have for desiring peace operates still more
                            powerfully on ourselves, besides a thousand motives peculiar to
                            ourselves alone. The measures we have adopted, and are now vigorously
                            pursuing, will terminate the unhappy contest at an early day, and be
                            followed by benefits to ourselves and to all nations greater and better
                            assured than those which have hitherto attended our national progress.
                            Nothing is wanting to that success except that foreign nations shall
                            leave us, as is our right, to manage our own affairs in our own way.
                            They, as well as we, can only suffer by their intervention. No one, we
                            are sure, can judge better than the Emperor of France how dangerous and
                            deplorable would be the emergency that should intrude Europeans into the
                            political contests of the American people.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Since the date of my despatch No. 6 I have
                            had an interview with Mr. Thouvenel.</p>
                        <p>I told him I was authorized to accept the propositions adopted at the
                            congress of Paris in 1856, but with the desire expressed by the
                            President that the provisions should be added exempting private property
                            afloat, unless contraband, from seizure and confiscation. I did not say,
                            nor did he ask, whether the four propositions would be accepted without
                            amendment. He said nothing could be done except by conference with the
                            other powers, but if I would submit the proposition in writing, which I
                            shall at once do, he would immediately address the other powers, and we

                        <p>I have been induced to suggest again the adoption of this amendment <pb
                                n="217" xml:id="pg_217" facs="0217"/> exempting private property
                            afloat from seizure and confiscation: (1.) From the preference or wish
                            of the President expressed in your letter of instruction. (2.) From the
                            great importance, as it seemed to me, of securing the adoption of the
                            principle, if possible, before the United States should give up the
                            right of privateering. (3.) From the facts patent on the correspondence
                            of this legation in 1856, whereby it appears that France and Russia were
                            both favorably disposed at that time to the adoption of the principle of
                            the amendment, (see Mr. Marcy’s despatch to Mr. Mason, No. 94, dated
                            October 4, 1856, and Mr. Mason’s confidential letter to Mr. Dallas, of
                            December 6, 1856,) and the obvious fact that it would be the interest of
                            all the other powers (having little naval force) to concur in the
                            amendment. (4.) From the fact that since the date of your despatch to me
                            authorizing the acceptance of the four propositions adopted by the
                            congress at Paris, Mr. Sanford, our minister to Belgium, on a visit to
                            England, learned from Mr. Adams that the British government had given,
                            as he understood, general instructions on the subject to Lord Lyons; and
                            the impression made on the mind of Mr. Adams, as reported to me by Mr.
                            Sanford, was that it was not improbable that England would now, to
                            secure our concurrence in the other propositions, concur in the
                            amendment. That in view of this information, Mr. Adams, who had like
                            instructions with my own, had referred the matter back to be treated of
                            and discussed at Washington. I could not, therefore, at once accept the
                            four propositions, pure and simple, without running the hazard of
                            conflicting with what might be done elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>I will probably receive an answer from Mr. Thouvenel (after he shall have
                            communicated my proposition to the other powers) before even I shall
                            receive my next despatch on this subject from Washington, which I shall
                            await with some anxiety.</p>

                        <p>The laws, however, in connexion with the practice of the tribunals of
                            France are, I think, as follows: <list>

                                <item>That the captain who accepts a commission from a foreign
                                    government and takes command of a cruiser is guilty of a
                                    piratical act.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>That all French subjects enlisting on board of such cruiser,
                                    without authority of the Emperor, lose their citizenship, and
                                    consequently forfeit their right to the protection of their
                                    government.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>That the principle applied in the French tribunals is unlike
                                    that which has been applied in England (and I fear it will be
                                    found in the United States) as to harboring privateers; and
                                    while their prizes are in a neutral port having them condemned
                                    in courts of admiralty of the country licensing such privateer.
                                    The laws and practice of the French courts do not admit of this.
                                    But these matters, as Mr. Thouvenel now says, must be all left
                                    for determination to the tribunals of France.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>I am happy to say that there is no disposition manifested here, so far as
                            I have observed, to favor the rebellion in our southern States, or to
                            recognize them as an independent power. All recognition of rights on
                            their part is for commercial purposes only. But the government of France
                            cannot, it says, look at this rebellion as a small matter. That,
                            embracing as it does a large section and many States, they cannot apply
                            to it the same reasoning as if it were an unimportant matter or confined
                            to a small locality.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Thouvenel says he has had no application from southern commissioners
                            for any purpose of recognition, and he does not know even that such
                            persons are or have been in Paris.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your despatch (No. 10) was received by me
                            on the 18th instant, and its substance communicated to Mr. Thouvenel on
                            the 19th. On that day I had with him an interesting conversation. I
                            communicated to him the very kind language which you had used in behalf
                            of the President in reference to the Emperor and his willingness to
                            mediate between the north and south, should such mediation be desired.
                            Nothing could have been better expressed than the language of your own
                            despatch; and, without formally reading it to him, I endeavored to
                            repeat, substantially, its language. Mr. Thouvenel seemed much gratified
                            at its tone, and inasmuch as the Emperor had made like remarks to me
                            personally, I begged that your reply might be specially communicated to
                            him, which was readily promised. This, as you may infer, was the most
                            agreeable part of my duty, as connected with your despatch.</p>
                        <p>A short editorial in reference to the recognition of the independence of
                            Italy, and in that connexion of the States of the south, which is
                            herewith enclosed, first appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Patrie</hi>,
                            (a newspaper published in this city, and which has heretofore had a
                            semi-official character.) It was republished on Sunday last in the
                            “Moniteur” without remark, thus giving it an official significance which
                            would not otherwise have been attached to it. It attracted much
                            attention here, and some anxiety. I resolved that at the first
                            opportunity, I would seek an explanation from the minister of foreign
                            affairs. After my communication of your kind remarks, before referred
                            to, I availed myself of the opportunity of calling his attention to this
                            matter. He at once said that his own attention had been arrested by it;
                            that it was a “silliness;” that Mr. Persigny (minister of the interior)
                            was more dissatisfied with it even than he was; that the <hi
                                rend="italic">Patrie</hi> had ceased, ten days ago, to be a
                            semi-official paper; that he did not know how the paragraph had crept
                            into the <hi rend="italic">Moniteur</hi>, but that Count Walewski
                            (minister of state) had been out of the city for ten days past, and that
                            as a consequence matters had not had the usual oversight. He read me a
                            note from the count, in answer to one he (Mr. Thouvenel) had written,
                            inquiring if it would not be better to insert something to show that the
                            paragraph was printed in the <hi rend="italic">Moniteur</hi> by mistake,
                            to which note the count replied that he thought it would be giving an
                            unnecessary importance to the matter, and in that view Mr. Thouvenel,
                            upon reflection, concurred. But he said he was vexed at the insertion in
                            the <hi rend="italic">Moniteur</hi>, and at the commentaries likely to
                            be made upon it. He said, furthermore, (what he has so often said
                            before,) that the French government had no sympathy whatever with the
                            seceding States of the south; that it had no idea of recognizing them as
                            an independent power; that should they, in the course of time, obtain a
                            status as an independent power among nations, and show themselves able
                            to maintain that position, <pb n="219" xml:id="pg_219" facs="0219"/> the
                            French government might ultimately recognize them; but this would be
                            after the expiration of a time ample to test their ability in this
                            behalf. He said, incidentally, three or four years, though I do not
                            suppose he intended anything by this, except to explain more fully his
                            meaning.</p>
                        <p>He said, furthermore, he had received Mr. Rost, (one of the commissioners
                            of the south,) who applied to him through a third party; that he had not
                            applied to be received as a commissioner from the south; if he had so
                            done he would not have received him. * * * * * *</p>

                        <p>Mr. Thouvenel referred, in terms of satisfaction, to a private note which
                            he had received from you, through this legation.</p>
                        <p>I have just received a note from Mr. Perry, our chargé d’affaires at
                            Madrid, under date of the 16th instant, stating that on the next or
                            following day a decree of that government would be made in reference to
                            privateers and Spanish ports, of a like character, in the general, as
                            that which has been made by the French government. This, in view of the
                            locality of certain ports of Spain, will be an important benefit to
                            us.</p>
                        <p>With a blockade of the ports of the south, and the ports of other nations
                            closed against them, there will be little hope left for profitable
                            marauding on the high seas.</p>
                        <p>I think I may say with some confidence that all the efforts of the agents
                            of the confederates on this side of the channel have thus far been
                            abortive. They have no encouragement to their hopes of recognition. They
                            have met with no success in their attempts to negotiate a loan. I do not
                            believe they have got any considerable supply of arms, and I think that
                            we know substantially <hi rend="italic">what they have done</hi> and are
                                <hi rend="italic">attempting to do</hi>. My only fear is of a
                            possible, not probable, reverse to our arms in Virginia, and a rush,
                            under the excitement of a first victory, upon the city of Washington.
                            Should they get possession, by any possibility, of that point, the
                            prestige it would give them (aside from any strategic advantage) might
                            be productive of most unhappy results. God grant that no such future may
                            hang over us.</p>

                            <p>The “Patrie” says:</p>
                            <p>It is asserted that negotiations will be opened to bring about the

                                recognition of the Italian kingdom, composed of the provinces and
                                states which have passed under the sceptre of his Majesty King
                                Victor Emanuel, at the close of occurrences upon which France has
                                not at this time occasion to express herself, but which have
                                transpired through favor of the principle of non-intervention
                                recognized in Europe.</p>
                            <p>The renewal of diplomatic relations with Turin would not imply on the
                                part of France, on the subject of the policy of the Italian kingdom,
                                any <pb n="220" xml:id="pg_220" facs="0220"/> judgment upon the
                                past, nor any solidarity for the future. It would make it appear
                                that the government <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> of this new
                                state is sufficiently established to render it possible to entertain
                                with it those international relations which the interests of the two
                                countries imperatively require.</p>
                            <p>France, in her new attitude, would not purpose to interfere at all
                                with the internal or external affairs of the Italian kingdom, which
                                must be sole judge of its administration, as it is of its future and
                                its destinies. It will act towards it as at some future day the
                                great European powers will act upon the American question, by
                                recognizing the new republic of the southern States when that
                                republic shall have established a government resting on foundations
                                which will permit the formation of international relations with it
                                conducive to general interests.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of a circular dated May 6, 1861, giving instructions in respect
                            to granting passports.</p>
                        <p rend="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
                        <p>I understood him (M. Thouvenel) to say an answer could be got within ten
                            or twelve days from the other powers. I was surprised at the briefness
                            of the time stated, but supposed he meant to consult the representatives
                            of those powers at this court; but his remark, as I am now informed,
                            applied to a consultation with certain of the ministers of the French
                            government only. The statement in the American newspapers, that the
                            Department of State had authorized the acceptance of the Paris treaty of
                            1856 (if that is understood by Lord Lyons to be a distinct acceptance of
                            the treaty, pure and simple) will, I fear, prevent all chance of other
                            terms. The late annunciation of the course of the British government,
                            shutting their ports against privateers, (which so much limits the
                            belligerent rights of the so-called Confederate States,) you will
                            consider, perhaps, renders the accession of our government to the treaty
                            of Paris at this time of less importance than it otherwise would be. I
                            think, from remarks in the New York press, (Herald and Times, and
                            perhaps other prints which I have not seen,) that the force and efficacy
                            of an accession by our government to the treaty of Paris is
                            misunderstood. If I understand the view of these foreign governments,
                            such accession by us would merely bind our hands as respects
                            privateering; it would not at all enlarge our rights as against a
                            belligerent power <hi rend="italic">not a party</hi> to the treaty; nor
                            would it bind these European governments to enforce the laws of piracy
                            as against such belligerent power <hi rend="italic">not a party to the
                                treaty</hi>. If they admit the Confederate States as a belligerent
                            power, and recognize them for even commercial purposes, (which, I take
                            it, is what they mean to do,) our accession to the treaty of Paris will
                            not change their action on this question. The status of these rebellious
                            States as respects privateering will remain where it was; at least that
                            is the view which I think is and will be taken of this question by
                            England and France. But however this may be, I am happy to know that, in
                            suggesting to the French government the amendment to that treaty,
                            (securing private property afloat, unless contraband,) I have occasioned
                            no unnecessary delay, inasmuch as Mr. Adams has referred the whole
                            matter back to Washington, <pb n="221" xml:id="pg_221" facs="0221"/> and
                            as soon as you shall act there, or before, upon a notification to me, I
                            can act here.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your despatch of May 22d (No. 5) has been
                            received. Your safe arrival at your post of duty in this crisis, when
                            our relations to foreign countries, and especially to France, have
                            assumed a degree of interest and importance never known before since the
                            Constitution was established, is a source of sincere satisfaction.</p>
                        <p>The President approves the sentiments you expressed on your presentation
                            to his Imperial Majesty. The manner in which he received you, and the
                            friendly expressions made by himself, as well as those which were
                            employed by Mr. Thouvenel, although not unexpected, have given us the
                            liveliest satisfaction.</p>
                        <p>We appreciate highly the Emperor’s assurance that he would mediate
                            between the government and the insurgents, with a view to the
                            maintenance and preservation of the Union, if such intervention were
                            deemed desirable by us; and that generous offer imposes a new obligation
                            upon us toward France, which we acknowledge with sincere pleasure.</p>
                        <p>If mediation were at all admissible in this grave case, that of his
                            Majesty would not be declined. But the present paramount duty of the
                            government is to save the integrity of the American Union. Absolute,
                            self-sustaining independence is the first and most indispensable element
                            of national existence. This is a republican nation; all its domestic
                            affairs must be conducted and even adjusted in constitutional republican
                            forms and upon constitutional republican principles. This is an American
                            nation, and its internal affairs must not only be conducted with
                            reference to its peculiar continental position, but by and through
                            American agencies alone. These are simple elementary principles of
                            administration, no one of which can be departed from with safety in any
                            emergency whatever; nor could it be departed from with the public
                            consent, which rightfully regulates, through constitutionally
                            constituted popular authorities, the entire business of the
                            government.</p>
                        <p>I have set them forth in no invidious, uncharitable, or ungenerous
                            spirit. I state them fairly and broadly, because I know the magnanimity
                            of the Emperor of France, and I know that he can appreciate directness
                            and candor in diplomacy. I know, moreover, that he is a friend of the
                            United States, and desires that they may continue one great and
                            independent nation forever. I know still further, that the principles I
                            have thus stated will commend themselves to his own great wisdom. To
                            invite or to accept mediation would be incompatible with these
                            principles.</p>
                        <p>When all this has been said, you will then further say to Mr. Thouvenel,
                            or to the Emperor, that if any mediation were at all admissible it would
                            be his own that we should seek or accept.</p>
                        <p>You may say, at the same time, that this government has no apprehension
                            whatever of its being unable to conduct our domestic affairs through
                            this crisis to a safe conclusion; that consummation is even not far
                            distant, if <pb n="222" xml:id="pg_222" facs="0222"/> foreign powers
                            shall practice towards us the same forbearance from intervention which
                            we have habitually practiced towards them in emergencies similar to our
                            own; that intervention by them would only protract and aggravate the
                            civil war in which we are unhappily engaged; that civil war is a scourge
                            to which we are more sensitive than any other people, but that the
                            preservation of national unity, which is national existence, reconciles
                            us to every form of difficulty and to the longest possible endurance of
                            the trial in which we are engaged.</p>
                        <p>Other subjects mentioned in your despatch will be the subject of a
                            special communication after we shall have received the information from
                            the French government which Mr. Thouvenel told Mr. Sanford that he
                            should send with very little delay. It seems desirable to have the
                            positions of the French government in regard to our affairs, as stated
                            by itself, before we answer to inquiries bearing on the subjects to be
                            discussed, which were referred to us through the conversation which took
                            place at the time of your reception.</p>

                            were delivered by me to Mr. Sanford as directed.</p>
                        <p>Your despatch (which is of great interest) was likewise handed by me to
                            Mr. Sanford, to be read and copied if desired, with strict injunctions
                            as to the necessary care to prevent all premature exposure of its
                            contents. * * You will observe in the first column of “Le Moniteur
                            Universel” (a copy of which is herewith sent) that his Majesty the
                            Emperor of the French, has published a formal declaration, setting out
                            the principles by which this government will be controlled in respect to
                            vessels of war or privateers of the United States and of those who <hi
                                rend="italic">assume</hi> to have formed (“prétendent former”) a
                            separate confederation. These principles are substantially the same as
                            those set forth in my despatch No. 5, and, if they are thoroughly
                            carried out by this government, I do not see that much danger can arise
                            to our commerce from French subjects, or any facilities afforded by
                            French ports. Indeed, if the insurrectionists of the south are
                            recognized as belligerents, I do not see how we can justly ask or expect
                            the French government to go further against the pretended confederacy
                            than it has gone in this declaration. That part of the declaration which
                            puts the vessels of the United States in the same category as the
                            vessels of the Confederate States, may, I think, be justly complained
                            of; but this grows almost necessarily out of the recognition of those
                            States as belligerents. France has placed upon their rights as
                            belligerents (as it seems to me) the utmost limitation that she could
                            put <pb n="223" xml:id="pg_223" facs="0223"/> upon them, consistently
                            with the recognition of such rights at all. She has done this, moreover,
                            without offensive promulgation of sympathy with the southern rebels
                            either upon the part of the government or its statesmen, but with
                            expressions of kindness and respect for us throughout.</p>
                        <p>I have not yet received from Mr. Thouvenel an answer to my written
                            proposition to open negotiations for the accession of the United States
                            to the treaty of Paris of 1856. A copy of that written proposition,
                            marked A, is hereunto attached.</p>
                        <p>The European press, so far as I have observed, take it for granted that
                            the accession of the United States to that treaty would not at all alter
                            the relations of the several powers to the so-called southern
                            confederacy. A treaty cannot of itself alter the law of nations,
                            although it may restrict the rights of those States which become parties
                            to it. The treaty of Paris certainly did not prevent the United States,
                            while no party to it, from issuing letters of marque, nor would the
                            accession of the United States to such treaty prevent the confederates
                            of the south from doing the same thing if they are recognized by other
                            nations as a belligerent power. The whole difficulty, every subsequent
                            right which has been conceded to the confederates, grows out of that
                            recognition.</p>
                        <p>It is doubtful, perhaps, whether the other powers will, under the
                            circumstances, negotiate for the accession of the United States at this
                            time to the treaty in question; but should they do so, it will be with
                            the understanding, I take it, that it imposes no new duties upon them
                            growing out of our domestic controversy. I beg pardon, however, for
                            these suggestions. They may, perhaps, be considered a little beyond the
                            line of my official duties.</p>

                                the plenipotentiaries of France, Great Britain, Austria, Prussia,
                                Russia, Sardinia, and Turkey, at Paris, on the 16th of April, 1856,
                                with the addition to the first clause, which declares “privateering
                                is and remains abolished,” of the following words: “And the private
                                property of the subjects or citizens of a belligerent on the high
                                seas shall be exempted from seizure by public armed vessels of the

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Every instruction which this government
                            has given to its representatives abroad, since the recent change of
                            administration took place, has expressed our profound anxiety lest the
                            disloyal citizens who are engaged in an attempt to overthrow the Union
                            should obtain aid and assistance from foreign nations, either in the
                            form of a recognition of their pretended sovereignty, or in some other
                            and more qualified or guarded manner. Every instruction has expressed
                            our full belief that, without such aid or assistance, the insurrection
                            would speedily come to an end, while any advantage that it could derive
                            from such aid or assistance could serve no other purpose than to
                            protract the existing struggle and aggravate the evils it is inflicting
                            on our own country and on foreign and friendly nations. Every
                            instruction bears evidence of an earnest solicitude to avoid even an
                            appearance of menace or of want of comity towards foreign powers; but at
                            the same time it has emphatically announced, as is now seen to have been
                            necessary, our purpose not to allow any one of them to expect to remain
                            in friendship with us if it should, with whatever motive, practically
                            render such aid or assistance to the insurgents. We have intended not to
                            leave it doubtful that a concession of sovereignty to the insurgents,
                            though it should be indirect or unofficial, or though it should be
                            qualified so as to concede only belligerent or other partial rights,
                            would be regarded as inconsistent with the relations due to us by
                            friendly nations. Nor has it been left at all uncertain that we shall,
                            in every event, insist that these United States must be considered and
                            dealt with now, as heretofore, by such nations as exclusively sovereign
                            for all purposes whatsoever within the territories over which the
                            Constitution has been extended. On the other hand we have not, at any
                            time, been unmindful of the peculiar circumstances which might excite
                            apprehensions on the part of commercial nations for the safety of their
                            subjects and their property in the conflicts which might occur upon sea
                            as well as on land between the forces of the United States and those of
                            the insurgents.</p>
                        <p>The United States have never disclaimed the employment of letters of
                            marque as a means of maritime war. The insurgents early announced their
                            intention to commission privateers. We knew that friendly nations would
                            be anxious for guarantees of safety from injury by that form of
                            depredation upon the national commerce. We knew also that such nations
                            would desire to be informed whether their flags should be regarded as
                            protecting goods, not contraband of war, of disloyal citizens, found
                            under them, and whether the goods, not contraband, of subjects of such
                            nations would be safe from confiscation when found in vessels of
                            disloyal citizens of the United States. This administration, free from
                            some of the complications of those which had preceded it, promptly took
                            up the negotiations relating to the declaration of the congress of
                            Paris, just at the point where they had been suspended by President
                            Buchanan. We found it just and humane in itself so far as it goes, and
                            that it had only failed to be accepted by the United States because
                            foreign nations had refused to accept an additional principle proposed
                            by this government, yet more just and humane than any which it does
                            contain, namely, that the property of private citizens, not contraband,
                            should be exempted from confiscation in maritime war. While still
                            willing and desirous to have that further principle incorporated in the
                            law of nations, we nevertheless instructed you, and all our
                            representatives in foreign countries, to waive it, if necessary, and to
                            stipulate, subject to the concurrence <pb n="225" xml:id="pg_225"
                                facs="0225"/> of the Senate of the United States, our adhesion to
                            the declaration of the congress of Paris as a whole and unmodified. This
                            was done so early as the 25th day of April last, long before the date of
                            the instructions which Mr. Mercier proposed to submit to us. We have
                            ever since that time been waiting for the responses of foreign powers to
                            this high and liberal demonstration on our part. We have, however,
                            received no decisive answers on the subject from those powers.</p>
                        <p>It was under these circumstances that on the fifteenth day of June
                            instant, the minister from France and the minister from Great Britain,
                            having previously requested an interview, were received by me. Each of
                            them announced that he was charged by his government to read a despatch
                            to me and to give me a copy if I should desire it.</p>
                        <p>I answered that, owing to the peculiar circumstances of the times, I
                            could not consent to an official reading or delivery of these papers
                            without first knowing their characters and objects. They confidentially
                            and with entire frankness put the despatches into my hands for an
                            informal preliminary examination. Having thus become possessed of their
                            characters, I replied to those ministers that I could not allow them to
                            be officially communicated to this government. They will doubtless
                            mention this answer to their respective states.</p>
                        <p>I give you now the reasons of this government for pursuing this course in
                            regard to the despatch from France, that you may communicate them to the
                            French government, if you shall find it necessary or expedient.</p>
                        <p>Some time ago we learned through our legation at St. Petersburg that an
                            understanding had been effected between the governments of Great Britain
                            and France that they should take one and the same course on the subject
                            of the political disturbances in this country, including the possible
                            recognition of the insurgents. At a later period this understanding was
                            distinctly avowed by Mr. Thouvenel to Mr. Sanford, who had been
                            informally introduced by me to the French minister for foreign affairs,
                            and by Lord John Russell to Mr. Dallas, our late minister in London. The
                            avowal in each case preceded the arrival of our newly appointed
                            ministers in Europe, with their instructions for the discharge of their
                            respective missions.</p>
                        <p>On receiving their avowals I immediately instructed yourself and Mr.
                            Adams “that although we might have expected a different course on the
                            part of these two great powers, yet, as the fact that an understanding
                            existed between them did not certainly imply an unfriendly spirit, we
                            should not complain of it, but that it must be understood fey the French
                            and British governments that we shall deal hereafter, as heretofore, in
                            this case, as in all others, with each power separately, and that the
                            agreement for concerted action between them would not at all influence
                            the course we should pursue.” The concert thus avowed has been carried
                            out. The ministers came to me together; the instructions they proposed
                            to me differ in form, but are counter parts in effect.</p>
                        <p>Adhering to our previous decision, which before this time has doubtless
                            been made known to the government of France, we do not make this
                            concert, under the circumstances, a reason for declining to hear the
                            instruction, with which Mr. Mercier is charged.</p>
                        <p>That paper does not expressly deny the sovereignty of the United States
                            of America, but it does assume, inconsistently with that sovereignty,
                            that the United States are not altogether and for all purposes one
                            sovereign power, but that this nation consists of two parties, of which
                            this government is one. France proposes to take cognizance of both
                            parties as belligeents, and for some purposes to hold communication with
                            each. The instruction would advise us indeed that we must not be
                            surprised if France shall address herself to a government which she says
                            is to be installed, at <pb n="226" xml:id="pg_226" facs="0226"/>
                            Montgomery, for certain explanations. This intimation is conclusive in
                            determining this government not to allow the instruction to be read to
                            it.</p>
                        <p>The United States rightly jealous, as we think, of their sovereignty,
                            cannot suffer themselves to debate any abridgement of that sovereignty
                            with France or with any other nation. Much less can it consent that
                            France shall announce to it a conclusion of her own against that
                            sovereignty, which conclusion France has adopted without any previous
                            conference with the United States on the subject. This government
                            insists that the United States are one whole undivided nation,
                            especially so far as foreign nations are concerned, and that France is,
                            by the law of nations and by treaties, not a neutral power between two
                            imaginary parties here, but a friend of the United States.</p>
                        <p>In the spirit of this understanding of the case, we are not only not
                            wishing to seek or to give offence to France, but, on the contrary, we
                            desire to preserve peace and friendship with that great power, as with
                            all other nations. We do not feel at liberty to think, and do not think,
                            that France intended any want of consideration towards the United States
                            in directing that the instruction in question should be read to us.
                            Outside of that paper we have abundant evidence of the good feeling and
                            good wishes of the Emperor, and even his anxious solicitude for the same
                            consummation which is the supreme object of our own desires and labors,
                            namely, the preservation of the American Union in its full and absolute
                            integrity.</p>
                        <p>Doubtless the proceeding has been the result of inadvertence. We feel
                            ourselves at liberty to think that it would not have occurred if we had
                            been so fortunate as to have been heard through you in the consultations
                            of the French government. We think we can easily see how the
                            inadvertence has occurred. France seems to have mistaken a mere casual
                            and ephemeral insurrection here, such as is incidental in the experience
                            of all nations, because all nations are merely human societies, such as
                            have sometimes happened in the history of France herself, for a war
                            which has flagrantly separated this nation into two co-existing
                            political powers which are contending in arms against each other after
                            the separation.</p>
                        <p>It is erroneous, so far as foreign nations are concerned, to suppose that
                            any war exists in the United States. Certainly there cannot be two
                            belligerent powers where there is no war. There is here, as there has
                            always been, one political power, namely, the United States of America,
                            competent to make war and peace, and conduct commerce and alliances with
                            all foreign nations. There is none other, either in fact, or recognized
                            by foreign nations. There is, indeed, an armed sedition seeking to
                            overthrow the government, and the government is employing military and
                            naval forces to repress it. But these facts do not constitute a war
                            presenting two belligerent powers, and modifying the national character,
                            rights, and responsibilities, or the characters, rights, and
                            responsibilities of foreign nations. It is true that insurrection may
                            ripen into revolution, and that revolution thus ripened may extinguish a
                            previously existing State, or divide it into one or more independent
                            States, and that if such States continue their strife after such
                            division, then there exists a state of war affecting the characters,
                            rights, and duties of all parties concerned. But this only happens when
                            the revolution has run its successful course.</p>
                        <p>The French government says, in the instruction which has been tendered to
                            us, that certain facts which it assumes confer upon the insurgents of
                            this country, in the eyes of foreign powers, all the appearances of a
                            government <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi>, wherefore, whatever may be
                            its regrets, the French government must consider the two contending
                            parties as employing the forces at their disposal in conformity with the
                            laws of war.</p>
                        <p>This statement assumes not only that the law of nations entitles any <pb
                                n="227" xml:id="pg_227" facs="0227"/> insurrectionary faction, when
                            it establishes a <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> government, to be
                            treated as a belligerent, but also that the fact of the attainment of
                            this status is to be determined by the appearance of it in the eyes of
                            foreign nations. If we should concede both of these positions, we should
                            still insist that the existence of a <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi>
                            government, entitled to belligerent rights, is not established in the
                            present case. We have already heard from most of the foreign nations.
                            There are only two which seem so to construe appearances, and France is
                            one of them. Are the judgments of these two to outweigh those of all
                            other nations? Doubtless each nation may judge and act for itself, but
                            it certainly cannot expect the United States to accept its decision upon
                            a question vital to their national existence. The United States will not
                            refine upon the question when and how new nations are born out of
                            existing nations. They are well aware that the rights of the States
                            involve their duties and their destinies, and they hold those rights to
                            be absolute as against all foreign nations. These rights do not at all
                            depend on the appearances which their condition may assume in the eyes
                            of foreign nations, whether strangers, neutrals, friends, or even
                            allies. The United States will maintain and defend their sovereignty
                            throughout the bounds of the republic, and they deem all other nations
                            bound to respect that sovereignty until, if ever, Providence shall
                            consent that it shall be successfully overthrown. Any system of public
                            law or national morality that conflicts with this would resolve society,
                            first in this hemisphere and then in the other, into anarchy and
                            chaos.</p>
                        <p>This government is sensible of the importance of the step it takes in
                            declining to hear the communication the tender of which has drawn out
                            these explanations. It believes, however, that it need not disturb the
                            good relations which have so long and so happily subsisted between the
                            United States and France.</p>
                        <p>The paper, as understood, while implying a disposition on the part of
                            France to accord belligerent rights to the insurgents, does not name,
                            specify, or even indicate one such belligerent right. On the other hand,
                            the rights which it asserts that France expects, as a neutral, from the
                            United States, as a belligerent, are even less than this government, on
                            the 25th of April, instructed you to concede and guaranty to her by
                            treaty, as a friend. On that day we offered to her our adhesion to the
                            declaration of Paris, which contains four propositions, namely: 1st.
                            That privateering shall be abolished. 2d. That a neutral flag covers
                            enemy’s goods not contraband of war. 3d. That goods of a neutral, not
                            contraband, shall not be confiscated though found in an enemy’s vessel.
                            4th. That blockades, in order to be lawful, must be maintained by
                            competent force. We have always, when at war, conceded the three last of
                            these rights to neutrals, <hi rend="italic">a fortiori</hi>, we could
                            not when at peace deny them to friendly nations. The first-named
                            concession was proposed on the grounds already mentioned. We are still
                            ready to guarantee these rights, by convention with France, whenever she
                            shall authorize either you or her minister here to enter into
                            convention. There is no reservation or difficulty about their
                            application in the present case. We hold all the citizens of the United
                            States, loyal or disloyal, alike included by the law of nations and
                            treaties; and we hold ourselves bound by the same obligations to see, so
                            far as may be in our power, that all our citizens, whether maintaining
                            this government or engaged in overthrowing it, respect those rights in
                            favor of France and of every other friendly nation. In any case, not
                            only shall we allow no privateer or national vessel to violate the
                            rights of friendly nations as I have thus described them, but we shall
                            also employ all our naval force to prevent the insurgents from violating
                            them just as much as we do to prevent them from violating the laws of
                            our own country.</p>
                        <pb n="228" xml:id="pg_228" facs="0228"/>
                        <p>What, then, does France claim of us that we do not accord to her?
                            Nothing. What do we refuse to France by declining to receive the
                            communication sent to us through the hands of Mr. Mercier? Nothing but
                            the privilege of telling us that we are at war, when we maintain we are
                            at peace, and that she is a neutral, when we prefer to recognize her as
                            a friend.</p>
                        <p>Of course, it is understood that on this occasion we reserve, as on all
                            others, our right to suppress the insurrection by naval as well as by
                            military power, and for that purpose to close such of our ports as have
                            fallen or may fall into the hands of the insurgents, either directly or
                            in the more lenient and equitable form of a blockade, which for the
                            present we have adopted. It is thus seen that there is no practical
                            subject of difference between the two governments. The United States
                            will hope that France will not think it necessary to adhere to and
                            practice upon the speculation concerning the condition of our internal
                            affairs which she has proposed to communicate to us. But however this
                            may be, the United States will not anticipate any occasion for a change
                            of the relations which, with scarcely any interruption, have existed
                            between the two nations for three-quarters of a century, and have been
                            very instrumental in promoting, not merely the prosperity and greatness
                            of each State, but the cause of civil and religious liberty and free
                            institutions throughout the world.</p>
                        <p>This government understands equally the interest of friendly nations and
                            its own in the present emergency. If they shall not interfere, the
                            attempt at revolution here will cease without inflicting serious evils
                            upon foreign nations. All that they can do by any interference, with a
                            view to modify our action, will only serve to prolong the present
                            unpleasant condition of things, and possibly to produce results that
                            would be as universally calamitous as they would be irretrievable.</p>
                        <p>The case, as it now stands, is the simple, ordinary one that has happened
                            at all times and in all countries. A discontented domestic faction seeks
                            foreign intervention to overthrow the Constitution and the liberties of
                            its own country. Such intervention, if yielded, is ultimately disastrous
                            to the cause it is designed to aid. Every uncorrupted nation, in its
                            deliberate moments, prefers its own integrity, even with unbearable
                            evils, to division through the power or influence of any foreign State.
                            This is so in France. It is not less so in this country. Down deep in
                            the heart of the American people—deeper than the love of trade, or of
                            freedom—deeper than the attachment to any local or sectional interest,
                            or partizan pride or individual ambition—deeper than any other
                            sentiment—is that one out of which the Constitution of this Union arose,
                            namely, American independence—independence of all foreign control,
                            alliance, or influence. Next above it lies the conviction that neither
                            peace, nor safety, nor public liberty, nor prosperity, nor greatness,
                            nor empire, can be attained here with the sacrifice of the unity of the
                            people of North America. Those who, in a frenzy of passion, are building
                            expectations on other principles do not know what they are doing.
                            Whenever one part of this Union shall be found assuming bonds of
                            dependence or of fraternity towards any foreign people, to the exclusion
                            of the sympathies of their native land, then, even if not before, that
                            spirit will be reawakened which brought the States of this republic into
                            existence, and which will preserve them united until the common destiny
                            which it opened to them shall be fully and completely realized.</p>

                            of war seems to have been judicious. If the War Department should find
                            need for the latter, it will commission proper agents. As for the
                            former, the offers for military service, and by our own citizens,
                            surpass equally our calls and our needs. Colonel Frémont’s purchases are
                            thankfully approved, and the drafts of yourself and Mr. Adams, mentioned
                            by you, will be accepted. The President expresses great satisfaction
                            with the promptness and decision manifested by you in the matter.</p>
                        <p>We wish to act singly and in good faith with the French government. We
                            understand, and shall continue to understand, that France does not
                            concede belligerent rights to the insurgents in contravention of our
                            sovereignty. We shall insist that she does nothing adverse to our
                            position, whatever may be <hi rend="italic">said</hi> to the
                            contrary.</p>
                        <p>She has proposed to tell us that she thinks the confederate States are
                            entitled to belligerent rights. We have declined to hear that. We have
                            not heard it. We shall continue to regard France as respecting our
                            government, throughout the whole country, until she <hi rend="italic"
                                >practically acts in violation of her friendly obligations</hi> to
                            us, as we understand them. When she does <hi rend="italic">that</hi>, it
                            will be time enough to inquire whether, if we accede to the treaty of
                            Paris, she could, after that, allow pirates upon our commerce shelter in
                            her ports; and what our remedy then should be. We have no fear on this
                            head.</p>
                        <p>We are dealing now as a nation at peace with France as a friend. We have
                            told her that we shall not consent to her change of this relation.</p>
                        <p>She knows, distinctly, if she accepts our adhesion to the declaration of
                            the congress of Paris, the ground on which it is given by us.</p>
                        <p>While saying this, however, we also confess that our solicitude on the
                            subject is not so intense now, since the responsibility for the next
                            step remains with France and not with us.</p>
                        <p>Still we wish you to act directly and frankly, being always ready to
                            perform all we have offered.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to enclose to you a copy
                            of the reply of Mr. Thouvenel to my proposition, on the part of the
                            United States, to open negotiations for its accession to the treaty of
                            Paris of 1856, according to the terms therein stated.</p>
                        <p>In our first conversation upon this subject, I understood from Mr.
                            Thouvenel <pb n="230" xml:id="pg_230" facs="0230"/> that on a written
                            proposition from me for negotiation he would address the other powers
                            (parties to the treaty) upon the subject. That a note from me would
                            afford him a starting point for communicating with such powers. Upon
                            further reflection, or upon conference with his associates in the
                            government, he now writes that it will be necessary that I address
                            myself jointly (if I understood him rightly) to all the powers
                            associated in that treaty, before my proposition can be considered.</p>
                        <p>Our condition as respects privateering and the belligerent rights
                            conceded to the south has been so changed by the action of Great
                            Britain, France and Spain, subsequent to the first declaration of Lord
                            John Russelll, (stating that such belligerent rights would be conceded,)
                            that I know not what may be the views of the government of the United
                            States at this time as respects an accession to the treaty of 1856, pure
                            and simple. But as I have learned that nothing substantially has been
                            done in that direction at other points, and I do not see that the
                            interests of the country will be jeoparded by a little delay, I shall
                            await further instructions upon this subject. My first despatch
                            referring to this matter was dated 22d of May last, and I doubt not I
                            shall now receive an answer at an early day. If the government of the
                            United States shall, in view of the circumstances, direct me to make the
                            proposition to the French government to accede to the Paris treaty, pure
                            and simple, I will, acting under such express direction, lose no time in
                            making the proposition. * * * * * *</p>

                            in this respect is happily confirmed in even more emphatic language by
                            the communication which Mr. Mercier has made to us to-day under

                            mischievous paragraph in the <hi rend="italic">Moniteur</hi>, because it
                            has drawn out renewed and most satisfactory assurances of the friendly

                            it is but just to ourselves that you shall now inform Mr. Thouvenel that
                            it is our settled habit never to overhear what the press, or the
                            ministers, or even the monarch of a foreign country with which we are in
                            amity, says concerning us, and never to ask any explanations so long as
                            such observations are not directly communicated by the government itself
                            to us, and it, at the same time, discharges all its customary functions
                            without hostility or injury to us. Our reasons for this are that we
                            know, first, there are state necessities which do not always permit, in
                            any country, the practice of entire frankness concerning foreign
                            questions; secondly, that unguarded and inconsiderate expressions, even
                            by persons in high authority, ought not to disturb established and
                            harmonious relations between friendly nations; and, thirdly, that we
                            know that the maintenance of our rights and character depend, as they
                            ought, chiefly on our own fidelity to ourselves, and very little on the
                            favorable opinion of even the most candid and liberal nations.
                            Friendship towards, and confidence in, the good will of France towards
                            us are settled habits of mind on the part of the American people. If
                            anything is hastily written or spoken on either side that would seem to
                            indicate a different sentiment, it is wise to let it pass without
                            sensibility, and certainly without querulous animadversion.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Burlingame will, before this time, have been advised of his
                            appointment as minister to China. His delay at Paris is approved in
                            consideration of the peculiar circumstances of the case.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your despatch No 12 (dated June 22) has
                            been received. It relates to our proposition for accession to the
                            declaration of Paris. This <pb n="232" xml:id="pg_232" facs="0232"/>
                            affair has become very much complicated, by reason of the irregular and
                            extraordinary proceeding of the French government in proposing to take
                            notice of the domestic disturbance which has occurred in this country. I
                            do not know that even now I can clear the matter up effectually without
                            knowing what may be the result of the communication which, in my
                            despatch No. 19, I instructed you to make to the French government. I
                            will try, nevertheless, to do so. The instructions contained in my
                            despatch No. 4, dated 24th of April last, required you to tender to the
                            French government, without delay, our adhesion to the declaration of the
                            congress of Paris, pure and simple.</p>
                        <p>The reason why we wished it done immediately was, that we supposed the
                            French government would naturally feel a deep anxiety about the safety
                            of their commerce, threatened distinctly with privateering by the
                            insurgents, while at the same time, as this government had heretofore
                            persistently declined to relinquish the right of issuing letters of
                            marque, it would be apprehended by France that we too should take up
                            that form of maritime warfare in the present domestic controversy. We
                            apprehended that the danger of such a case of depredation upon commerce
                            equally by the government itself, and by its enemies, would operate as a
                            provocation to France and other commercial nations to recognize the
                            insurrectionary party in violation of our national rights and
                            sovereignty. On the contrary, we did not desire to depredate on friendly
                            commerce ourselves, and we thought it our duty to prevent such
                            depredations by the insurgents by executing our own laws, which make
                            privateering by disloyal citizens piracy, and punish its pursuit as
                            such. We thought it wise, just, and prudent to give, unasked, guarantees
                            to France and other friendly nations for the security of their commerce
                            from exposure to such depredations on either side, at the very moment
                            when we were delivering to them our protest against the recognition of
                            the insurgents. The accession to the declaration of Paris would be the
                            form in which these guarantees could be given—that for obvious reasons
                            must be more unobjectionable to France and to other commercial nations
                            than any other. It was safe on our part, because we tendered it, of
                            course, as the act of this federal government, to be obligatory equally
                            upon disloyal as upon loyal citizens.</p>
                        <p>The instructions waived the Marcy, amendment, (which proposed to exempt
                            private property from confiscation in maritime war,) and required you to
                            propose our accession to the declaration of the congress of Paris, pure
                            and simple. These were the reasons for this course, namely: First. It
                            was as well understood by this government then, as it is now by
                            yourself, that an article of that celebrated declaration prohibits every
                            one of the parties to it from negotiating upon the subject of neutral
                            rights in maritime warfare with any nation not a party to it, except for
                            the adhesion of such outstanding party to the declaration of the
                            congress of Paris, pure and simple. An attempt to obtain an acceptance
                            of Mr. Marcy’s amendment would require a negotiation not merely with
                            France alone, but with all the other original parties of the congress of
                            Paris, and every government that has since acceded to the declaration.
                            Nay, more: we must obtain their unanimous consent to the amendment
                            before being able to commit ourselves or to engage any other nation,
                            however well disposed, to commit itself to us on the propositions
                            actually contained in the declaration. On the other hand, each nation
                            which is a party to the declaration of Paris is at liberty to stipulate
                            singly with us for acceptance of that declaration for the government of
                            our neutral relations. If, therefore, we should waive the Marcy
                            proposition, or leave it for ultimate consideration, we could establish
                            a complete agreement between ourselves and France on a subject which, if
                            it should be left open, <pb n="233" xml:id="pg_233" facs="0233"/> might
                            produce consequences very much to be deprecated. It is almost
                            unnecessary to say that what we proposed to France was equally and
                            simultaneously proposed to every other maritime power. In this way we
                            expected to remove every cause that any foreign power could have for the
                            recognition of the insurgents as a belligerent power.</p>
                        <p>The matter stood in this plain and intelligible way until certain
                            declarations or expressions of the French government induced you to
                            believe that they would recognize and treat the insurgents as a distinct
                            national power for belligerent purposes. It was not altogether
                            unreasonable that you, being at Paris, should suppose that this
                            government would think itself obliged to acquiesce in such a course by
                            the government of France. So assuming, you thought that we would not
                            adhere to our proposition to accede to the declaration, pure and simple,
                            since such a course would, as you thought, be effective to bind this
                            government without binding the insurgents, and would leave France at
                            liberty to hold us bound, and the insurgents free from the obligations
                            created by our adhesion. Moreover, if we correctly understand your
                            despatch on that subject, you supposed that you might propose our
                            adhesion to the treaty of Paris, not pure and simple, but with the
                            addition of the Marcy proposition in the first instance, and might
                            afterwards, in case of its being declined in that form, withdraw the
                            addition, and then propose our accession to the declaration of Paris,
                            pure and simple.</p>
                        <p>While you were acting on these views on your side of the Atlantic, we on
                            this side, not less confident in our strength than in our rights, as you
                            are now aware, were acting on another view, which is altogether
                            different, namely, that we shall not acquiesce in any declaration of the
                            government of France that assumes that this government is not now, as it
                            always has been, exclusive sovereign, for war as well as for peace,
                            within the States and Territories of the federal Union, and over all
                            citizens, the disloyal and loyal all alike. We treat in that character,
                            which is our legal character, or we do not treat at all, and we in no
                            way consent to compromise that character in the least degree; we do not
                            even suffer this character to become the subject of discussion. Good
                            faith and honor, as well as the same expediency which prompted the
                            proffer of our accession to the declaration of Paris, pure and simple,
                            in the first instance, now require us to adhere to that proposition and
                            abide by it; and we do adhere to it, not, however, as a divided, but as
                            an undivided nation. The proposition is tendered to France not as a
                            neutral but as a friend, and the agreement is to be obligatory upon the
                            United States and France and all their legal dependencies just
                            alike.</p>
                        <p>The case was peculiar, and in the aspect in which it presented itself to
                            you portentous. We were content that you might risk the experiment, so,
                            however, that you should not bring any responsibility for delay upon
                            this government. But you now see that by incorporating the Marcy
                            amendment in your proposition, you have encountered the very difficulty
                            which was at first foreseen by us. The following nations are parties to
                            the declaration of Paris, namely: Baden, Bavaria, Belgium, Bremen,
                            Brazils, Duchy of Brunswick, Chili, the Argentine Confederation, the
                            Germanic Confederation, Denmark, the two Sicilies, the Republic of the
                            Equator, the Roman States, Greece, Guatemala, Hayti, Hamburgh, Hanover,
                            the two Hesses, Lubeck, Mecklenburgh Strelitz, Mecklenburgh Schwerin,
                            Nassau, Oldenburgh, Parma, Holland, Peru, Portugal, Saxony, Saxe
                            Altenburgh, Saxe Coburg Gotha, Saxe Meiningen, Saxe Weimar, Sweden,
                            Switzerland, Tuscany, Wurtemburg, Anhault Dessau, Modena, New Granada,
                            and Uruguay.</p>
                        <pb n="234" xml:id="pg_234" facs="0234"/>
                        <p>The great exigency in our affairs will have passed away—for preservation
                            or destruction of the American Union—before we could bring all these
                            nations to unanimity on the subject, as you have submitted it to Mr.
                            Thouvenel. It is a time not for propagandism, but for energetic acting
                            to arrest the worst of all national calamities. We therefore expect you
                            now to renew the proposition in the form originally prescribed. But in
                            doing this you will neither unnecessarily raise a question about the
                            character in which this government acts, (being exclusive sovereign,)
                            nor, on the other hand, in any way compromise that character in any
                            degree. Whenever such a question occurs to hinder you, let it come up
                            from the other party in the negotiation. It will be time then to stop
                            and wait for such further instructions as the new exigency may
                            require.</p>
                        <p>One word more. You will, in any case, avow our preference for the
                            proposition with the Marcy amendment incorporated, and will assure the
                            government of France that whenever there shall be any hope for the
                            adoption of that beneficent feature by the necessary parties, as a
                            principle of the law of nations, we shall be ready not only to agree to
                            it, but even to propose it, and to lead in the necessary
                            negotiations.</p>
                        <p>This paper is, in one view, a conversation merely between yourself and
                            us. It is not to be made public. On the other hand, we confide in your
                            discretion to make such explanations as will relieve yourself of
                            embarrassments, and this government of any suspicion of inconsistency or
                            indirection in its intercourse with the enlightened and friendly
                            government of France.</p>

                        <p>Since writing the above I have received your despatches, Nos. 12, 19, and
                            20. I infer, from the contents of No. 19, that Mr. Mercier is aware of
                            your original instructions to me on the subject of an accession to the
                            treaty of Paris of 1856, and that you hold yourself open to negotiate
                            with him there on that subject. As Mr. Adams has referred this question
                            back to be treated of at Washington, and it is evident, I think, that
                            Great Britain and France will act upon advisement at least with each
                            other, it seems to me that it will be more convenient, in every respect,
                            that you should take charge of the whole question at Washington, rather
                            than have it dealt with by different persons, at the same time, each
                            ignorant to a great extent of the action of the other. Besides, it is
                            due to frankness to say that, if a convention is to be negotiated for an
                            accession by the United States to the treaty of Paris, without amendment
                            to the first clause, I would prefer it should be done at Washington
                            rather than Paris. Still, I hold myself subject to the orders of the
                            government in this as in other matters. I have already said I should
                            await further instructions from your department on this subject.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your despatches, Nos. 24 and 25, are duly
                            received. Despatches 19, 22, and 24, treat in whole or in part of the
                            same general matter.</p>
                        <p>I have read despatch No. 19 with great interest. It had not occurred to
                            me that you might deny to France and Great Britain an official reading
                            of their despatches which announced to our government their concession
                            of belligerent rights to the south; or that, if you should do so, it
                            would alter the relations of parties to the question. If it has that
                            effect diplomatically, or relieves you from noticing their position, you
                            were certainly right. Indeed, I cannot see how, upon the ground that you
                            put the matter, France has just cause of offence. You say merely you
                            want no notice of a <hi rend="italic">purpose</hi> by her to do what you
                            consider an unfriendly act; that you will wait until the act is done
                            before you choose to notice it; that, in other words, you choose to
                            consider her as a friend until she shows herself by acts, not words, to
                            be the contrary. * * * * * *</p>
                        <p>The reasons assigned for your course you say I may communicate to the
                            French government if I “shall find it necessary or expedient.” I shall
                            not fail to avail myself of this authority upon the earliest opportunity
                            which shall be afforded for doing so. The just reasoning and friendly
                            tone of your despatch will be invaluable for justification of your
                            course and the prevention of difficulties. Unless, however, they refer
                            to your action or make it a subject of complaint, it is, I suppose, not
                            expedient for me to volunteer explanations. I was much surprised by one
                            fact found in the despatch from the French government left with you for
                            an informal reading, to wit: that you must not be surprised if France
                            should address herself to a government which she says is to be installed
                            at Montgomery for certain explanations. I could not have anticipated,
                            from what had been said to me here, that such a course was in
                            contemplation. Should they adopt it, the act would seem to me to
                            approximate a recognition in this instance of the southern government
                            more nearly than anything that has yet occurred. In that event, your
                            future course will, no doubt, be guided by that wisdom which is so
                            essential to carry us through the troubles of our present position. * *

                            note from Mr. Adams, a copy of which, marked A, is hereunto annexed,
                            apprising me that, under renewed instructions from the government at
                            Washington, he had proposed to the British government, on the 11th of
                            this month, to negotiate on the basis of the project which had been
                            transmitted to him soon after his arrival at London, touching the four
                            points of the declaration of the convention at Paris in 1856, and
                            inquiring whether I felt empowered and disposed to remove the obstacle
                            of delay by entering at once into an arrangement for simultaneous action
                            with the Emperor of the French. Accompanying his note was the copy of a
                            communication from Lord John Russell, dated July 18, 1861, of which I
                            send a copy, (though I doubt not Mr. Adams has anticipated me in doing
                            so.) Feeling the great importance of this matter, and mindful of your
                            request that we should confer together when we could, I immediately went
                            over to London.</p>
                        <p>I found, by the date of your renewed instructions to Mr. Adams, that you
                            did not intend the negotiation upon this question should be conducted at
                            Washington, but that it should be done on this side; and further, that
                            with a full knowledge of all the facts, the original purpose of acceding
                            to the treaty of Paris of 1856 was adhered to. Under these
                            circumstances, I felt it my duty to say to Mr. Adams that there need be
                            no delay on my account. <pb n="237" xml:id="pg_237" facs="0237"/> To
                            facilitate matters, while I was yet in London I made to him, in writing,
                            a communication to that effect, of which I send you a copy, marked
                            B.</p>
                        <p>You will observe that I ask Mr. Adams, in this communication, whether
                            Great Britain has, at his instance, or otherwise, considered the Marcy
                            amendment? This was done after conference with him, and after he had
                            told me what would be his answer. He said that after I had made the
                            proposition here it was considered at London, and Lord John Russell,
                            upon his (Mr. Adams) suggesting this amendment to the treaty there, said
                            at once that the principle was inadmissible; that the British government
                            would not assent to it. This answer I thought it most desirable we
                            should have on record, and therefore made a suggestion in my note which
                            Mr. Adams said he would adopt. Great Britain, so far as I know, never
                            has, before this, distinctly placed herself on record against the
                            adoption of that humane and noble principle as a provision of maritime
                            law.</p>
                        <p>I was much gratified that I had gone over to London. I felt a sense of
                            relief in conferring with Mr. Adams upon questions of so much
                            importance, and got knowledge of some facts of which I had no knowledge
                            before. I was in England but two days, and then returned immediately to
                            Paris. I missed, however, the mail by the steamer of last week, which I
                            much regretted.</p>
                        <p>With much respect, your obedient servant,</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Upon considering your proposition of
                                Saturday last I have two remarks to make: <list>
                                    <label>1.</label>
                                    <item>The course hitherto followed has been a simple
                                        notification of adherence to the declaration of Paris by
                                        those states which were not originally parties to it.</item>
                                    <label>2.</label>
                                    <item>The declaration of Paris was one embracing various powers,
                                        with a view to general concurrence upon questions of
                                        maritime law, and not an insulated engagement between two
                                        powers only.</item>
                                </list></p>
                            <p>Her Majesty’s government are willing to waive entirely any objection
                                on the first of these heads, and to accept the form which the
                                government of the United States prefers.</p>
                            <p>With regard to the second, her Majesty’s government arc of opinion
                                that they should be assured that the United States are ready to
                                enter into a similar engagement with France, and with other maritime
                                powers, who are parties to the declaration of Paris, and do not
                                propose to make singly and separately a convention with Great
                                Britain only.</p>
                            <p>But as much time might be required for separate communications
                                between the government of the United States and all the maritime
                                powers who were parties to or have acceded to the declaration of
                                Paris, her Majesty’s government would deem themselves authorized to
                                advise the Queen to conclude a convention on this subject with the
                                President of the United States so soon as they shall have been
                                informed that a similar convention has been agreed upon, and is
                                ready for signature, between the President of the United States and
                                the Emperor of the French, so that the two conventions might be
                                signed simultaneously and on the same day.</p>
                            <p>I have the honor to be, with the highest consideration, sir, your
                                most obedient, humble servant,</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Yours of the 19th instant, enclosing a
                                copy of Lord John Russell’s of the 18th instant, was duly received
                                by me at Paris. My powers to negotiate with France an accession by
                                the United States to the treaty of Paris of 1856 are of the same
                                general character as your own. Under those powers and the
                                instructions received by me from Washington I did propose such
                                accession to the government of France, but with an addition to the
                                first clause of the following words: “And the private property of
                                subjects or citizens of one of the belligerents shall not be seized,
                                upon the high seas, by the vessels of war of the other belligerents,
                                unless it may be contraband of war.” To this proposition I received
                                an answer from the French minister of foreign affairs, dated June
                                20, 1861, the substance of which was that the French government
                                declined to consider the proposition (inasmuch as it differed from
                                the provisions of the treaty of Paris) unless it was addressed to
                                all the powers who were parties to that convention. In the meantime
                                I saw it stated in the public press of Europe that the British,
                                French, Spanish, and Belgian governments had made a declaration of
                                their intentions as respects their conduct towards the United States
                                government and the insurgents of the south, and I was not certain
                                whether our government would desire, under the circumstances, that
                                the proposition to accede to the treaty in question, without the
                                amendment, should be made.</p>
                            <p>Your renewed instructions to proceed on the basis of that treaty are
                                subsequent to and with a full knowledge by our government of the
                                facts hereinbefore stated.</p>
                            <p>Under these circumstances, therefore, I feel authorized and required
                                to proceed without further delay. Before, however, I shall
                                communicate further with the French government, I wish to know
                                whether Great Britain has, at your instance, or otherwise,
                                considered the amendment of the treaty hereinbefore referred to.
                                Before abandoning the hope of obtaining the incorporation, in our
                                code of maritime law, of that great and humane principle, it seems
                                to me desirable that we should have distinct assurance that the
                                principle will not be admitted. I do not recollect that Great
                                Britain has any time, heretofore, answered distinctly, if at all,
                                upon that proposition, but seems rather to have avoided it. I think
                                it desirable that that answer should be of record, (either in a note
                                from or to you,) so that the responsibility may attach, through all
                                time, where it properly belongs.</p>
                            <p>Immediately upon the receipt of your answer I will enclose a copy of
                                your notes, in connexion with that from Lord John Russell to the
                                French government, and, as soon as heard from, advise you of its
                                reply.</p>
                            <p>Respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I had the honor to inform your
                                excellency some time since that I was authorized, upon the part of
                                the United States, to treat with any person or persons authorized by
                                the Emperor concerning the principles of maritime law which affect
                                neutral and belligerent rights at sea, and other matters connected
                                therewith, of interest to the two nations, and on the 31st of May
                                last proposed to your excellency an accession by the United States
                                to the treaty of Paris of 1856, with certain words of addition
                                thereto.</p>
                            <p>Under date of 26th of June last I received a reply from your
                                excellency stating that the protocols of the congress of Paris
                                impose upon all the powers who signed the declaration of the 16th of
                                April the obligation not to negotiate, separately, upon the
                                application of maritime rights in time of war, any arrangement which
                                differed from the declaration resolved upon in common, and that, as
                                a consequence, it would be necessary that my offer include the other
                                powers signing the declaration before it would be considered.</p>
                            <p>At the time the foregoing offer was made I had some reason to believe
                                that it might be accepted by all the powers who negotiated that
                                treaty, but subsequent information (the nature of which I have
                                explained to you) has satisfied me that this was an error.</p>
                            <p>The government of the United States would have preferred the
                                incorporation in the treaty of the amendment before referred to; and
                                when there shall be any hope for the adoption of that beneficent
                                feature by the necessary parties as a principle of the law of
                                nations, the United States will not only be ready to agree to it,
                                but even to propose it, and to lead in the necessary
                                negotiations.</p>
                            <p>Under existing circumstances I am satisfied that I would not be
                                justified in further delaying negotiations for an accession by the
                                United States to the treaty of Paris of 1856, in the vain hope that
                                the amendment in question, if proposed to all the powers, would, at
                                present, be accepted. I have the honor, therefore, to apprise your
                                excellency that I am prepared, on the part of the government of the
                                United States, and hereby propose to your excellency, to enter into
                                a convention with the Emperor of the French for <pb n="240"
                                    xml:id="pg_240" facs="0240"/> accession by the United States to
                                the “declaration concerning maritime law” adopted by the
                                plenipotentiaries of France, Great Britain, Austria, Prussia,
                                Russia, Sardinia, and Turkey, at Paris, on the 16th of April, 1856,
                                and that I have special authority for this purpose from the
                                President of the United States, dated 26th of April last, which I
                                shall be happy to submit to your excellency. I beg likewise, in this
                                connexion, to say to your excellency that a like proposition has
                                been made by Mr. Adams to her Britannic Majesty, and herewith I deem
                                it proper to enclose you a copy of the reply of Lord John
                                Russell.</p>

                            Adams. These are of great interest, as they affect the question of our
                            blockade of the southern ports. I never think it wise to volunteer a
                            subject out of which complaints may arise before they are brought to my
                            notice by the party likely to complain; but should occasion arise, I
                            shall avail myself fully of the views suggested by you as to the purpose
                            and object of the late act of Congress authorizing the President to
                            close the ports by proclamation. But I very much fear that difficulties
                            will grow up between us and Great Britain and France upon this question.
                            Unless the ports are hermetically sealed by blockade, not by
                            proclamation—if these countries get short of cotton, and we are <hi

                            interior</hi>—excuses enough will be made for breaking the blockade. The
                            tone of the public press here indicates this; the private conversation

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: On Thursday of last week I was informed by
                            Lord Cowley that Mr. Adams and Lord John Russell had agreed upon the
                            text of a convention in respect to maritime rights, &amp;c. On the
                            following day a copy of this convention was sent to me by Lord Cowley. I
                            find it substantially, if not <pb n="242" xml:id="pg_242" facs="0242"/>
                            literally, the same as that which you enclosed to me, and directed me to
                            execute. I am to see Mr. Thouvenel upon the subject by appointment
                            to-morrow. Unless something shall occur, altering the existing condition
                            of things, this convention will doubtless be executed at an early day.
                            Your despatch No. 30 says, “the President is not impatient about the
                            negotiations concerning neutral rights,” but your prior despatches and
                            the action of Mr. Adams have put any considerable delay out of my power.
                            Besides, if the treaty is to be executed, whether it be done a few days
                            or weeks earlier or later is, perhaps, not very important. I have felt
                            much relieved in this negotiation by the specific character of my
                            instructions.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: My anticipations expressed in despatch No.
                            10 are fully realized. Both Lord John Russell and Mr. Thouvenel refuse
                            to negotiate for an accession by the United States to the treaty of
                            Paris of 1856, except on the distinct understanding that it is to have
                            no bearing, directly or indirectly, on the question of our southern or
                            domestic difficulty, and to render the matter certain they each propose
                            to make a written declaration simultaneous with the execution of the
                            convention, of which I herewith send you a copy and a translation. I
                            likewise send you a copy of Mr. Thouvenel’s note to me with its
                            translation.</p>
                        <p>I had an interview on Tuesday, the 20th instant, with Mr. Thouvenel by
                            appointment in reference to the subject matter of the convention, and
                            then he gave me the first notice of the purpose of the French government
                            to execute this outside declaration, predicated as it was, beyond all
                            doubt, upon a note he had just received from Lord John Russell, dated
                            only the day preceding He said that both France and Great Britain had
                            already announced that they would take no part in our domestic
                            controversy, and they thought that a frank and open declaration in
                            advance of the execution of this convention might save difficulty and
                            misconception hereafter. He further said, in the way of specification,
                            that the provisions of the treaty standing alone might bind England and
                            France to pursue and punish the privateers of the south as pirates. That
                            they were unwilling to do this, and had already so declared. He said
                            that we could deal with these people as we chose, and they could only
                            express their regrets on the score of humanity if we should deal with
                            them as pirates, but they could not participate in such a course. He
                            said, further, that although both England and France were anxious to
                            have the adhesion of the United States to the declaration of Paris, that
                            they would rather dispense with it altogether than be drawn into our
                            domestic controversy. He insisted somewhat pointedly that I could take
                            no just exception to this outside declaration, simultaneous with the
                            execution of the convention, unless we intended they should be made
                            parties to our controversy; and that the very fact of my hesitation was
                            an additional reason why they should insist upon making such
                            contemporaneous declaration. These are the general views expressed by
                            him.</p>
                        <p>In answer, I assented at once to the propriety of such declaration being
                            made in advance <hi rend="italic">if France and England did not mean to
                                abide by the terms of</hi>
                            <pb n="243" xml:id="pg_243" facs="0243"/>
                            <hi rend="italic">the treaty</hi>. I stated that I had no reason to
                            suppose that the United States desired to embroil these countries in our
                            domestic difficulties—that in point of fact our great desire had been
                            that they should keep out of them; but they proposed now to make a
                            declaration to accompany the execution of the convention which they
                            admitted would vary its obligations. That my instructions were to
                            negotiate that convention, and that I had no authority to do anything or
                            listen to anything which would waive any rights or relieve from any
                            obligation which might fairly arise from a just construction of its
                            terms. He said they did not mean to alter its terms, that it was not
                            like an addition of other provisions to the terms of the treaty itself.
                            To this I replied, that for the purpose intended, it was precisely the
                            same as if this declaration they proposed to make were to be
                            incorporated into the treaty itself. That its effect was to relieve them
                            (without complaint on our part) from compliance with one of the admitted
                            obligations of the treaty. I then told him I would consult with Mr.
                            Adams, and it was not improbable that we might feel ourselves under the
                            necessity of referring again to our government, to which he answered
                            that that must be a question for us to determine. In the course of our
                            conversation I told him that any declaration or action which looked to
                            or recognized a difference or distinction between the north and south
                            was a matter upon which our government was, under the circumstances,
                            peculiarly sensitive. That we treated with foreign governments for our
                            whole country, north and south, and for all its citizens, whether true
                            men or rebels, and when we could not so treat, we would cease to treat
                            at all. He answered that they did not mean to contest our right to treat
                            for the whole country, and that was not the purpose of the outside
                            declaration they proposed to make; but having heretofore adopted a
                            course of strict neutrality, the declaration in question was right and
                            proper to prevent misconception and controversy in the future.</p>
                        <p>After my conference with Mr. Thouvenel closed, I immediately wrote to Mr.
                            Adams, and suggested to him the propriety of either referring again to
                            our government for instructions, or, if he thought that such reference
                            would involve any unnecessary delay, then, at least, that at the time of
                            executing the convention (if it were executed) we should in like manner
                            make a counter declaration in writing, stating, in substance, that “we
                            have no power to admit, and do not mean to admit, that this outside
                            declaration by Great Britain and France is to relieve them, directly or
                            indirectly, from any obligation or duty which would otherwise devolve
                            upon them in virtue of said convention.”</p>
                        <p>I have felt constrained to make these suggestions to Mr. Adams, for I am
                            unwilling to act affirmatively in a matter of so much importance without
                            being clearly within my instructions. I shall await his answer before I
                            communicate further with the French government. With much respect, your
                            obedient servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Herewith I beg to enclose a copy of a
                            communication made by me to Mr. Thouvenel, in answer to his formal
                            notice of a purpose on the part of the French government to make an
                            outside declaration of its intentions at the time of the execution of
                            the treaty, copies of which were enclosed in despatch No. 35.</p>
                        <p>It is in part the same matter suggested to him by me in the conference in
                            which he first notified me of his purpose. His written communication
                            subsequent to that conference required a like formal reply. I am happy
                            to learn from a communication received from Mr. Adams that he concurs
                            with me in the propriety of stopping the negotiation where it is, and
                            referring the matter to the government at home. I should have been most
                            reluctant, under the circumstances, to execute this convention, had Mr.
                            Adams insisted upon it, making only a counter declaration, such as was
                            referred to in despateh No. 35; but I was very desirous, after what had
                            passed, not to be considered an obstacle in the way of carrying out the
                            wishes of the administration. I doubt now, however, if England and
                            France would themselves have assented to proceed with the execution of
                            the convention in the face of such declaration.</p>
                        <p>With much respect, I have the honor to be your obedient servant,</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Monsieur le Ministre</hi>: I have the honor to
                                acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 20th instant,
                                in which (carrying out the purpose expressed by you in our prior
                                conversation of that day) you communicate to me the text of a
                                written declaration which you propose to make simultaneous with the
                                execution of the convention between the United States and France, in
                                reference to the principles upon maritime rights proclaimed by the
                                Congress of Paris in 1856. You further suggest in your note that if
                                I were ready to sign the convention contemplated, we might be able
                                to agree to do so the same day when Lord Russell should proceed, on
                                his side, to the signing of a like convention with Mr. Adams</p>
                            <p>The declaration which you propose to make in writing, simultaneous
                                with the execution of the convention, has for its object, you say,
                                “to prevent all misunderstanding as to the nature of the engagements
                                which the government of the Emperor is disposed to contract,” and
                                this declaration is, that “in the execution of the orders of the
                                Emperor the government of his Majesty does not intend to undertake,
                                by said convention, any engagements of a nature to implicate it
                                directly or indirectly in the internal conflict now existing in the
                                United States.”</p>
                            <p>My impressions, hastily thrown out when this proposition was verbally
                                suggested, have been strengthened by subsequent reflection. I do not
                                stop to inquire how such outside declaration as you propose may
                                affect the rights or obligations of parties under the treaty.
                                Indeed, it is so general that it may not be possible to anticipate
                                its entire scope or operation. It gives us notice that the
                                engagements of your government are not to be “<hi rend="italic">of a
                                    nature</hi> to <hi rend="italic">implicate</hi> it directly or
                                    <hi rend="italic">indirectly</hi> in the internal conflict,”
                                &amp;c. It may be that the conduct of the government of France,
                                under this declaration, would practically extend no further than
                                would be agreeable to the United States; yet I cannot act upon such
                                assumption. My instructions are to negotiate a particular
                                convention, the text of which has been examined and approved, as I
                                understand, by your excellency. If the declaration which you propose
                                to make does not alter the obligations or duties which would
                                otherwise devolve upon France, in virtue of that convention, it is
                                useless to make it. If it does alter such obligations or duties,
                                then I am not authorized to execute the convention subject to such
                                declaration. This, indeed, so far as my action at present is
                                concerned, is the whole case. But the subject justifies, and perhaps
                                requires some other remarks. You stated that you thought it more
                                frank and loyal to make your declaration in advance, and in this I
                                entirely concurred. If the treaty without such declaration would
                                impose any duty upon France which she would be unwilling to perform,
                                it was manifestly proper that she should declare her purpose in
                                advance. It was proper, not only for the purpose of preventing
                                misunderstanding as to the nature of her intended engagements, but
                                for the other purposes of leaving to the United States the option of
                                determining, with full knowledge, whether she would or would not
                                enter into the treaty subject to such declaration. The declaration,
                                it is true, is not strictly a part of the treaty, yet, for the
                                purpose intended, its effect and operation would be the same as if
                                it were incorporated into the treaty itself. It will prevent
                                misunderstandings as to the nature of the engagements, or, in other
                                words, it will prevent one party complaining of a non-performance of
                                supposed engagements by the other under the treaty, just as
                                effectively as if it were a condition added to the treaty itself.
                                But for the interposition of this declaration I should have <pb
                                    n="246" xml:id="pg_246" facs="0246"/> assented to the execution
                                of the treaty at once; as it is, I have no power to do so.</p>
                            <p>From this it must not be inferred that there is now, or at any time
                                has been, the slightest wish upon the part of the United States to
                                involve France or any other foreign government in its domestic
                                controversy. The wish, nay, stronger than this, the <hi
                                    rend="italic">right</hi> to be let alone by other nations, has
                                been claimed at all times, so far as I know, by our government and
                                its representatives abroad. They have never failed to deprecate, in
                                the most earnest manner, all interference in this question upon the
                                part of foreign powers. Yet the declaration which it is now proposed
                                to make would seem to imply that such interference might be claimed
                                by us at the hands of those powers with whom such treaty might be
                                made. I submit, with great respect, that there is nothing in the
                                present position of the United States, or in the past history of
                                this negotiation, which would justify such an inference. When the
                                present administration at Washington came into power it almost
                                immediately gave orders to its representatives abroad to open
                                negotiations upon this general subject; not, it is to be assumed,
                                for any small purpose or object growing out of what they then
                                believed to be a mere temporary insurrection, but with a view to the
                                settlement, so far as their assent could settle the same, of certain
                                great principles of maritime law.</p>
                            <p>The second and third of those principles, enunciated in the
                                declaration of Paris, has been already proposed and urged upon the
                                attention of other nations by the United States.</p>
                            <p>The fourth of those principles, which requires that blockades to be
                                respected shall be effective, had never been denied (at least by the
                                United States) as a principle of international or maritime law. It
                                was the first only of the points enunciated in that celebrated
                                declaration about which hesitation existed.</p>
                            <p>The abandonment of the right, by belligerents, to issue letters of
                                marque and reprisal, under proper restraints, was a serious matter
                                to a country having-the extended commerce and limited navy of the
                                United States; yet such abandonment by all nations would, we well
                                knew, tend much to lessen the afflictions incident to war; and so,
                                too, the exemption of property of non-combatants at sea, (except
                                contraband,) as it is on land, would, in a still greater degree,
                                tend to the same end.</p>
                            <p>Hence the disposition manifested on the part of the United States, on
                                every proper occasion, to connect in its negotiations the two; to
                                make the concession of the one the equivalent, if possible, of the
                                concession of the other. This was the condition of things when the
                                present administration at Washington came into power. Not trammelled
                                by certain considerations which had affected some of their
                                predecessors, they immediately took up the negotiation where it had
                                been left by a prior administration. Ascertaining definitely that
                                the exemption of private property afloat (except contraband) would
                                not be conceded by <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the powers, they
                                assented at once to the execution of a convention, adopting the four
                                principles of the declaration of Paris as they are, without addition
                                and without limitation.</p>
                            <p>Then, for the first time, we were informed that the government of his
                                Majesty the Emperor (in connexion with that of her Britannic
                                Majesty) would only execute such convention subject to a certain
                                condition, which it declares for itself, and of the extent and
                                operation of which it is itself to judge.</p>
                            <p>I cannot, of course, anticipate with certainty what view the
                                government of the United States may take of this question, but I can
                                scarcely suppose it will assent to the execution of a convention
                                adopting the declaration of Paris, except upon terms of entire
                                reciprocity, and subject to no other condition than those existing
                                by and between the original parties; nor do I believe <pb n="247"
                                    xml:id="pg_247" facs="0247"/> that it will, in its negotiations
                                with foreign governments, at all assent to exceptions and
                                reservations, verbal or written, predicated upon the existing state
                                of things in that country. It will, I apprehend, exact no more and
                                be content with no less than it would have been entitled to had the
                                convention been executed in advance of its present internal
                                controversy. If, therefore, the government of France shall consider
                                that an unconditional execution of that convention will demand of it
                                interference in our affairs, or will implicate it in any shape in
                                the civil war now raging in our country, then it is obvious this is
                                not a proper time for her or for us to enter into such
                                agreements.</p>
                            <p>But these suggestions are made, of course, subject to correction from
                                the government at Washington. To it I shall at once refer the
                                communication of your excellency, together with a copy of the
                                declaration which you have done me the honor to submit upon the part
                                of the French government.</p>
                            <p>I avail myself of the opportunity to renew to your excellency
                                assurances of the high consideration with which I have the honor to

                            received through Captain Schulz.</p>
                        <p>Your action, indicated in 41 and 42, has been anticipated by me In a
                            letter from Mr. Adams, dated London, August 1, 1861, he encloses me a
                            copy of Lord John Russell’s note of July 31, 1861, and in reference to
                            the vague paragraph to which your despatches refer he says: “I do not
                            quite comprehend the drift of the last paragraph, but I presume you will
                            find it out in the progress of your negotiation.” This I immediately
                            answered by a letter, of which I herewith send you a copy.</p>
                        <p>Their subsequent offer to make a written outside declaration
                            cotemporaneous with the execution of the treaty was a degree of
                            frankness which I did <pb n="248" xml:id="pg_248" facs="0248"/> not
                            anticipate, and for which I had not given them credit. I shall wait with
                            great pleasure, according to your instructions, “the result of the
                            explanations which Mr. Adams is instructed to ask,” but I expect that
                            both he and I have already received all necessary explanations on that
                            point. My conversations, at least with Mr. Thouvenel, have covered the
                            whole ground, as stated to you in despatch No. 35. I add that I
                            communicated immediately to Mr. Adams the substance of that conversation
                            with Mr. Thouvenel.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I acknowledge with pleasure the
                                receipt of yours of the 1st instant, enclosing a copy of your note
                                to Lord John Russel and his reply. I feel that we have done a good
                                thing in getting the reply of the British government (declaring the
                                amendment to the treaty of Paris inadmissible) in writing. At least,
                                we can proceed now, under our instructions, with a consciousness
                                that we not only have not neglected this point, but that we have the
                                evidence of having pressed it affirmatively. You say you do not
                                comprehend the drift of the last paragraph in Lord John’s reply. I
                                think I do, at least, in part, and I shall not be surprised if the
                                meaning, which he has purposely wrapped up in that general language,
                                should in the end break off all negotiation. He may not refer to
                                this language again, but unless you ask its meaning before the
                                treaty is negotiated, it will be used by them afterwards as an
                                excuse for not carrying it in effect as respects the
                                insurrectionists of the south. The paragraph states, “the engagement
                                of Great Britain will be prospective, and will not invalidate
                                anything already done.” The comment after the treaty, predicated
                                upon this language, will be: “We had declared before the treaty that
                                the southern insurrectionists were a belligerent party, and entitled
                                to belligerent rights, (among which is the right to issue letters of
                                marque,) and the treaty was to be prospective only, and not to
                                invalidate anything already done. That, in other words, it does not
                                bind your disloyal citizens, recognized by us as a belligerent
                                party.” I long ago wrote Mr. Seward that these powers would, in my
                                judgment, either refuse to negotiate, or, if they did negotiate, it
                                would be with the understanding that it secured us no rights not
                                already conceded, and charged them with no duties not heretofore
                                acknowledged, It is advisable that we raise no question in advance
                                in reference to this matter, but it is necessary that we know what
                                they mean as we go along.</p>
                            <p>With much respect, I am yours truly,</p>

                            been received. I learn from it that Mr. Thouvenel is unwilling to
                            negotiate for an accession by the United States to the declaration of
                            the congress of Paris concerning the rights of neutrals in maritime war,
                            except “on a distinct understanding that it is to have no bearing,
                            directly or indirectly, on the question of the domestic difficulty now
                            existing in our country,” and that to render the matter certain Mr.
                            Thouvenel proposes to make a written declaration simultaneously with his
                            execution of the projected convention for that accession.</p>
                        <p>You have sent me a copy of a note to this effect, addressed to you by Mr.
                            Thouvenel, and have also represented to me an official conversation
                            which he has held with you upon the same subject. The declaration which
                            Mr. Thouvenel thus proposes to make is in these words:</p>
                        <p rend="center">“<hi rend="smallcaps">draft of declaration</hi>.</p>

                                government of his Majesty does not intend to undertake by the said
                                convention any engagements of a nature to implicate it, directly or

                        <p>My despatch of the 17th day of August last, No. 41, which you must have
                            received some time ago, will already have prepared you to expect my
                            approval of the decision to wait for specific instructions in this new
                            emergency at which you have arrived.</p>
                        <p>The obscurity of the text of the declaration which Mr. Thouvenel submits
                            to us is sufficiently relieved by his verbal explanations. According to
                            your report of the conversation, before referred to, he said that both
                            France and Great Britain had already announced that they would take no
                            part in our domestic controversy, and they thought that a frank and open
                            declaration in advance of the execution of the projected convention
                            might save difficulty and misconception hereafter. He further said, in
                            the way of specification, that the provisions of the convention standing
                            alone might bind England and France to pursue and punish the privateers
                            of the south as pirates; that they are unwilling to do this and had so
                            declared. He said, also, that we could deal with these people as we
                            choose, and they (England and France) could only express their regrets
                            on the score of humanity if we should deal with them as pirates, but
                            that they could not participate in such a course. He added, that
                            although both England and France are anxious to have the adhesion of the
                            United States to the declaration of Paris, yet that they would rather
                            dispense with it altogether than be drawn into our domestic controversy.
                            He insisted somewhat pointedly that we could take no just exception to
                            this outside declaration, to be made simultaneously with the execution
                            of the convention, unless we intended that they (England and France)
                            shall be made parties to our controversy, and that the very fact of your
                            hesitation was an additional reason why they should insist upon making
                            such contemporaneous declaration as they proposed.</p>
                        <p>These remarks of Mr. Thouvenel are certainly distinguished by entire
                            frankness. It shall be my effort to reply to them with moderation and
                            candor.</p>

                        <p>In 1856, France, Great Britain, Russia, Prussia, Sardinia and Turkey
                            being assembled in congress at Paris, with a view to modify the law of
                            nations so as to meliorate the evils of maritime war, adopted and set
                            forth a declaration, which is in the following words: <list>
                                <item>1st. Privateering is and remains abolished.</item>
                                <item>2d. The neutral flag covers enemy’s goods, with the exception
                                    of contraband of war.</item>
                                <item>3d. Neutral goods, with the exception of contraband of war,
                                    are not liable to capture under enemy’s flag.</item>
                                <item>4th. Blockades, in order to be binding, must be effective—that
                                    is to say, maintained by forces sufficient really to prevent
                                    access to the coast of the enemy.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>The States which constituted the congress mutually agreed to submit the
                            declaration to all other nations and invite them to accede to it. It was
                            to be submitted as no special or narrow treaty between particular States
                            for limited periods or special purposes of advantage, or under peculiar
                            circumstances; but, on the contrary, its several articles were, by
                            voluntary acceptance of maritime powers, to constitute a new chapter in
                            the law of nations, and each one of the articles was to be universal and
                            eternal in its application and obligation. France especially invited the
                            United States to accede to these articles. An invitation was equally
                            tendered to all other civilized nations, and the articles have been
                            already adopted by forty-one of the powers thus invited. The United
                            States hesitated, but only for the purpose of making an effort to induce
                            the other parties to enlarge the beneficent scope of the declaration
                            Having failed in that effort, they now, after a delay not unusual in
                            such great international discussions, offer their adhesion to that
                            declaration, pure and simple, in the form, words and manner in which it
                            was originally adopted and accepted by all of the forty-six nations
                            which have become parties to it. France declines to receive that
                            adhesion unless she be allowed to make a special declaration, which
                            would constitute an additional and qualifying article, limiting the
                            obligations of France to the United States to a narrower range than the
                            obligations which the United States must assume towards France and
                            towards every other one of the forty-six sovereigns who are parties to
                            it, and narrower than the mutual obligations of all those parties,
                            including France herself.</p>
                        <p>If we should accede to that condition, it manifestly would not be the
                            declaration of the congress of Paris to which we would be adhering, but
                            a different and special and peculiar treaty between France and the
                            United States only. Even as such a treaty it would be unequal. Assuming
                            that Mr. Thouvenel’s reasoning is correct, we should in that case be
                            contracting an obligation, directly or indirectly, to implicate
                            ourselves in any internal conflict that may now be existing or that may
                            hereafter occur in France, while she would be distinctly excused by us
                            from any similar duty towards the United States.</p>
                        <p>I know that France is a friend, and means to be just and equal towards
                            the United States. I must assume, therefore, that she means not to make
                            an exceptional arrangement with us, but to carry out the same
                            arrangement in her interpretation of the obligations of the declaration
                            of the congress of Paris in regard to other powers. Thus carried out,
                            the declaration of Paris would be expounded so as to exclude all
                            internal conflicts in States from the application of the articles of
                            that celebrated declaration. Most of the wars of modern times—perhaps of
                            all times—have been insurrectionary wars, or “internal conflicts.” If
                            the position now assumed by France should thus be taken by all the other
                            parties to the declaration, then it would follow that the first article
                            of that instrument, instead of being, in fact, an universal and
                            effectual inhibition of the practice of privateering, would abrogate it
                            only in wars <pb n="251" xml:id="pg_251" facs="0251"/> between foreign
                            nations, while it would enjoy universal toleration in civil and social
                            wars. With great deference, I cannot but think that, thus modified, the
                            declaration of the congress of Paris would lose much of the reverence
                            which it has hitherto received from Christian nations. If it were proper
                            for me to pursue the argument further, I might add that sedition,
                            insurrection and treason would find in such a new reading of the
                            declaration of Paris encouragement which would tend to render the most
                            stable and even the most beneficent systems of government insecure. Nor
                            do I know on what grounds it can be contended that practices more
                            destructive to property and life ought to be tolerated in civil or
                            fratricidal wars than are allowed in wars between independent
                            nations.</p>
                        <p>I cannot, indeed, admit that the engagement which France is required to
                            make without the qualifying declaration in question would, directly or
                            indirectly, implicate her in our internal conflicts. But if such should
                            be its effect, I must, in the first place, disclaim any desire for such
                            an intervention on the part of the United States. The whole of this long
                            correspondence has had for one of its objects the purpose of averting
                            any such intervention. If, however, such an intervention would be the
                            result of the unqualified execution of the convention by France, then
                            the fault clearly must be inherent in the declaration of the congress of
                            Paris itself, and it is not a result of anything that the United States
                            have done or proposed.</p>
                        <p>Two motives induced them to tender their adhesion to that
                            declaration—first, a sincere desire to co-operate with other progressive
                            nations in the melioration of the rigors of maritime war; second, a
                            desire to relieve France from any apprehension of danger to the lives or
                            property of her people from violence to occur in the course of the civil
                            conflict in which we are engaged, by giving her, unasked, all the
                            guarantees in that respect which are contained in the declaration of the
                            congress of Paris. The latter of these two motives is now put to rest,
                            insomuch as France declines the guarantees we offer. Doubtlessly, she is
                            satisfied that they are unnecessary. We have always practiced on the
                            principles of the declaration. We did so long before they were adopted
                            by the congress of Paris, so far as the rights of neutrals or friendly
                            States are concerned. While our relations with France remain as they now
                            are we shall continue the same practice none the less faithfully than if
                            bound to do so by a solemn convention.</p>
                        <p>The other and higher motive will remain unsatisfied, and it will lose
                            none of its force. We shall be ready to accede to the declaration of
                            Paris with every power that will agree to adopt its principles for the
                            government of its relations to us, and which shall be content to accept
                            our adhesion on the same basis upon which all the other parties to it
                            have acceded.</p>
                        <p>We know that France has a high and generous ambition. We shall wait for
                            her to accept hereafter that co-operation on our part in a great reform
                            which she now declines. We shall not doubt that when the present
                            embarrassment which causes her to decline this co-operation shall have
                            been removed, as it soon will be, she will then agree with us to go
                            still further, and abolish the confiscation of property of
                            non-belligerent citizens and subjects in maritime war.</p>
                        <p>You will inform Mr. Thouvenel that the proposed declaration on the part
                            of the Emperor is deemed inadmissible by the President of the United
                            States; and if it shall be still insisted upon, you will then inform him
                            that you are instructed for the present to desist from further
                            negotiation on the subject involved.</p>

                                prevented you from signing the contemplated convention, and which
                                you were pleased to bring to my knowledge. I desire, however, to set
                                forth clearly, by some further explanations, what is the train of
                                thought followed by the government of the Emperor, in judging, like
                                the government of her Britannic Majesty, that it is expedient to
                                accompany the proposed treaty with a special declaration.</p>
                            <p>If the United States, before the actual crisis, had adhered to the
                                declaration of the congress of Paris, as this adhesion would have
                                bound the whole confederation from that moment, the cabinet of
                                Washington might, at the present time, have availed itself of it to
                                contest the right of the southern States to arm privateers. Now, if
                                this supposition be correct, (fondée,) one could not be astonished
                                that the government of Mr. President Lincoln, according to the
                                principles which it has set forth in its manner of viewing the
                                present conflict, should wish to consider the contemplated
                                convention as much obligatory upon seceded States, in the present
                                circumstances, as if it had preceded the hostilities. But if this
                                opinion be quite explicable on the part of the cabinet of Washington
                                in the situation in which events have placed it, it could not be
                                thus with governments which have proposed to themselves to preserve
                                the strictest neutrality in a struggle, the gravity of which it has
                                no longer been possible for them to disregard. In accepting, then, a
                                proposition presented (formulée) by the federal government, when the
                                war had already unhappily broken out between the northern and
                                southern States of the Union, it was natural that the government of
                                the Emperor, <pb n="253" xml:id="pg_253" facs="0253"/> having
                                decided not to turn itself aside from the attitude of reserve which
                                it had imposed upon itself, should consider beforehand what
                                extension the cabinet of Washington might be induced, on account of
                                its position, to give to an arrangement, by which it declared that
                                the United States renounced privateering. The hostilities, in which
                                the federal government is actually engaged, offering to it the
                                opportunity of putting immediately into practice the abandonment of
                                this mode of warfare; and its intention, officially announced, being
                                to treat the privateers of the south as pirates, it was manifestly
                                of importance to caution the cabinet of Washington against the
                                conviction, where it might exist, that the contemplated treaty
                                obliged us thus to consider the privateers of the south as pirates.
                                I will not dwell upon the matter (n’ insisterai pas) in order to
                                show how much we would deviate from the neutrality we have declared
                                ourselves desirous of observing towards the two factions of the
                                Union, if, after having announced that they would constitute for us
                                two ordinary belligerents, we should contest the primitive rights of
                                a belligerent to one of them, because the other should consent
                                voluntarily to the abandonment of it in a treaty concluded with us.
                                There is no need to point out, further, how we would forcibly break
                                through our neutrality as soon as we should be constrained, in
                                virtue of the contemplated convention, to treat as pirates the
                                privateers which the south will persist in arming. The cabinet of
                                Washington might, then, I repeat, be led, by the particular point of
                                view in which it is placed, to draw from the act which we are ready
                                to conclude such consequences as we should now absolutely reject. It
                                has seemed to us that it is equally important to the two governments
                                to anticipate (prevénir à l’avance) all difference of interpretation
                                as regards the application to the actual circumstances of the
                                principles which were to become common to them both. Otherwise, it
                                would have been to be feared, if the same explanations had had to be
                                exchanged later, that there would have been attributed to them a
                                character altogether different from that which they really possess.
                                We would regret, too, sincerely that the least misunderstanding
                                should be produced in our relations with the United States, not to
                                be anxious, from this moment henceforth, to enlighten them upon a
                                reserve, which, being officially stated to the cabinet of Washington
                                before the signing of the convention, maintains strictly one line of
                                neutrality, without taking away from the value of the agreement,
                                which, in this case, we will be happy to establish with the United
                                States.</p>
                            <p>Accept the assurances of the high consideration with which I have the
                                honor to be, sir, your very humble and very obedient servant,</p>

                            the declaration of the congress of Paris, I have thought it best to
                            submit a copy of the same to Mr. Thouvenel, to be read.</p>

                            perhaps due to him that he should see if he has been correctly reported.
                            Upon one side, it was equally important that, in a matter of so much

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I acknowledge the receipt this morning of
                            despatches Nos. 68, 69, 70, 71, and 72. Their contents relate
                            principally to the reception of sundry despatches from me, with brief
                            answers, for which I am much obliged. I asked any information that it
                            might be proper to give as to the future course of events in the United
                            States, (beyond what is found in the newspapers,) not from curiosity,
                            merely, but because I am sometimes questioned here by parties in the
                            government, and fear that I indicate an unwarrantable ignorance, for I
                            am constrained to say that I know nothing beyond what is common to all
                            the world; while the government and diplomats here take it for granted
                            that I ought to know a great deal more.</p>
                        <p>Your despatch (No. 68) informs me of Mr. Adams’s communication of an
                            intended couuter-proposition to be made by England and France to our
                            government in respect to Mexican affairs. Of this I had heard before,
                            and it made me less anxious as to the question here; for the fact that a
                            counter-proposition was to be made and answered would, of necessity, as
                            I thought, occupy time and give the United States a chance for
                            reflection, and perhaps action. The prompt consummation of this matter
                            in London has rather taken me by surprise. I fear that some
                            misunderstanding of each other’s meaning may have occurred upon the part
                            of Mr. Adams and Earl Russell, or one of them. At all events a point has
                            been reached at a much earlier day than an intimation of such intended
                            proposition led me to anticipate.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your despatch of November 7 (No 75) has
                            been received.</p>
                        <p>I have regretted quite as much as you have my inability at this moment to
                            give advices to you and each other of our representatives abroad of the
                            course of events occurring at home, and of the general drift of our
                            correspondence with other nations; but this domestic commotion has
                            ripened into a transaction so vast as to increase more than fourfold the
                            labors of administration in every department. You can readily imagine
                            how vast a machinery has been created in the War Department, in the Navy
                            Department, and in the Treasury Department, respectively. The head of
                            each is a man of busy occupations, high responsibilities, and perplexing
                            cares. You would hardly suppose that a similar change has come over the
                            modest little State Department of other and peaceful days; but the
                            exactions upon it are infinite, and out of all that offers itself to be
                            done, I can only select and do that which cannot be wisely or safely
                            left undone.</p>
                        <p>Thus far we have no official notice from Europe of the proceedings there
                            in regard to Mexico.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: You receive the President’s instructions
                            for the discharge of your very important mission at a moment when a
                            domestic crisis, long apprehended with deep solicitude, is actually
                            reached. For the first time since the foundations of this federal
                            republic were laid with such pious care and consummate wisdom, an
                            insurrection has developed itself, and assumed the organization and
                            attitude of a separate political power. This organization Consists of
                            several members of this Union, under the name of “The Confederate States
                            of America.” That irregular and usurping authority has instituted civil
                            war. The President of the United States has adopted defensive and
                            repressive measures, including the employment of federal forces by land
                            and by sea, with the establishment of a maritime blockade. The
                            revolutionists have opposed to these inevitable measures an army of
                            invasion directed against this capital, and a force of privateers
                            incited to prey upon the national commerce, and ultimately, no doubt,
                            the commerce of the world. It seems the necessity of faction in every
                            country that whenever it acquires sufficient boldness to inaugurate
                            revolution, it then alike forgets the counsels of prudence and stifles
                            the instincts of patriotism, and becomes a suitor to foreign courts for
                            aid and assistance to subvert and destroy the most cherished and
                            indispensable institutions of its own. So it has already happened in
                            this case that the revolutionary power has, as it is understood,
                            despatched agents to Europe to solicit from the States of that continent
                            at least their acknowledgment of its asserted sovereignty and
                            independence. To oppose this application and prevent its success will be
                            your chief duty, and no more important one was ever devolved by the
                            United States upon any representative whom they have sent abroad.</p>
                        <p>There would, indeed, be no danger of the success of the unpatriotic
                            application if the governments addressed could be relied upon to
                            understand their true interests, and fulfil the obligations of national
                            justice and fraternity. But unhappily in the present condition of
                            society nations are, to say the least, neither wiser nor more just or
                            generous than individual men.</p>
                        <p>You will take care that you do not yourself misunderstand the spirit in
                            which your duty is to be performed, nor suffer that spirit to be
                            misapprehended by the government of her Catholic Majesty. The government
                            of the United States, in the first place, indulges no profound
                            apprehensions for its safety, even although the government to which you
                            are accredited, and even many others of the European continent, should
                            intervene in this unhappy civil war. The union of these States, with the
                            maintenance of their republican institutions, is guaranteed by material,
                            moral, and social necessities of this continent and mankind, that will,
                            the President feels assured, overbear all aggression that shall be
                            committed upon them, no matter how various its forms or how
                            comprehensive its combinations. The trial involves only the questions
                            how long shall the struggle be protracted, and <pb n="258"
                                xml:id="pg_258" facs="0258"/> what shall be the measure of the
                            disasters and calamities it shall inflict. Secondly. The government
                            neither expects nor asks, nor would it consent to receive, aid or favor
                            from Spain or any other foreign state. It asks only that such states
                            perform their treaty obligations, and leave this domestic controversy to
                            the care and conduct of those to whom it exclusively belongs. Whenever
                            this republic shall have come to need the protection or favor of any
                            other nation, it will have become unable and unworthy to exist, however
                            aided from abroad.</p>
                        <p>The President, in the absence of all information, is left to conjecture
                            what are the influences upon which the so-called Confederate States rely
                            to induce her Catholic Majesty’s government to grant their disloyal
                            application. The high consideration which he entertains for her Majesty
                            enables him to assume that the appeal taken from this government to her
                            royal favor, proceeds, in part at least, on the ground that the
                            revolutionists affect to have suffered oppression and wrong at the hands
                            of the government of the United States, which entitle them to the
                            sympathy of the Queen of Spain, if not to redress through her
                            intervention. Her Catholic Majesty’s government has not been addicted to
                            such intervention hitherto, and the wisdom of its forbearance is seen in
                            the revival of the energies of that great and honored nation, which now
                            seems renewing a felicitous career.</p>
                        <p>The President, however, will not rely merely on the forbearance of any
                            foreign power, not even on that of the government of Spain.</p>
                        <p>That government well understands the Constitution of the United States,
                            and has had opportunity to learn its practical operation It therefore
                            knows that the several States which constitute the federal Union can
                            respectively practice tyranny or oppression upon individual citizens,
                            and may even hinder and embarrass the general government, while, on the
                            other hand, that government, being armed with only a few though very
                            important powers needful for preserving domestic peace, and defence
                            against foreign nations, can neither oppress nor impoverish nor annoy
                            any member of the Union or any private citizen.</p>
                        <p>In the present case there are some points which will not escape
                            consideration, namely: <list>
                                <item>1st. The very interest which now resorts to insurrection,
                                    practically speaking, has directed the administration of the
                                    federal government from the hour when the first murmur of
                                    discontent was heard until now when it raises the flag of
                                    disunion.</item>
                                <item>2d. The federal government, now seventy years old, has never
                                    made a foreign war which that same interest, now so
                                    insurrectionary, did not urge or demand; has never extended its
                                    dominion a square mile by discovery, conquest, or purchase
                                    except at the instance of the same party; has never exacted an
                                    irregular contribution, or levied an illegal or unequal tax, and
                                    only in war has imposed a direct tax. It has divided civil,
                                    military, and naval honors and trusts between all classes and
                                    sections, if not impartially, at least with preference of the
                                    same interest. It has constructed all the defences required for
                                    the section where that interest prevails, and for forty years
                                    has accommodated that interest with special legislation and
                                    beneficial arrangements with foreign powers. The administration
                                    of the government has been so just and so tolerant that no
                                    citizen of any one of the States claiming to be aggrieved has
                                    ever been deprived by it of his liberty, except on conviction of
                                    crime by his peers of the vicinage, nor of his property without
                                    due compensation, nor forfeited his life under its authority
                                    except as a volunteer in the battles of his country. I will not
                                    pursue the subject. It is enough to show that while this
                                    government will submit its action in domestic affairs to the
                                    judgment of no other nation, it does not fear to encounter the
                                    moral opinion of mankind.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <pb n="259" xml:id="pg_259" facs="0259"/>
                        <p>Will the disunionists claim that they are the discoverers of a new and
                            beneficent system of political government, which commends itself to the
                            patronage of her Catholic Majesty? What are the salient principles of
                            their system? First, government shall employ no standing military force
                            in conducting administration of its domestic concerns, but shall always
                            be constituted by popular suffrage, and be dependent upon it. But it
                            shall, at the same time, be the right of the minority, when overruled in
                            the elections, to resort to insurrection, not merely to reverse the
                            popular decree, but even to overthrow the government itself, while, on
                            the other hand, the government can never lawfully use force to coerce
                            compliance with its laws.</p>
                        <p>2d. The several states, districts, intendencies, or provinces which
                            constitute a nation, must be brought and held together not in any case
                            by conquest or force, but by voluntary federation, which may be
                            stipulated to be perpetual. But each constituent state, district,
                            intendency, or province retains an inherent and absolute sovereignty,
                            and its people may rightfully withdraw from the federal Union at
                            pleasure, equally in war as in peace, leaving its common debts unpaid,
                            its common treaties unfulfilled, its common defence frustrated.
                            Moreover, the seceding party may seize all the federal treasures,
                            defences, institutions, and property found within its own limits, and
                            convert them to its own use, simply offering to come at its own future
                            pleasure to an equitable account. It is not to be doubted that the
                            kingdom of Spain could be dissolved by her Catholic Majesty’s acceptance
                            of this new system much more rapidly than by waiting the slow effect of
                            foreign wars or domestic mal-administration. Castile, and Old Castile,
                            Leon, Andalusia and Aragon, Cuba and the Philippine Islands, would be
                            much more easily separated on this plan than New York and Louisiana,
                            California and Massachusetts, Florida and Michigan.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps the so-called Confederate States will rest their appeal on some
                            especial ground of sympathy with Spain and the states of Spanish
                            America.</p>
                        <p>In such a case you will need only to say that the moderation which has
                            thus far been practiced by the United States towards Spain, and the
                            Spanish American states once her colonies, has been due chiefly to the
                            fact that the several North American states of British derivation,
                            exclusive of Canada, have been bound together in a federal Union, and
                            the continuance of that Union is the only guarantee for the practice of
                            the same moderation hereafter.</p>
                        <p>Will the so-called Confederate States promise liberal or reciprocal
                            commerce with Spain or her provinces? What commerce can there be between
                            states whose staples are substantially identical? Sugar cannot be
                            exchanged for sugar, cotton for cotton, or rice for rice. The United
                            States have always been willing, and undoubtedly they always will remain
                            willing, to establish commerce with Spain and her provinces on terms as
                            mutually reciprocal as the government of that country itself will
                            allow.</p>
                        <p>These thoughts are presented to you by direction of the President, not as
                            exhausting the subject, but only as suggestions to your own vigorous and
                            comprehensive mind, and he confidently relies on your applying all its
                            powers to the full discussion of the subject if it shall become
                            necessary.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: An interview has taken place between
                                the minister of foreign affairs and myself in reference to the
                                subject embraced in your circular.</p>
                            <p>In conformity with your instructions, I presented the inaugural
                                address of the President as expressive of his policy towards the
                                seceding States, and read to him your despatch, saying that the
                                administration conceived that the unhappy differences existing in
                                America owed their origin to popular passions and were of a
                                transient character, and that the President was well assured of the
                                speedy restoration of the harmony and unity of the government.</p>
                            <p>The minister replied with courtesy, expressing pain at the posture of
                                affairs in the United States, but said that her Majesty’s government
                                was informed that extensive military and naval preparations were
                                making in the north to enforce the federal supremacy in the south,
                                and that the consequences were to be dreaded. I replied that I felt
                                assured his information was erroneous.</p>
                            <p>No commissioners from the Confederated States have yet applied for
                                the recognition of the Southern Confederacy, as I informed you in my
                                former despatch. The minister has promised me that no negotiations
                                for that purpose shall be conducted without my being fully informed.
                                This is as satisfactory an arrangement as could be desired under
                                existing circumstances.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your despatch of May 20, No. 1, has
                            reached me, and varies the instructions of May 9.</p>
                        <p>Please find annexed copy of my note to Mr. Calderon, dated yesterday,
                            which I placed in his hands accompanied by a copy of your despatch. I
                            deemed it proper to provoke a repetition to myself of the assurance
                            given to Mr. Preston, and fix it by a statement in writing.</p>
                        <p>On this subject, of the recognition by Spain of the pretended government
                            of the Confederate States, I have had various interviews with
                            influential personages, and with the sub-secretary and the first
                            secretary of state. I have represented the position of the rebel party
                            in a light which was evidently new to them.</p>
                        <p>Yesterday, in a long and very satisfactory interview with Mr. Calderon, I
                            explained to him the connexion of Mr. Jefferson Davis and other leaders
                            in the southern rebellion with the attempt made in 1854–’55 by the same
                            parties to provoke a war with Spain for the conquest of Cuba. He was
                            made to see that the former filibustering against Cuba had its origin,
                            like the present rebellion at the south, in the political ambition of
                            our slave owners. They then wished to re-enforce the slave power in the
                            Union by the annexation of new slave States, but having failed in Cuba,
                            in Nicaragua, in Kansas, and lastly in the recent presidential election,
                            they had at length to turn their arms against the government of the
                            United States, now passed out of their control.</p>
                        <p>Secession was filibustering struck in. I explained that, unhappily, a
                            class at the south called by the slave owners “mean whites” were quite
                            ready to follow their lead, and were a terrible instrument in their
                            hands. Their own ignorance, their dependence upon the richer class, and
                            their contact with the blacks had gradually reduced them, intellectually
                            and morally, to a point of which, perhaps, there were few examples in
                            the Anglo-Saxon race. They were as reckless of danger as they were of
                            right, as ready to embark for the fever lakes of Central America as for
                            the sugar fields of Cuba, or the wilds of Kansas, or a campaign against
                            the government of their country.</p>
                        <p>This was good material for a rebel soldiery; and under the more
                            intelligent lead of the slave owners this revolt was undoubtedly serious
                            and would cost blood. But the result was not doubtful. The disparity of
                            force and resources on the part of the government was too overbalancing
                            to leave the rebels a chance of long prolonging the struggle.</p>
                        <p>Happily, between the ambitious class of slave owners and the so-called
                            “mean whites,” their instruments, there was a middle class in the south,
                            more numerous than the two together, loyal to the Union and the
                            Constitution. These loyal citizens were now held in a state of duress by
                            the violence and intimidation employed by the slave owners and their
                            instruments. His excellency would have noticed that from the beginning
                            to this day the rebels had not obtained the sanction of a popular vote
                            to any of their high acts. Nevertheless this was the only basis of
                            political right known in America. We had no king, no church, no
                            aristocracy, no other political guarantee or sanction in our nation than
                            the will of the people fairly expressed. None of the so-called
                            ordinances separating States from the Union had been ratified by the
                            people of those States themselves; nor had the pretended new
                            confederation of those States, nor the formation of a constitution and
                            government <pb n="262" xml:id="pg_262" facs="0262"/> for the so-called
                            Confederate States, nor any other of the high acts pretended to have
                            been accomplished in the name of the people of certain States, ever
                            received their sanction or concurrence. The majority was against such
                            proceedings in the southern States themselves. The whole was the work of
                            a party which, by violence, was imposing its action upon those
                            States.</p>
                        <p>Leaving out of view the question whether a State might or might not
                            secede from the United States by its own will, really up to this time no
                            such will had been manifested. The pretended acts of sovereignty
                            exercised by those States in fact were not the acts of those States, but
                            simply the acts of a party which shows itself a minority in those
                            States.</p>
                        <p>They were hollow, they lacked the only sanction which could give them
                            substance.</p>
                        <p>And the appearance of a confederate government set up by the faction
                            operating in the south was an appearance only—convenient for their own
                            purposes, but having no condition entitling it to the consideration of
                            foreign States.</p>
                        <p>Without the sanction of the people it was a pretence and no reality. I
                            mentioned the example of the court, or appearance of a court, set up by
                            Don Carlos in the northern provinces of Spain not many years since, and
                            asked Mr. Calderon whether that was a government either <hi
                                rend="italic">de jure</hi> or <hi rend="italic">de facto;</hi> and
                            yet Don Carlos and his rebel army and sympathizers held a large district
                            for a considerable period subject to their duress.</p>
                        <p>Thus the appearance set up in our southern States was no government
                            either <hi rend="italic">de jure</hi> or <hi rend="italic">de
                            facto</hi>. It was at best a transitory form of violence, a phase of
                            anarchy, a thing which could endure only whilst the violence might
                            endure which had produced and still maintained it. But, aside from this
                            violence, there was no political guarantee in Mr. Davis, nor in his
                            followers, nor in the class from which they spring. Up to this time they
                            had been unrestrained, and their demonstrations completely unchecked, by
                            any show of force on the part of the government; but now it had been
                            found necessary to display the power of the Union, and our forces were
                            preparing by land and sea to quell this sedition and release the loyal
                            people of the southern States from the duress of this rebel faction.</p>
                        <p>Much more was said, and questions asked and answered, which it is hardly
                            necessary to repeat.</p>
                        <p>The result of this interview, I am happy to say, may be regarded by the
                            President as decisive in regard to Spain. Much had been done previously,
                            but it was brought to a termination yesterday.</p>
                        <p>The minister of state not only renewed to me the assurance given to Mr.
                            Preston, but amplified it, stating absolutely that if any commissioners
                            of other negotiators should appear in behalf of the so-called
                            Confederate States, the government would not see them nor recognize them
                            in any capacity; that Spain would have nothing to do with the rebel
                            party in the United States in any sense.</p>
                        <p>I might write this to my government, and say besides that her Majesty’s
                            first secretary of state had promised me that within a few days, as soon
                            as it could be declared, a decree would be issued by this government
                            prohibiting all Spaniards from taking service on either side, and
                            ordering all the subjects of Spain to maintain complete neutrality in
                            the contest now begun in the United States; that she would prohibit the
                            entrance of southern privateers into any of her ports, peninsular and
                            colonial, and prohibit the furnishing of any supplies to the rebels,
                            whether arms, provisions, coals, ships, or any other merchandise which
                            might aid in their revolt against the government of the Union. Armed
                            ships, with their prizes, would not be permitted to enter her ports.
                            Spanish subjects would be forbidden to accept any letter of marque or
                            other such document, or serve on board of any privateer; <pb n="263"
                                xml:id="pg_263" facs="0263"/> and no fitting out of vessels for the
                            purpose of taking part in hostilities against the United States could be
                            permitted, but impeded with vigor and severity.</p>
                        <p>I have again seen Mr. Calderon to-day, and he informed me that, in
                            pursuance of these declarations, he had just come from a council of
                            ministers, where he had been occupied with this business, and that the
                            decree would appear in two or three days at most, and that he would also
                            write to Señor Tassara, her Majesty’s representative in Washington, to
                            make you the same announcement on the part of his government.</p>

                        <p>He also drew my attention to the fact that, though the decree proclaims
                            neutrality, it expressly prohibits any supplies to be furnished to

                            and equipped with all they need; and this provision tells exclusively
                            against the party issuing letters of marque.</p>

                            <p>Taking into consideration the relations which exist between Spain and
                                the United States of America, and the desirability that the
                                reciprocal sentiments of good intelligence should not be changed by
                                reason of the grave events which have taken place in that republic,
                                I have resolved to maintain the most strict neutrality in the
                                contest begun between the federal States of the Union and the States
                                confederated at the south; and in order to avoid the damage which
                                might come to my subjects and to navigation, and to commerce, from
                                the want of clear provisions to which to adjust their conduct in
                                consonance with my council of ministers, I do decree the
                                following:</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Article</hi> 1. It is forbidden in all the ports
                                of the monarchy to arm, provide, or equip any privateer vessel,
                                whatever may be the flag she displays.</p>

                                the owners, masters, or captains of merchant vessels to accept
                                letters of marque, or contribute in any way whatsoever to the
                                armanent or equipment of vessels-of-war or privateers.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Art.</hi> 3. It is forbidden to vessels-of-war
                                or privateers with their prizes to enter or to remain for more than
                                twenty-four hours in the ports of the monarchy, except in case of
                                stress of weather. Whenever this last shall occur, the authorities
                                will keep watch over the vessel and oblige her to get out to sea the
                                soonest possible without permitting her to take in any stores except
                                the purely necessary for the moment, but in no case arms nor
                                supplies for war.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Art.</hi> 4. Articles proceeding from prizes
                                shall not be sold in the ports of the monarchy.</p>

                                directed to blockaded ports. The transportation of effects of war is
                                forbidden, as well as the carrying of papers or communications for
                                belligerents. Transgressors shall be responsible for their acts, and
                                shall have no right to the protection of my government.</p>

                                considered as contrary to neutrality.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Art.</hi> 8. Those who violate the foregoing
                                provisions shall have no right to the protection of my government,
                                shall suffer the consequences of the measures which the belligerents
                                may dictate, and shall be punished according to the laws of

                        <p>I confess this subject has been a favorite with me ever since I
                            succeeded, in 1854, in inducing the Spanish government to consent to
                            negotiate with me for the conclusion of a commercial treaty upon the
                            liberal and advantageous basis of the eleven articles then drawn up and
                            sent to the State Department, accompanied with this offer on the ——
                            September of that year.</p>
                        <p>On entering again upon the discharge of the duties of this legation, I
                            took an early opportunity, therefore, to sound the dispositions of the
                            present minister of state on this subject, as well as the feeling of
                            other officers and personages influential in this government.</p>
                        <p>In no quarter has the idea of arranging the commercial intercourse of the
                            two countries upon a more liberal basis been repelled. The minister of
                            state told me, without hesitation, that he would enter with me upon the
                            work of negotiating a treaty for this purpose readily, and with the idea
                            that we should find no great difficulty in bringing it to a successful
                            conclusion.</p>
                        <p>I mentioned, especially, the subject of the Cuban flour duties, and
                            received the reply, now as in years before, that these would be yielded
                            by Spain, and the Spanish colonial market thrown open to the
                            introduction of our grains and provisions of all kinds.</p>
                        <p>Some compensation, or show of compensation, to the Castilian
                            wheat-growers may be asked in the form of a reduction of our duties on
                            the cheap wines of Castile; and whilst I see no great objection to such
                            an arrangement, I am, at the same time, persuaded that practically it
                            would amount to little in its effects either upon our revenue or upon
                            the agricultural interests of Castile.</p>
                        <p>The motive of these conversations was to assure myself, for your
                            information, what were the present wishes and dispositions of the
                            Spanish government on this subject, prior to that coolness in our
                            relations which must follow the presentation of the protest of June 19.
                            I repeat, I have found these dispositions, now as heretofore, entirely
                            favorable to the object mentioned, and I could have undertaken to carry
                            a negotiation on this subject to a conclusion satisfactory to you, and
                            highly advantageous to our people interested in the trade with the
                            Spanish colonies.</p>
                        <p>As to the convention for the settlement of claims, which was signed by
                            Mr. Preston, the minister of state expressed his regret that it had not
                            received the ratification of the Senate, but had no doubt we should be
                            able to arrange it so as to avoid the objections of that body. Other
                            more pressing affairs induced me not to go much into the matter in the
                            absence of your instructions.</p>
                        <p>But may I inquire what objection there would be on the part of the
                            present administration, or of the Senate, to such a convention for this
                            purpose, as I had the honor of offering to the acceptance of the
                            administration of President Pierce, in September, 1854, a convention on
                            the model of that concluded with Great Britain in February, 1853, free
                            from especial clauses in reference to any particular claim, and
                            embracing <hi rend="italic">all</hi> claims by citizens or subjects of
                            either country on the government of the other, without designation nor
                            exception of any?</p>
                        <p>Should any change of circumstances lead you to recur to this subject, it
                            will perhaps be useful to know that such an arrangement can be made.</p>
                        <p>With the highest respect, sir, your obedient servant,</p>

                        <p>Señor Calderon Collantes then asked me whether the declaration of
                            neutrality on the part of Spain in regard to our domestic troubles was
                            satisfactory to my government. I replied that the government of the
                            United States asked for and expected from foreign powers nothing but to
                            be left to dispose of our domestic controversy as it deemed best. As to
                            the declaration of neutrality on the part of Spain, I had received no
                            expression of opinion from my government, and that I thought it would be
                            considered satisfactory.</p>
                        <p>I then asked Señor Calderon Collantes whether any application had been
                            made to her Majesty’s government for the recognition of the so-called
                            Confederate States. He replied that no such application had been made,
                            and that to his knowledge none of the gentlemen said to have come to
                            Europe for that purpose had touched the soil of Spain. He assured me, in
                            addition, that if anything of the kind should occur he would immediately
                            communicate the fact to this legation.</p>
                        <p>In relation to my presentation to the Queen, Señor Calderon Collantes
                            said that it was uncertain whether her Majesty would be able to receive
                            me previous to her departure for Santander, which was to take place on
                            the 15th instant; but that he would bring the matter before a meeting of
                            the cabinet, to be held the same evening, and advise me in due time of
                            their decision. He requested me, at the same time, to communicate to him
                            the draft of the speech which I intended to deliver at the
                            reception.</p>
                        <p>In the course of the night Mr. Perry was advised that her Majesty would
                            be pleased to receive me the next day, at 9.30 o’clock p. m.</p>

                        <p>At the appointed hour I was received by her Majesty. I have the pleasure
                            to annex a copy of the speech I delivered in presenting my letter of
                            credence, as well as her Majesty’s answer.</p>
                        <p>Last night there was a general reception by the Queen and the King
                            consort of the diplomatic corps, which I attended, accompanied by Mr.
                            Perry. I may mention that on both occasions I was, contrary to the rules
                            of court etiquette, admitted in a plain citizen’s dress, the shortness
                            of the time not having permitted me to prepare a proper court
                            costume.</p>
                        <p>I cannot close this despatch without expressing my sincere gratification
                            at the manner in which Mr. Perry had prepared for my reception here, and
                            the many obliging attentions he has shown me since. Although my
                            acquaintance with him is of but three days standing, yet I have no doubt
                            our official and social intercourse will be of the most cordial

                            Steamer called Sumter, on the 6th July instant, entered that port with
                            seven vessels belonging to citizens of the United States, which she had
                            captured, with their officers, and also the officers and seamen of
                            another such vessel which she had captured and burned on the high seas.
                            The department is further informed that the Sumter was, on that
                            occasion, manned by a full <pb n="268" xml:id="pg_268" facs="0268"/>
                            complement of seamen, marines, officers, and firemen; that she carried
                            an armament of five or eight heavy guns, and that thus manned and armed
                            the vessel was supplied with coal and water at Cienfuegos, and was
                            allowed to depart on the same day to a destination unknown.</p>
                        <p>The undersigned is further informed that the captured vessels were
                            detained in the port of Cienfuegos, and that their crews, together with
                            that of the vessel which had been burned, were set at liberty.</p>
                        <p>It is the duty of the undersigned to bring this extraordinary transaction
                            to the notice of the Spanish government. This government will cheerfully
                            receive any explanations of it which the Spanish government may feel
                            itself at liberty to give. But in the meantime, assuming the facts to be
                            correctly presented as they are above stated, the undersigned is
                            instructed by the President of the United States to inform the Spanish
                            government that he deems the admittance of the said piratical vessel,
                            the Sumter, into the port of Cienfuegos, with the captured vessels and
                            crews before described, her supply there with coal and water, and her
                            permitted departure, to have been in violation of the treaties existing
                            between this government and Spain, as well as of the law of nations; and
                            this government, in this view, will expect the immediate release and
                            discharge of the captured vessels and their cargoes. Reserving the
                            subject of indemnity for the injury inflicted upon the United States by
                            the transaction, as recited, until time for explanation shall have been
                            afforded, the undersigned is nevertheless instructed to ask at once that
                            her Catholic Majesty’s government will take effective measures to
                            prevent the recurrence of transactions in the ports of Spain of the kind
                            now in question, which are not more injurious to the commerce of the
                            United States than toward that of Spain herself and of all other
                            commercial nations.</p>
                        <p>The undersigned is induced to believe that those requests will not only
                            meet prompt attention, but will even be answered in a manner
                            satisfactory to the United States. This belief is founded on these
                            facts: first, a correspondence which has taken place between the consul
                            general of the United States and his excellency the governor general of
                            the Island of Cuba relating to the subject has been submitted to this
                            department, in which correspondence the governor general announces that
                            he has been left withont the aid of instructions in the matter, and that
                            he shall abide the directions of his government, in the meantime taking
                            your advice in the premises. Further, this government has been advised
                            by a communication from Mr. Perry, lately acting as chargé d’affaires at
                            Madrid, under date of the 13th of June last, that he was directed by the
                            Spanish government to inform the government of the United States that
                            Spain would prohibit the entrance of southern privateers into any of her
                            ports, peninsular or colonial, and would also prohibit the furnishing of
                            any supplies to the rebels, whether arms, provisions, coals, ships, or
                            any other merchandise, and that armed vessels, with their prizes, would
                            not be permitted to enter the ports of Spain. Moreover, the same mail
                            which brought the information of this transaction, brought also a
                            despatch from Mr. Perry, containing later assurances received from the
                            government of Spain similar to those already recited, together with an
                            official copy of a royal decree of the 15th June, giving legal effect to
                            the promises thus so repeatedly made.</p>
                        <p>In specifying these particular grounds of confidence for an expectation
                            of a satisfactory disposition of the subject of this communication, the
                            undersigned is by no means to be regarded as excluding the more general
                            assurances of amity and friendship which have been lately exchanged
                            between the two governments, or their habits of good faith and
                            reciprocal justice which have been confirmed by an almost unbroken
                            experience of two-thirds of a century.</p>
                        <p>In order to elucidate the subject of this note, the undersigned causes to
                                <pb n="269" xml:id="pg_269" facs="0269"/> be annexed thereto a copy
                            of some of the official communications to which allusion has been made,
                            and especially the correspondence between his excellency the governor
                            general of Cuba and the consul general of the United States in that
                            island, and the recent communication from Mr. Perry, together with a
                            copy of the royal decree to which reference has been made.</p>
                        <p>The undersigned avails himself of this occasion to offer to Mr. Tassara
                            renewed assurances of his high consideration.</p>

                            which has taken place between this government and Mr. Tassara respecting
                            the detention of several American vessels at Cienfuegos, which were
                            carried into that port by the privateer Sumter, with copies of documents
                            which illustrate the subject.</p>
                        <p>I regret very much that the captain general did not assume responsibility
                            to deliver up the vessels, and that Mr. Tassara also declined it. It
                            must be apparent that the entire commerce of Spain, as well as that of
                            this country, is exposed to serious embarrassment if her Catholic
                            Majesty’s government, under whatever view of the subject, suffers
                            privateers to find shelter, or supplies, or favor.</p>
                        <p>This government does not doubt that the Spanish government will promptly
                            direct the release of the vessels, with their cargoes.</p>

                            royal order of the 16th of May last, addressed to the captain general of
                            Cuba, and published in the Gazette of the Havana on the 16th June, just
                            published in the official Gazette of Madrid.</p>
                        <p>It provides that, during the fourteen months after its publication at the
                            Havana, all hard biscuit should be admitted free of duty in Cuba, no

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your despatches Nos. 10, 11, 12, and 13. The exequatur for
                            Mr. Little has immediately been applied for.</p>
                        <p>In pursuance of the instruction contained in your despatch No. 11, I
                            addressed a note to Señor Calderon Collantes, a copy of which is hereto
                            annexed, (No. 1.) I would have solicited an interview with the secretary
                            for the purpose of expressing to him the satisfaction with which the
                            proclamation of the Queen was received by the President, had he not been
                            absent from the capital. In my despatch No. 2 I informed you that on
                            Monday, July 15, the second day after my reception, the Queen left
                            Madrid for Santander, and that the secretary for foreign affairs
                            accompanied her. Sandander not being one of the regular summer
                            residences of the Queen, the diplomatic corps remained here, with the
                            exception of a very few members who were specially invited to join the
                            court, probably for the purpose of discussing Neapolitan affairs. It is
                            for this reason that I have not seen Señor Calderon Collantes since the
                            day of my reception by the Queen. Having no business on hand which
                            called for immediate action, I deemed it prudent to follow the example
                            of the rest of the diplomatic corps.</p>
                        <p>The court will leave Santander on the 13th instant, and then either spend
                            a few days at Madrid, or go directly to La Granja, where the Queen will
                            be joined by the whole diplomatic corps.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Yesterday I received a despatch from
                                the Secretary of State of the United States, informing me that the
                                President has read with the greatest satisfaction the proclamation
                                of her Catholic Majesty concerning the unfortunate troubles that
                                have arisen in the United States, and it affords me the sincerest
                                pleasure to express to your excellency the high sense which the <pb
                                    n="271" xml:id="pg_271" facs="0271"/> President entertains of
                                her Majesty’s prompt decision and friendly action upon this
                                occasion.</p>
                            <p>In connexion with the fulfilment of this most agreeable duty, I beg
                                leave to call your excellency’s attention to the following
                                telegraphic report, contained in the London “Times” of July 27: <list>
                                    <item>“Advices have been received from Havana to the 10th
                                        instant. The privateer steamer Sumter had captured eight
                                        American ships laden with sugar on the south side of Cuba.
                                        One was burnt, and the other seven were taken by prize crews
                                        into Cienfuegos. One report states that the captain general
                                        of Cuba had released them. Another report asserts that he
                                        had detained them in order to refer the matter to
                                        Madrid.”</item>
                                </list></p>
                            <p>In the latter case I trust her Majesty’s government will not hesitate
                                to cause the policy laid down in the royal proclamation to be
                                loyally and promptly carried into effect.</p>
                            <p>I have the honor to remain, with sentiments of distinguished
                                consideration, your excellency’s obedient servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Mr. Perry’s despatch, No. 13, dated July
                            12, was delayed, and only came to hand simultaneously with your own
                            despatch (No. 8) of July 18, which relates in part to the same subject,
                            namely, the negotiation of a treaty between the United States and Spain
                            for the liquidation of claims, and for the melioration of the commercial
                            arrangements between the two governments affecting trade with the
                            Spanish West India colonies. My answer to your own (No. 3) includes all
                            that it seems necessary to say concerning Mr. Perry’s communication
                            first mentioned, except one point. That point I shall now consider. Not
                            only would this government cheerfully enter into a treaty raising a
                            joint commission for the settling of pending claims between the two
                            countries, or between their citizens and subjects, but it deems it
                            essentially important and desirable that all such claims should be put
                            into that very proper channel for settlement. But this government does
                            not regard the so-called Amistad claim as having any valid obligation in
                            law or conscience, and can in no case consent to negotiate upon it.
                            While, therefore, we shall not be critical as to the form of words to be
                            used in describing the claims to be submitted to the proposed joint
                            commission, frankness requires that the exception of that supposed claim
                            shall be expressed, or at least distinctly understood.</p>
                        <p>I am well aware that this instruction differs radically from admissions
                            and acknowledgments heretofore made by several of the predecessors of
                            the President. Each of them has considered the subject for himself, and
                            pronounced upon it according to his own convictions. The new President,
                            under the same obligation, instructs me to make known to you his
                            disallowance of the claim in question. It were, indeed, to be desired
                            that there should be consistency in the action of the government
                            throughout successive administrations, especially where foreign nations
                            are concerned, but justice and reason cannot be safely compromised by
                            any government, even for the sake of preserving perfect consistency with
                            itself through a series of years, and in its intercourse with foreign
                            states.</p>

                            August 6, has been received. Your note written to Mr. Calderon Collantes
                            on the subject of the reception of the piratical vessel Sumter with her
                            prizes at Cienfuegos was eminently proper and is approved. You are
                            already aware that the governor general of the Island of Cuba has
                            released the prizes. I defer further remark concerning that transaction,
                            if indeed any shall now be necessary, until the answer of the minister
                            of foreign affairs to your note shall have been received.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your despatch No. 7, dated August 6, has
                            been received. I can very well understand that you were deeply
                            distressed by the first reports of the battle at Bull Run. Those reports
                            grossly exaggerated a disaster which was sufficiently afflicting in its
                            real proportions. The exultation of persons and classes in foreign
                            nations prejudiced against our country and its institutions is one of
                            the penalties we pay for the civil discord into which we have fallen.
                            But even a very limited experience of human nature will enable us to
                            practice the necessary equanimity in such a crisis. Changes of habit and
                            policy are necessary to national growth and progress. We have had little
                            reason to expect that such changes in our case should always be effected
                            without the occurrence of some disorder and violence. Let us be content
                            that the country has virtue enough to pass the ordeal safely, and that
                            when it is passed, our prosperity will be greater and more assured than
                            ever.</p>

                            he shall be disposed to receive it you will deliver a copy of it to

                        <p>I think that the Spanish government can entertain no doubt that the
                            United States earnestly and even anxiously desire to avert, if possible,
                            any such alienation as might lead to a conflict between the two
                            countries as an episode in the civil war which is unhappily prevailing
                            at the present moment in the southern part of the republic. I am
                            perfectly satisfied that the Spanish government is animated by the same
                            desire. Upon this point I speak sincerely and upon full consideration. I
                            am not equally confident, however, that the consuls of the United States
                            in the Island of Cuba will always, in the absence of special
                            instructions for unforeseen contingencies, exercise the discretion which
                            the interests of our country require.</p>
                        <p>The government of the United States is not to be misunderstood as fearing
                            to encounter the intervention of Spain in favor of the insurgents of
                            this country, if her Catholic Majesty’s sentiments and purposes have
                            been misconstrued. We are aware, we think, of all the perils of our
                            situation, and have not overlooked the not unnatural one of foreign
                            alliances with our disloyal citizens.</p>
                        <p>The valuable commerce carried on between the United States and the Island
                            of Cuba is often attended with incidents which require the exercise of
                            great discretion and of mutual forbearance to prevent collisions between
                            the consular authority of the United States, allowed by treaties and the
                            law of nations, and the just sovereign authority of Spain.</p>
                        <p>I desire to state, in a spirit of perfect frankness, what deviation from
                            the usages of revenue and commerce between sovereign states, as
                            recognized by treaty and international law, this government tolerates in
                            the transaction of American commerce in the ports of Cuba, and in all
                            other foreign ports.</p>
                        <p>When an American merchant vessel arrives in a foreign port, having
                            cleared from a port in the United States which, at the time of her
                            departure, was in the possession of the insurgents, and for that reason
                            she could not have obtained regular papers from officers acting under
                            the authority of the United States, and conformable to the laws of
                            Congress, this government does not insist that she shall be
                            denationalized for that reason. But, on the other hand, it does expect
                            that she shall, in the port where she arrives, be treated in all
                            respects as an American vessel and subject to the consular authority of
                            the United States, and that she shall not be treated as a vessel
                            independent of the laws and consular authority of this nation.</p>
                        <p>The waiving of the irregularity of the papers in such cases is consented
                            to <hi rend="italic">ex necessitate</hi>, and for the present time only,
                            and is not to be drawn into precedent. But when this government shall
                            see fit to withdraw this concession, due notice will be given to foreign
                            powers.</p>
                        <p>I send you copies of papers which have just been received from the
                            vice-consul general of the United States residing in Havana, namely,
                            despatches Nos. 56 and 60, dated the 6th and 10 instant, respectively,
                            with their accompaniments.</p>
                        <p>These papers furnish some ground to apprehend that the Spanish
                            authorities in Cuba, misinterpreting, as I am happy to think, the royal
                            edict of the 11th of June, are practicing, or are about to practice,
                            upon the principles of recognizing an insurgent flag upon American
                            vessels, and denying the consular rights and privileges of the United
                            States in reference to such insurgent vessels in Spanish ports.</p>
                        <p>I forbear from preferring any complaint concerning the cases mentioned in
                            these papers, partly for the reason that the transactions mentioned
                            therein are incompletely presented, and more for the reason that I am
                            seeking the prevention of future difficulties by the government of Spain
                            in an amicable spirit. I neither make nor ask explanations in these
                            cases. But I desire that Mr. Calderon Collantes will examine the papers,
                            and, after having satisfied <pb n="275" xml:id="pg_275" facs="0275"/>
                            himself of the true state of the case, will give such directions, if he
                            shall find it necessary to do so, to the colonial authorities as will
                            prevent any recognition whatever in the Spanish ports of the flag of the
                            insurgents, or any disrespect to the flag of the United States, by the
                            Spanish authorities, or any infraction of their consular authority in
                            those ports.</p>

                                I might say accidentally, that a vessel had come, several days
                                before, into the port of Matanzas under the flag of the so-called
                                Confederate States, and, notwithstanding the efforts of our consul
                                there to prevent it, had been admitted by the authorities to entry,
                                and to discharge her cargo, which course had been approved of by the
                                superior authority of the island, I addressed the same day a letter
                                to Mr. Martin, calling upon him for information on the subject. No
                                reply having been received on the 2d instant to my letter, I wrote
                                again, and yesterday morning his answer came to hand. A copy of it
                                and the accompanying papers are herewith enclosed. This
                                correspondence contains all the facts relating to that case.</p>
                            <p>On the same day that I wrote my first letter to Consul Martin I
                                ascertained that the governor general had decided to admit into the
                                ports of the island all vessels arriving under the flag of the
                                insurgents, and to allow them to discharge and take cargo. On the
                                next day I succeeded in obtaining a copy, and it is now accompanied
                                with a translation thereof. This order was transmitted by the
                                intendant general of the army and treasury to the collector general
                                of the maritime revenue; has not been published nor communicated to
                                me in any form; and, although its existence is known to many, the
                                public journals, excepting the Weekly Report in a general way, have
                                not even mentioned it.</p>
                            <p>In a matter of such import, and feeling the conviction that no
                                suggestions of this office would cause the captain general to cancel
                                that order, I have deemed it expedient not to enter into any
                                correspondence or discussion with him without specific instructions
                                from the department; more especially after reading what Mr. Wheaton
                                advances upon the subject, in pages 32, 33, and 34, Elements of
                                International Law. Moreover, as the Spanish government has always
                                denied to consuls any diplomatic power, I felt apprehensive that my
                                first communication on the subject would be unheeded, or
                                acknowledged <pb n="276" xml:id="pg_276" facs="0276"/> with the
                                remarks that the question comes within the province of our
                                respective governments, and to be settled at Washington or
                                Madrid.</p>
                            <p>I have the honor to be, sir, with great respect, your obedient
                                servant,</p>

                                    instant, resolved the following: <list>
                                        <item>1st. All merchant vessels proceeding from and wearing
                                            the flag of the southern confederacy, employed in
                                            legitimate commerce, will be admitted in all the ports
                                            of entry of this island, if the documents they may
                                            present do not cause the slightest suspicion of piracy,
                                            fraud, or any other crime punishable according to the
                                            laws of all nations.</item>
                                        <item>2d. Once in our ports, said vessels will be under the
                                            safeguard of the neutrality proclaimed by the government
                                            of her Majesty the Queen (whom God save) in the royal
                                            decree of the 17th of June, and in this understanding
                                            they cannot be molested by any foreign agent whilst
                                            engaged in their licit operations of entrance and
                                            discharge, loading and departure, in said ports.</item>
                                        <item>3d. Therefore, all the civil, as well as naval and
                                            treasury, authorities in the ports of this island will
                                            consider such vessels, in relation to their admission
                                            and clearance, as vessels proceeding from a foreign
                                            nation which has no accredited consul in this
                                            territory.</item>

                                copies of correspondence between this consulate and various
                                authorities respecting the ship <hi rend="italic">Bamberg</hi> and
                                brig <hi rend="italic">Allen A. Chapman</hi>. By reference to the
                                communications that passed between the commercial court and myself,
                                you will see that I objected to any interference on the part of that
                                court against the action taken by this consulate in respect to the
                                Bamberg. I have learned that on receipt of my letter the court
                                cancelled the order it had issued granting permission for the survey
                                and discharge of the ship, and has referred the matter to the
                                governor general.</p>
                            <p>But on Sunday, the 1st instant, both the “Bamberg” and “A. A.
                                Chapman,” by preconcerted design, prompted by the governor general’s
                                order in relation to vessels arriving in open ports of the island
                                under the flag of the so-called Confederate States, put up rebel
                                flags at their fore and main mastheads. The A, A. Chapman had the
                                rebel flag of the southern confederacy at the fore, and the flag
                                adopted by Louisiana after she seceded from the Union at the main
                                masthead, the American colors hanging from a rope at the stern. The
                                Bamberg had the so-called Louisiana flag at the main masthead, the
                                American at the peak. I consider the so-called flag of Louisiana to
                                be an emblem of rebellion.</p>

                            <p>My correspondence with the captain general and captain of the port
                                will show the course I have deemed proper to adopt, and I trust it
                                will meet with your approbation.</p>
                            <p>I have no answer as yet from the governor general. He has probably
                                referred the case for consultation before adopting a decision to
                                communicate to this consulate.</p>

                                    frequented by American shipmasters the following notice: <list>
                                        <item>“As the President of the United States has officially
                                            declared that certain States of the Union are in a
                                            condition of open rebellion against the government, and
                                            as in time of war <hi rend="italic">treason consists in
                                                giving aid and comfort to the enemy</hi>, therefore
                                            I have to inform all masters of American vessels in the
                                            port of Havana that this consulate cannot give
                                            protection to any vessel claiming to be an American
                                            which hoists the rebel flag on any part thereof.”</item>
                                    </list></p>
                                <p>After some demurring on the part of three or four vessels that
                                    were at the time lying in this port, the practice of hoisting
                                    rebellious flags was discontinued, and the consulate entertained
                                    the hope that thereafter no case would occur requiring the
                                    enforcement of that notice. But in consequence of an order
                                    reported to have been issued recently by your excellency to the
                                    collectors of customs and authorities of the island, in respect
                                    to vessels that may arrive in her ports bearing the flag of the
                                    so-called Confederate States, that offensive practice has been
                                    revived to-day by the ship <hi rend="italic">Bamberg</hi>, James
                                    E. Wilner master, and brigantine <hi rend="italic">Allen A.

                                    America, and have been hitherto enjoying the protection of our
                                    government.</p>
                                <p>Under the present circumstances, and in obedience to the general
                                    instructions of my government, I deem it my duty to withhold
                                    from the two vessels above named the protection of the United
                                    States, consequently to forbid their using in future the flag of
                                    the United States of America. Their papers, evidencing their
                                    former American nationality, which are deposited in my office,
                                    will be forwarded by me to the government of the United States
                                    by the first conveyance.</p>

                                    to advise that as to-morrow is Sunday, when all vessels in the

                                    and keep up during the day their national colors, and those
                                    vessels will probably show their national colors at the peak, I
                                    shall be constrained, in this event, to call upon his excellency
                                    the brigadier captain of the port, and request him to cause the
                                    said flag to be hauled down. I beg leave to repeat that the said
                                    vessels, by the act of their commanders in hoisting rebellious
                                    flags at the fore and main mastheads, have forfeited their
                                    American nationality, and consequently cannot be permitted to
                                    wear the flag of the United States of America.</p>

                                    ignorant of, you have deemed it expedient to withhold from the

                                <p>The said vessels hoisted on yesterday the flag of the United

                                    their respective flags, the Bamberg and A. A. Chapman put up the

                                    let them know what flag they had to put up on Sunday. I told

                                    remain after protection has been taken from them by the

                                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I had the honor to receive on
                                    yesterday your excellency’s polite communication of the same
                                    date, in answer to mine of last Sunday, requesting you to cause
                                    the ship Bamberg and brig A. A. Chapman to haul down the
                                    American colors which they were flying.</p>
                                <p>The reason why those vessels have forfeited the protection of the
                                    United States under which they entered this port is, that their
                                    commanders on the previous Sunday hoisted rebellious flags at
                                    their fore and main mast heads, thereby showing their hostility
                                    to the government whose protection they had been enjoying and
                                    whose flag covered them.</p>
                                <p>In the first part of May last this consulate gave notice that it
                                    could not give protection to any vessel claiming to be American
                                    which hoisted the rebel flag, <hi rend="italic">or any part
                                        thereof</hi>. This was made known to the government of the
                                    United States, who approved of it, directing the consulate not
                                    to recognize as vessels of the United States any that hoisted
                                    any other flag but that prescribed by law.</p>
                                <p>The masters of the “Bamberg” and “Allen A. Chapman” cannot allege
                                    ignorance; they deliberately disregarded the warning given them,
                                    and now must abide the consequences of their act; and having no
                                    longer the right to wear the American, they must remain without
                                    any flag to cover them, for I do not see that they are at
                                    liberty to use the colors of any other nation, being unprovided
                                    with the requisite papers.</p>
                                <p>By the United States registers, which the said vessels had been
                                    sailing under, the Bamberg is owned by— <table rows="7" cols="4">

                                    the captain general’s answer to my last communication in respect
                                    to the ship “Bamberg” and brig “Allen A. Chapman.” I leave the
                                    matter now in the hands of the department, trusting that the
                                    course I adopted towards those vessels will be considered worthy
                                    of your approval.</p>
                                <p>The captain general advised me that the <hi rend="italic"
                                        >Bamberg</hi> is to discharge here. Such articles as
                                    armament and munitions of war will be deposited in the
                                    government stores, and the rest of the cargo will be entered for
                                    consumption. His excellency invited me to attend the inspection
                                    of her cargo, but I deemed it my duty to decline the invitation.
                                    The ship is now at the wharf. It is credited by many that she
                                    has since her arrival discharged arms, which have found their
                                    way to the southern ports. Though I have had a species of
                                    surveillance, nothing has been discovered; and yet I cannot but
                                    believe that arms, &amp;c., have been taken out of her, not from
                                    under the hatches, but from places of concealment in the cabin
                                    and elsewhere, accessible without taking off the hatches. Such
                                    things were, of course, not manifested to this custom-house.</p>
                                <p>I wrote in my last despatch that Captain Laurent, of the A. A.
                                    Chapman, sailed for New Orleans in a French war steamer. I now
                                    confirm the report, and add that he took many letters from here.
                                    In all probability he will return in the same steamer, bringing
                                    powers of attorney for the sale of the “Bamberg” and the “Allen
                                    A. Chapman.”</p>

                                    was prize mate on the Joseph Maxwell, went in her as master.
                                    Hicks, the midshipman of the Sumter, and two other gentlemen,
                                    formerly of the United States navy, went as passengers in the

                                        Superintendency of the Exchequer of the ever-faithful Island
                                        of Cuba</hi>.</p>
                                <p>I transmit to you herewith, duly authenticated, a copy of the
                                    report made by his excellency the general commanding this naval
                                    station, in accordance with the opinion of the legal adviser of
                                    the same, upon the subject of the communication of the 13th
                                    instant, wherein you were pleased to answer mine of the 12th. I
                                    fully concur in the opinions given by his excellency and
                                    pursuant thereto I address, under this same date, her Catholic
                                    Majesty’s minister at Washington, in order that, by an
                                    understanding with the government, may be fixed, in a precise
                                    and definite manner, the course which, in cases analogous to
                                    those of the “Bamberg” and “Allan A. Chapman,” should be
                                    pursued, respectively, by you and by the superior authority of
                                    Cuba. Thus barren debates will be avoided, and a course adopted
                                    consonant with the loyalty and harmony which this government
                                    always uses in the treatment of international affairs.</p>
                                <p>In the meanwhile I will state to you that, for the purpose of
                                    exhibiting practically my desire of acceding as far as possible
                                    to your requests, I have made known, confidentially, to the
                                    captains that they are not to hoist any more the flag of the
                                    United States; and they have pledged to the captain of the port
                                    their word of honor not to do it.</p>
                                <p>This communication should terminate here, inasmuch as I have
                                    stated I cannot accede in an official form to what is required
                                    by you, without anything else being thereby implied, but that I
                                    do not believe the moment has arrived for the aid of
                                    jurisdiction that you solicit. But I cannot allow to pass
                                    unnoticed two remarks made, respectively, in the communications
                                    of the 1st and 13th instants, without setting forth in regard to
                                    them my manner of appreciating them. The first is the relation
                                    you find between the cases of the “Bamberg” and the “Allan” and
                                    the circular, which you say was issued by my authority, to the
                                    collectors of customs respecting the toleration towards the flag
                                    of the seceded States. I will frankly confess to you that I find
                                    no connexion or link between the two subjects. In the first the
                                    object is not to injure the interests of our national trade,
                                    because you already understand Spain never could have bound
                                    herself to discontinue her commercial transactions with the
                                    south, whatever may be the state of its internal relations with
                                    the north. In the other the matter in question is that you
                                    require two vessels to be notified that they shall not use the
                                    flag under which they entered the port, which was hitherto, and
                                    still is officially, according to the papers they produced, that
                                    of their true nationality.</p>
                                <p>The second remark is that my declining to make the notification
                                    called for might be interpreted as a species of opposition to
                                    your consular authority. Upon this particular I will make only
                                    two observations. One is that you are well aware that in all
                                    questions hitherto occurring the government of this island has
                                    not spared any means of showing its deference to that of the
                                    United States, represented by you; examples of which might be
                                    adduced, which I omit, not to make this writing too long. The
                                    second is that such opposition could not in any way be supposed,
                                    when the subject in question solely is that you yourself wish to
                                    cut off vessels which till now have belonged to the United
                                    States, and have been by you, in conjunction with your
                                    government, denationalized, by the fact of taking their papers
                                    from them. I consider as sufficiently answered the observations
                                    you make upon the subject, without my entertaining, even
                                    remotely, the idea that the consulate could have doubted for a
                                    single moment of the good faith of this government, <pb n="283"
                                        xml:id="pg_283" facs="0283"/> in the same manner that I have
                                    not doubted or will ever doubt of that which animates you, whose
                                    high qualities in all respects I take pleasure in
                                    acknowledging.</p>
                                <p>God preserve you many years.</p>

                                    new communication in which the consul general of the United

                                    American flag by the ship “Bamberg” and brig “Allan A. Chapman,”

                                            insist in considering that the aid of jurisdiction
                                            which, from the superior authority of the island, the
                                            consul of the United States again requires in respect to
                                            the ship ‘Bamberg’ and brig ‘Allan’ should be based or
                                            justified upon the opposition or resistance of the
                                            captains of those vessels to the orders and instructions
                                            given them directly by the consul himself in the circle
                                            of his consular functions. And this not from respect to
                                            the principle of neutrality, which has no application
                                            nor could be violated in the present case, but because
                                            his excellency the governor, captain general, is not the
                                            medium of communication between the consul of the United
                                            States and the masters of the vessels of his nation, nor
                                            has there been committed on board of the ship ‘Bamberg’
                                            or the brig ‘Allan A. Chapman’ any act which was a
                                            disturbance of order or of the peace of the port, or
                                            which has violated the laws of the country—the only case
                                            that would justify the officious action of the local
                                            authorities against the captains and crews of those
                                            vessels. It is very true that every government has the
                                            exclusive right of prescribing the flags that their
                                            vessels are to use, and <hi rend="italic">which</hi>
                                            they are not to use; but it is also true that the
                                            infraction of the laws of a country, while it does not
                                            affect others, is only to be proved in the country that
                                            made those laws. The ship ‘Bamberg’ and the brig
                                            ‘Allan,’ as the consul himself states, were received in
                                            this port as vessels of his nation duly authorized. Both
                                            have hoisted the flags of the United States at the
                                            stern, which is the principal place for the national
                                            flag; those which are said to be used at the same time
                                            at the fore and main mast heads have no official
                                            character or signification. If the use of them on any
                                            part of a vessel, or for whatever purpose, constitutes a
                                            crime in the eyes of the government of the United
                                            States, it should be tried before the courts of that
                                            nation. Had the consul limited himself to ask that
                                            through the captaincy of the port the captain should be
                                            ordered not to hoist those flags together with the one
                                            that denoted their nationality, he could have easily
                                            obtained this proof of deference to the American flag,
                                            and of consideration to his government. But in lieu
                                            thereof the consul has condemned those vessels to
                                            deprivation of their legitimate flag—a penalty which
                                            constitutes an indefinite embargo of the same in this
                                            port, and a simulated confiscation of the property—a <pb
                                                n="284" xml:id="pg_284" facs="0284"/> penalty that
                                            does not affect the delinquent captains, but the owners
                                            and shippers, who may perhaps have no culpability in the
                                            proceedings of the former. So summary a proceeding
                                            against the property is not in conformity to our usages,
                                            and every species of confiscation is forbidden by our
                                            laws. For this reason the consul ought not to deem it
                                            strange that the superior authority of this island
                                            should hesitate to be officious in a foreign affair
                                            which is initiated with such grave proceedings on the
                                            part of him who has in this place the character of
                                            commercial agent to protect and support the interests of
                                            the citizens of the United States, and not the severe
                                            office of a judge. It is likewise well founded that if
                                            there is responsibility involved in the consul’s action,
                                            it belongs solely to the government of his nation to
                                            demand it of him; but for the same reason his and his
                                            only should be the responsibility; and the consul should
                                            not unnecessarily demand the foreign assistance, as the
                                            authority rendering it might find itself involved
                                            therein. The apprehension of being disregarded by the
                                            captains is not a sufficient reason to justify that
                                            assistance, which, being extemporaneous, would have a
                                            character of officious and voluntary. As the consul has
                                            already referred the solution of this affair to
                                            Washington, transmitting the registers of the ‘Bamberg’
                                            and the ‘Allan,’ he might await the resolution of his
                                            government, which may perhaps save all future
                                            difficulty; and to this end it might be expedient that
                                            his excellency the governor, captain general, should
                                            also, with a copy of all the communications and reports,
                                            bring the subject before his excellency the minister of
                                            her Catholic Majesty in Washington, in order that his
                                            excellency may be posted up for the event of any
                                            communication being addressed to him thereupon by that
                                            government, or may avail himself of the occasion, should
                                            it present itself, of avoiding other reclamations of the
                                            same nature from the consul, if he deems it expedient,
                                            or considers himself authorized therefor.
                                            Notwithstanding all that is stated, your excellency will
                                            be pleased to inform his excellency the governor,
                                            captain general, what you may deem most proper.”</item>

                        <p>After having closed our conversation on the Mexican business, I called
                            Mr. Calderon’s attention to a report going through the American and
                            European press that Spain was about to recognize the independence of the
                            Southern Confederacy and to break up the blockade of our southern ports.
                            I added that it was impossible for me to believe that Spain could
                            entertain any such intentions, and inquired whether anything had
                            occurred to give rise to such a rumor.</p>
                        <pb n="285" xml:id="pg_285" facs="0285"/>
                        <p>Mr. Calderon replied with the strongest protestations of good faith and
                            friendship towards the United States. He assured me that nothing could
                            be further from the intentions of her Majesty’s government than to
                            depart from the policy indicated in her Majesty’s proclamation of
                            neutrality. But, he added, there are things—and, interrupting himself,
                            he asked me whether I had not, within the last two days, received
                            despatches from my government. I answered in the negative. Then he went
                            to his desk and took out a paper, which turned out to be a copy of your
                            despatch (No. 30) addressed to me, bearing date September 18. This
                            despatch, as he said, had been communicated by you to Mr. Tassara, and
                            Mr. Tassara had sent it to him. He handed it to me, and you may well
                            imagine that I was somewhat disagreeably surprised. Instead of my
                            communicating this despatch to him, he communicated it to me, and I
                            found myself obliged to confess that I had not the least official
                            knowledge of a matter to which, according to the contents of the
                            despatch, my government attached the highest importance. Mr. Calderon
                            informed me that he had received the document the day before; that he
                            had at once inquired whether any report had been sent in by the captain
                            general of Cuba; and that, there being none, he was not prepared to give
                            an answer to your despatch. I replied that I would not ask for an answer
                            until I should have received the original of your instructions and the
                            reports of our consular officers on the Island of Cuba; that as soon as
                            I should be in possession of these documents, I would lay them before
                            him, and then discuss the matter with him in all its bearings. He
                            replied that this would be agreeable to him, but that it would be
                            impossible for him to give a definite answer without having heard from
                            the captain general of Cuba.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: After having waited for the arrival of
                            your despatch No. 30 until yesterday, I deemed it necessary to make an
                            effort to obtain an answer from Mr. Calderon as to the general merits of
                            the case. I therefore called on Mr. Calderon yesterday, and have the
                            honor to transmit a report of our conversation.</p>
                        <p>I noticed, in the course of that conversation, that Mr. Calderon,
                            although he denied the receipt of official communications from the
                            captain general of Cuba, seemed to be well informed of what had happened
                            there, while I had no other knowledge of the facts referred to in your
                            despatch than a general impression gathered from newspaper statements,
                            which, in this case, had been distressingly indefinite and
                            contradictory.</p>
                        <p>You will notice that, in my conversation with Mr. Calderon, I confined
                            myself entirely to putting questions, partly because I was ignorant of
                            what actually had happened, and partly because I consider it impolitic,
                            under present circumstances, to join issue with foreign governments on
                            things <pb n="286" xml:id="pg_286" facs="0286"/> which may or may not
                            happen. The latter is especially applicable to the case under

                                1861.</head>
                            <p>Mr. Schurz informed Mr. Calderon that the original of Mr. Seward’s
                                despatch [No. 30,] a copy of which had been forwarded by Mr. Tassara
                                to him, (Mr. Calderon,) had not reached the American legation, and
                                that he was therefore unable to lay before Mr. Calderon the reports
                                of the consular officers of the United States alluded to in the
                                despatch; but that he considered it important that a matter which
                                was so apt to lead to disagreeable consequences should be promptly
                                disposed of, and that he therefore requested Mr. Calderon to state
                                the views of the Spanish government in a general manner, even if it
                                was impossible, in the absence of special information, to judge of
                                the exact merits of the cases which had occasioned Mr. Seward’s
                                despatch.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Calderon replied that he had received no official communication
                                on this subject from the captain general of Cuba, but that he was
                                prepared to make the following statement:</p>
                            <p>Spain had followed, in relation to vessels coming from the ports of
                                the so-called Southern Confederacy, the same rules of action which
                                she had adopted in the case of vessels clearing from the ports of
                                the kingdom of the Two Sicilies after the assumption of royal
                                authority in that kingdom by King Victor Emanuel. It was well known
                                that Spain had not recognized the so-called kingdom of Italy, and
                                that the consular agents of King Francis I were still exercising
                                their functions in the Spanish ports. Nevertheless, Spain did not
                                oblige the masters of vessels arriving in Spanish ports from the
                                ports of the kingdom of Naples to submit to the authority of the
                                consuls of Francis I, but permitted them to address themselves
                                either to these or to the consular officers of King Victor Emanuel,
                                as they saw fit. But this permission given to vessels coming from
                                the Neapolitan ports to transact their business with the consuls of
                                Victor Emanuel was by no means intended to imply a recognition of
                                the Italian kingdom; for Spain recognized in the kingdom of the Two
                                Sicilies no other authority as lawful and legitimate than that of
                                King Francis I.</p>
                            <p>In like manner it was permitted to vessels coming from the ports now
                                under the control of the so-called Confederate States, upon their
                                arrival in Spanish ports, to address themselves to the consular
                                authorities of the United States, if they saw fit to do so; but, as
                                in the case of vessels coming from Neapolitan ports, Spain did not
                                think proper to oblige them to do so. This practice, however, was by
                                no means intended to imply, in any manner, a recognition of the
                                so-called Confederate States as an independent nation.</p>
                            <p>But in the case of these vessels the action of Spain was still more
                                justifiable than in the case of the Neapolitan vessels. The
                                government of the United States was, with its naval forces,
                                blockading the southern ports, and it was their business to see to
                                it that no vessels should escape from the ports thus guarded. It
                                could not be expected of Spain to supply the deficiencies of the
                                maritime police of the United States, nor was it reasonable to
                                expect <pb n="287" xml:id="pg_287" facs="0287"/> that she should
                                turn away from her ports vessels engaged in ordinary peaceful
                                commerce, and which had not been able to obtain regular papers even
                                if they had wanted to do so. Nor could Spain oblige such vessels by
                                force to submit to the authority of the consular officers of the
                                United States. Spain was acting solely with a view to the protection
                                of her commercial interests, and nothing else.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Schurz replied that the only ground upon which such proceedings
                                could legitimately be placed was that of necessity, and asked Mr.
                                Calderon whether this was the ground taken by the government of
                                Spain.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Calderon replied that it was. It was nothing but an <hi
                                    rend="italic">ex necessitate</hi> proceeding, and that as soon
                                as that necessity ceased the Spanish government would cease to
                                follow that rule of action.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Schurz asked whether the Spanish government would admit into its
                                ports vessels without papers regularly issued by the authorities of
                                the United States as soon as the authority of the government of the
                                United States should be re-established in the southern ports.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Calderon answered that they would not, because then the necessity
                                would cease. But he would not admit the ground taken by Mr. Seward
                                in his despatch, that the admission of vessels without regular
                                papers under the actual state of things depended on a “concession”
                                on the part of the government of the United States, which might be
                                granted or withdrawn at pleasure. The Spanish government claimed a
                                right to adhere to its rule of action as long as the necessity
                                existed. But he protested most emphatically against the construction
                                placed upon this rule as implying a recognition of the so-called
                                Confederate States; the government of Spain did not think of taking
                                such a step and of interrupting the friendly relations existing
                                between the two countries, the preservation of which was undoubtedly
                                considered important by the United States, and had always been
                                sincerely desired by Spain.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Schurz replied that, as to these peaceful relations, the United
                                States desired to preserve them with equal sincerity, not because
                                they were afraid of a conflict, but because they loved peace. He
                                added that if Spain in this case followed an established policy,
                                founded on precedent, he did not wish to carry the discussion
                                further at present, especially in the absence of all reliable
                                information as to the recent occurrences in the ports of Cuba; but
                                he wished to say that while the United States would set up no
                                unreasonble pretensions, any act on the part of a foreign government
                                which might be justly interpreted as a recognition of the
                                independence of the States now in rebellion against the legitimate
                                government of the North American republic would necessarily and
                                inevitably lead to a rupture.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Calderon repeated that no such intention was entertained by the
                                government of Spain, which entertained none but friendly feelings
                                towards the United States. He informed Mr. Schurz that he was about
                                to address a despatch on this subject to Mr. Tassara, which the
                                latter would be instructed to read to Mr. Seward.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Last night I called upon Mr. Calderon, for
                            the purpose of reading to him the memorandum of our conversation of the
                            16th instant. After having suggested some additions, which were
                            forthwith incorporated into the report, <pb n="288" xml:id="pg_288"
                                facs="0288"/> he approved it as correct. He informed me that he had
                            meanwhile received an official communication from the captain general of
                            Cuba on the occurrences which had occasioned your despatch No. 30, and
                            that he would read it to me at our next interview. He wanted to prove to
                            me that the Spanish government had acted with entire fairness and
                            loyalty in this transaction. I informed him that the London “Times,” of
                            October 16, contained the following telegraphic despatch:</p>
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“There are several vessels loading ammunition at Havana for the
                                confederates.”</p>
                        </quote>
                        <p>And asked him whether he knew anything of this.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Calderon exclaimed at once, with great warmth: “That is impossible;
                            it cannot be true. This would be a violation of the royal decree of the
                            17th of June, and will never be tolerated. General Serrano cannot have
                            permitted this.”</p>
                        <p>I replied that I was happy to hear him express his opinion so
                            unequivocally and emphatically; for it would be impossible for the
                            government of the United States to look on quietly while the Cuban ports
                            were used as war depots for the rebels.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Calderon assured me repeatedly that this telegraphic despatch would
                            most certainly turn out to be unfounded, and reiterated in very strong
                            language the assurance of the loyal and friendly feelings of the Spanish
                            government towards the United States, and of its firm determination to
                            adhere faithfully to the principles laid down in the royal decree.</p>
                        <p>I am, sir, with high respect, your obedient servant,</p>

                        <p>Spain is engaged in her proceedings against Mexico. The United States are
                            repressing an insurrection which, while it has attained formidable
                            dimensions at home, reveals itself abroad in efforts to instigate
                            foreign intervention. While it would be eminently desirable to make new
                            friends, or at least to fortify existing friendships with foreign
                            nations, the circumstances are so unpropitious as to make us content
                            with averting new misunderstandings and consequent collisions.</p>
                        <p>You have correctly interpreted to Mr. Calderon Collantes the public
                            sentiment of this country in regard to Spain. We not only seek no
                            controversy with her, but are desirous to stand in the most friendly
                            relations towards her. We are watchful, as we must be, of every fact or
                            circumstance that seems to indicate a disposition on her part to favor
                            or encourage the insurrection with which we are contending. We know our
                            ability to maintain the integrity of the republic, and we intend to
                            maintain it. We desire that when it shall have been completely
                            re-established it shall be found that nothing has been done in the
                            meantime by Spain, or by any foreign nation, to serve as causes for
                            alienation. We are a peaceful state. Indeed, we think that the American
                            Union is the guarantee of peace to the whole world. But like every other
                            state we are jealous of our rights, and must maintain them.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Calderon Collantes could hardly have a better assurance of our desire
                            for peace with Spain than the fact, which you might communicate to him,
                            that even the unjust and ungenerous strictures of the Spanish press,
                            which so naturally and so justly drew out your remonstrance, failed to
                            excite the least sensibility on the part of this government.</p>
                        <p>This government neither has now, nor is likely to have, any schemes, or,
                            indeed, any purpose, of conquest or aggrandizement. It seeks to extend
                            its influence throughout this hemisphere and the world, not by the
                            sword, but by commerce and by postal communication. It has practically
                            guaranteed Cuba to Spain for many years heretofore, and it has no design
                            against that possession or any other possession of Spain now; but it
                            will not look with favor upon any policy that shall make that island the
                            fulcrum of a lever for overthrowing either this Union or the
                            institutions of human freedom and self-government which are identified
                            with its existence.</p>
                        <p>We want a commercial treaty with Spain, and are willing to adopt a
                            liberal principle of reciprocity to secure it; but we shall not urge
                            such a measure now, when both parties are too deeply engaged to consider
                            the matter with the intense attention necessary to a mutual
                            understanding upon points so difficult.</p>
                        <p>We should be glad to effect a measure for the adjustment of mutual
                            commercial claims, but we cannot admit that the Amistad claim has any
                            foundation in justice or moral right. It is for Spain to refuse to treat
                            with us upon this ground if she thinks it sufficient. We can only regret
                            it, and wait for her to reconsider the subject.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your despatch of October 17 (No. 30) has
                            been received. I am surprised at the miscarriage of my despatch No. 30.
                            I have, however, directed a copy of it to be sent to you. Mr. Tassara
                            has shown me certain explanations made to him by the captain general of
                            Cuba, and I have in turn modified the opinion which I had formed
                            concerning his action in relation to the matter complained of by the
                            vice-consul general. I do not think it necessary to press the subject of
                            my despatch No. 30 under these circumstances. With the gradual action of
                            the government in restoring its authority at home, I look to see less
                            disposition to treat it with disrespect abroad.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I am to instruct you what to do, and of
                            course what not to do, as resident minister of the United States at
                            Rome. In order to understand the wishes and expectations of the
                            President, please consider first the condition of Rome, and then the
                            condition of the United States.</p>
                        <p>Rome, to a degree hardly comprehended in this country, is protected by
                            the veneration of a large portion of mankind for his Holiness as the
                            expounder of faith and the guardian of religion. Nevertheless, his
                            government is surrounded by the elements of political revolution.</p>
                        <p>The United States are on the verge of civil war. It happens to them now,
                            as it happened to ancient Rome, and has happened to many other
                            republics, that they must make the trial whether liberty can be
                            preserved while dominion is widely extended. What then shall we say or
                            do in regard to Rome, or what ought Rome to say or do in regard to
                            us?</p>
                        <p>Assure the government of his Holiness that the President and the people
                            of the United States desire to cultivate with it the most cordial and
                            friendly relations; that we will not violate the friendship already so
                            happily existing by any intervention in the domestic affairs of the
                            States of the Church. Assure his Holiness that it is the settled habit
                            of this government to leave to all other countries the unquestioned
                            regulation of their own internal concerns, being convinced that
                            intrusion by a foreign nation anywhere tends only to embarrass rather
                            than aid the best designs of the friends of freedom, religion and
                            humanity, by impairing the unity of the state exclusively
                            interested.</p>
                        <p>What ought Rome to do in regard to the United States? Just what I have
                            thus said they will do in regard to Rome. We could not ask or consent to
                            receive more, and the government of his Holiness will not propose to do
                            less, for he is a friend to peace, to good order, and to the cause of
                            human nature, which is now, as it always has been, our cause.</p>
                        <p>Let the government of Rome set this example and exercise its great
                            influence in favor of a course of natural justice among nations, and the
                            United States will still remain at peace with the whole world, and
                            continue hereafter, as hitherto, to be the home of civil and religious
                            liberty, and an asylum for the exiled and the oppressed.</p>

                            29th instant, has been addressed to your successor, Mr. King, of which,
                            as it relates to a subject of present moment, I have deemed it expedient
                            to send you a transcript, which you will find enclosed. It is thought
                            desirable that the views therein expressed should be communicated to the
                            Papal government without delay.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inform you that I left
                            my post of duty on my return home on the 6th day of June last. But
                            before doing so, according to the tenor of my despatch, (No. 48,) I
                            communicated the contents of the instructions of the department to Mr.
                            King (No. 2) to the government of his holiness.</p>
                        <p>I translated all those points of the despatch which I thought necessary
                            into Italian, and left it with his eminence as a memoranda. I informed
                            his eminence, the secretary of state, that although the despatch was
                            addressed to my successor, I should be most happy to take charge of a
                            reply, as Mr. King had not yet arrived in Rome. His eminence said that
                            he could not know the contents of instructions of the government of the
                            United States to Mr. King except privately. Officially Mr. King should
                            be received before any communication directed to him could be noticed.
                            It was impossible for him to reply; a reply was not appropriate to the
                            occasion.</p>
                        <p>I suggested that he could state to me privately his views, which I would
                            communicate to the government, although my official position was
                            ended.</p>
                        <p>His eminence consented to this, and then said, in substance, as follows:
                            He said that the Catholics of the United States, as Catholics, as a
                            church, would take no part in the matter; it would not be proper for
                            them to do so. As citizens he had no doubt they would all feel a great
                            concern at our internal dissensions. He added, you are aware that the
                            government of his holiness concerns itself mainly in spiritual matters,
                            but we are the supporters of law and order everywhere. He said he
                            regarded the United States as a great and free country, and he hoped
                            that I would be assured that the kind sentiments of our government to
                            the Holy See were appreciated and reciprocated.</p>
                        <p>I do not pretend to give either the words or a verbal translation of the
                            expressions of his eminence, but I am sure that I have fairly stated the
                            substance of the conversation.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps it is not improper for me, in concluding my mission, to say that
                            I parted from his holiness with a profound sense of the kindness and
                            consideration I had always received from him, and with sentiments of the
                            highest regard and esteem for his character.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to remain, very truly yours,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Nations, like individuals, have three
                            prominent wants; first, freedom; secondly, prosperity; thirdly,
                            friends.</p>
                        <p>The United States early secured the two first objects by the exercise of
                            courage and enterprise. But, although they have always practiced
                            singular moderation, they nevertheless have been slow in winning
                            friends.</p>
                        <p>Russia presents an exceptional case. That power was an early, and it has
                            always been a constant friend. This relationship between two nations, so
                            remote and so unlike, has excited much surprise, but the explanation is
                            obvious.</p>
                        <p>Russia, like the United States, is an improving and expanding empire. Its
                            track is eastward, while that of the United States is westward. The two
                            nations, therefore, never come into rivalry or conflict. Each carries
                            civilization to the new regions it enters, and each finds itself
                            occasionally resisted by states jealous of its prosperity, or alarmed by
                            its aggrandizement. Russia and the United States may remain good friends
                            until, each having made a circuit of half the globe in opposite
                            directions, they shall meet and greet each other in the region where
                            civilization first began, and where, after so many ages, it has become
                            now lethargic and helpless. It will be your pleasing duty to confirm and
                            strengthen these traditional relations of amity and friendship.</p>
                        <p>Assure his Imperial Majesty that the President and the people of the
                            United States have observed with admiration and sympathy the great and
                            humane efforts he has so recently made for the material and moral
                            improvement of his empire by the extension of telegraphs and railroads,
                            and by removing the disabilities of slavery.</p>
                        <p>Make it your duty to inquire whether the sluggish course of commerce
                            between the two nations cannot be quickened, and its volume increased.
                            Russia is capable of receiving cotton and tobacco from us in much larger
                            quantities than we now send. The former is not a staple of that country,
                            and although it produces tobacco, yet not of so high a quality as that
                            which we send abroad, and of which Russia consumes more than any other
                            nation.</p>
                        <p>We can well receive from that country increased quantities of hemp and
                            flax, tallow, and other productions in exchange.</p>
                        <p>Russia is liberal to our inventors, engineers, and machinists; but
                            vicious adventurers too often abuse this generous encouragement by
                            fraudulent practices. See if you can devise a plan for correcting this
                            evil. I suggest that it might be done by effecting free interchange of
                            newspapers and scientific journals.</p>
                        <p>A Russian landing at New York can cross this western continent without
                            once being required to exhibit a passport. Why will not Russia extend
                            the same hospitality to us, and enable the American citizen, when he
                            debarks at Revel, to cross the eastern continent in like manner
                            unquestioned. The American abroad is not more than the Russian a
                            propagandist, and while Russia pursues the general policy of the present
                            reign it can have nothing to fear from American influences.</p>
                        <p>In another paper which accompanies this your attention is especially
                            directed <pb n="294" xml:id="pg_294" facs="0294"/> to the subject of
                            amendments of the international code of maritime law in regard to
                            neutrals, proposed in 1856 by the congress which was then sitting at
                            Paris, of which body Russia was a member.</p>
                        <p>If nations were now, as in ancient times, morally independent and
                            unsocial, the President would not have occasion to address our
                            representatives in Europe on the painful events which are subjects of
                            intense solicitude at home. But the world has, in a measured degree,
                            become one commonwealth. Nations favor or discourage political changes
                            in other nations, and exercise influences upon their success and
                            fortunes, sometimes from interest, sometimes from sympathy, and
                            sometimes from caprice.</p>
                        <p>Although this general fact is so well understood, yet the President
                            indulges so uncompromising a sense of the national dignity and honor,
                            that he, nevertheless, would not suffer a word on the subject to escape
                            from the lips of one of our ministers abroad, if our discontented
                            fellow-citizens who have raised the standard of insurrection had not
                            sent out their agents to propitiate foreign powers and engage their
                            co-operation in the desperate attempt they are making to overthrow the
                            institutions and the liberties of the American people.</p>
                        <p>You will, of course, meet such agents in Russia. They have some
                            advantages in Europe of which you should be warned.</p>
                        <p>What is now the insurrectionary party in the United States has been for
                            near forty years, and until the fourth day of March last, the dominant
                            party in the administration of this government. It has acquaintances and
                            friendships in high places there, the growth of long intercourse in
                            foreign courts, with the prestige of political authority. The late
                            minister to Russia returned, however, to be the governor of South
                            Carolina at the moment when that State was in the very act of
                            inaugurating the present revolution.</p>
                        <p>When those agents shall present themselves at St. Petersburg, his
                            Imperial Majesty, before granting them a hearing, will naturally address
                            himself to you, and will ask you: What is the cause of this revolution?
                            What is its object? Why does the government resist it? What is the
                            present condition of the revolution, and what are its prospects? What
                            are the probable consequences of its success, or of its failure? And,
                            finally, what does the the President desire or expect from his Imperial
                            Majesty in regard to it?</p>
                        <p>The President will not forget, nor will he allow you to forget, that he
                            is the magistrate of the insurrectionary, as he is also of the loyal
                            States, and in all his dealings concerning the plotters, aiders, and
                            abettors of this great conspiracy he will constantly remember that the
                            people in whose name they act, and whose power they abuse, are still
                            citizens of the republic. He believes, however, that you may answer all
                            the questions thus contemplated without compromising the impartiality of
                            this government, or the dignity and honor of the federal Union.</p>
                        <p>As to the cause of the revolution, you will inform the Russian government
                            that African slavery was found existing in nearly all the States, when,
                            seventy years ago, they met, and by a written Constitution established
                            that Union. It was expected that under the operation of moral, social,
                            and political influences then existing the practice of slavery would
                            soon cease. The foreign slave trade was adopted to favor that end, while
                            the vacant common domain which lay between the Alleghany mountains and
                            the Mississippi river was shut up against slavery by legislation then
                            believed to be effective and eternal.</p>
                        <p>Cotton soon afterward became an object of great commercial demand; the
                            soil and climate of those States of this Union which are situate near
                            and upon the Gulf of Mexico were favorable to its growth, and African
                            slave labor existed therein practically to the exclusion of the labor of
                            free white men.</p>
                        <pb n="295" xml:id="pg_295" facs="0295"/>
                        <p>The raising of slaves of the African race to supply the wants of the
                            cotton growing States became a prominent economical interest in the
                            grain and tobacco growing States adjacent to the former class of States.
                            The interest of slavery became at once the basis of the policy, and even
                            of the polity of these two classes of States, and by political, social,
                            and commercial connexions those interests secured a strong and even
                            controlling influence throughout the whole Union, and even in all
                            foreign commercial countries. This interest of slavery was jealous and
                            apprehensive of danger from the growth of the democratic element of free
                            white labor, which all the while has been constantly augmented by native
                            increase and immigration from Europe.</p>
                        <p>The several States in the Union, whatever be their population, enjoy
                            equal representation in the Senate. Congress may, and from manifest
                            causes must, admit new States into the Union. The slave holding interest
                            naturally desired to extend slavery and multiply slave States. The free
                            States necessarily desired, as they constitutionally might, to prevent
                            the extension of slavery in regions where it did not exist or had been
                            abolished, and so to multiply free States.</p>
                        <p>The acquisitions of new domain by purchases from France, Spain, and
                            Mexico, to be the seat of future States, opened a wide theatre for this
                            contest, and the contest itself by degrees came to be a chief feature in
                            the debates of Congress, and in the canvasses of the popular
                            elections.</p>
                        <p>The interest of slavery was consolidated and compact in the slave States,
                            and acquired great power by threatening that if overruled those States
                            would secede and dissolve the Union, which the free States
                            traditionally, as well as justly, regarded as fatal to the prosperity,
                            safety, and happiness of the whole American people. Statesmen of all
                            classes and all parties, on that ground, continually conceded, and
                            Congress and the judiciary constantly compromised with the slave
                            interest, in opposition to steadily advancing popular convictions of
                            right, duty, and patriotism, until at last all legal barriers against
                            the extension of slavery were, in one way or in another, thrown down.
                            Transactions so unnatural roused the interest opposed to slavery to
                            renewed effort in the popular election of the last year, and that
                            election resulted in the choice of the present incumbent for the office
                            of President of the United States, although without a majority of either
                            house of Congress identified with this interest.</p>
                        <p>The party of slavery, which had thus, for the first time, been
                            distinctly, though not completely, unsuccessful in a popular election,
                            instantly, and four months before the constitutional period assigned for
                            the inauguration of the new President, took an appeal from the verdict
                            of the people, rendered through the ballot-box, to the sword, and
                            organized a revolution with civil war.</p>
                        <p>Such was the cause of the revolution. Its object is to create a nation
                            built upon the principle that African slavery is necessary, just, wise,
                            and beneficent, and that it may and must be expanded over the central
                            portion of the American continent and islands without check or
                            resistance, at whatever cost and sacrifice to the welfare and happiness
                            of the human race.</p>
                        <p>The government of the United States resists this revolution for reasons
                            too many to be hastily set forth.</p>
                        <p>It is absolutely unnecessary. All existing interests of slavery are
                            protected now, as heretofore, by our federal and State constitutions,
                            sufficiently to prevent the destruction or molestation of the
                            institution of slavery where it exists, by federal or foreign
                            intervention, without the consent of the parties concerned. The policy
                            of fortifying and extending slavery in regions where it has no existence
                            is injurious, vicious, and eminently dangerous to our own country and to
                            mankind.</p>
                        <pb n="296" xml:id="pg_296" facs="0296"/>
                        <p>Dismemberment of the Union, however effected and for whatever cause,
                            would be destruction of the safety, happiness, and welfare of the whole
                            American people, and would, by its influence, render the present
                            establishment of any popular form of government impracticable in an age
                            and in a region where no other than just such a form of government is
                            known or could be tolerated.</p>
                        <p>The condition of the revolution is this, namely: In the United States the
                            people always exercise a direct and potential influence upon the
                            government. They were at first incredulous of the fact that a revolution
                            so unnecessary, so unnatural, and so fatal, was seriously intended. They
                            saw it move steadily on, but were beguiled by the appeals of mediators,
                            who proposed at once to avert disunion and to prevent the calamity of
                            civil war. The government was temporarily demoralized by the presence of
                            the conspirators in controlling numbers in the administration, in
                            Congress, in the army, in the navy, and in every department of the
                            public service. But at last, when it became clearly revealed that
                            nothing less than subversion of the federal republic would satisfy the
                            insurgents, and that the forbearance and moderation of the government
                            towards them were abused to the purpose of preparing a deadly and
                            desolating war, the loyalty of the people suddenly awakened; the
                            government, sustained by popular enthusiasm and energy, has put forth
                            all the necessary power; the revolution has at once been checked, and it
                            is no longer doubtful that it will be promptly and effectually
                            suppressed.</p>
                        <p>It had its origin in disappointment; and it depends for continuance only
                            on popular passions, the occasion for which has passed away, while such
                            passions are not in harmony with the character, sentiments, and habits
                            of the American people.</p>
                        <p>When it shall be seen, as it soon will be, that the effort to overthrow
                            the government is hopeless, the misguided citizens who have joined
                            themselves to the revolutionary standard will resume their accustomed
                            habits of reason and reflection, and the Union, having surmounted a new
                            and formidable danger, will be stronger than ever before.</p>
                        <p>What would be the consequences of the revolution if it could be
                            successful? The answer is obvious. At first, division of this great and
                            hitherto peaceful and happy country into two hostile and belligerent
                            republics. Later, a resolution of each of those two republics into an
                            indefinite number of petty, hostile, and belligerent States. Local
                            jealousies, continually agitated, would, early or late, be aggravated by
                            the horrors of a servile war, filling the whole country with desolation.
                            The end would be military despotism, compelling peace where free
                            government had proved an absolute and irretrievable failure.</p>
                        <p>The equilibrium of the nations, maintained by this republic, on the one
                            side, against the European system on the other continent, would be lost,
                            and the struggles of nations in that system for dominion in this
                            hemisphere and on the high seas, which constitutes the chief portion of
                            the world’s history in the eighteenth century, would be renewed. The
                            progress of freedom and civilization, now so happily inaugurated, would
                            be arrested, and the hopes of humanity which this the present century
                            has brought forth would be disappointed and indefinitely postponed.</p>
                        <p>What will be the consequences of the failure of the revolution? The
                            continuance of the country in the happy career that it has pursued so
                            auspiciously, to the repose of nations and to the improvement of the
                            condition of mankind.</p>
                        <p>What does the President require or expect from the Emperor of Russia?
                            That sovereign is expected to do just what this government does in
                            regard to Russia and all other nations. It refrains from all
                            intervention whatever in their political affairs; and it expects the
                            same just and generous forbearance <pb n="297" xml:id="pg_297"
                                facs="0297"/> in return. It has too much self-respect to ask more,
                            and too high a sense of its rights to accept anything less.</p>
                        <p>The high character of the government of Russia warrants these moderate
                            and just expectations.</p>

                        <p>Here, as elsewhere in Europe, the late agitations in the United States,
                            which have followed the election of the republican candidates for
                            President and Vice-President, have been observed with the deepest
                            interest. The President’s message was published in full as soon as it
                            was received, together with copious comments on it from the leading
                            journals of England and France. A weekly letter on American affairs is
                            also published in the St. Petersburg Journal, purporting to come from
                            New York, but doubtless made up in London, while on the arrival of every
                            steamer from the United States the same journal receives by telegraph
                            its most important items of news. Yesterday, for example, we had news
                            from New York to December 28. Although the intelligence thus far, in
                            reference to the preservation of the Union, has been uniformly bad, I
                            think the general belief here is still favorable to some amicable
                            adjustment. European statesmen have seen so many violent agitations
                            spring up and subside in our country, that they expect to see this one
                            take the same course. They cannot understand, moreover, how a great
                            government like ours, whose career has been eminently prosperous, can be
                            suddenly destroyed without any apparent cause, by the very people who
                            are themselves a part of it, and who are daily receiving its benefits.
                            They have never seen an American citizen abroad who did not glory in the
                            American name, and boast, with honest pride, of our popular
                            institutions. They have never seen an American journal either where this
                            same spirit was not manifested of satisfaction with the American
                            Constitution, and of attachment to the American form of government.
                            Under this government they have seen our country advance in population,
                            and territory, and wealth, and honor, as no nation on earth was ever
                            before permitted to do, and this progress, instead of exhausting its
                            energies, has seemed to them to inspire it with new vigor for its future
                            growth. They have regarded it, also, as one of the striking
                            peculiarities of our republic, that while its national developments and
                            national glory have been thus marvellously grand, they represent, at the
                            same time, an amount of individual advancement and personal happiness
                            which can be found nowhere else beneath the sun. They cannot persuade
                            themselves that a government thus idolized apparently by its citizens,
                            under which these great results have been already worked out, and under
                            which still greater results may fairly be anticipated, is really about
                            to be destroyed in the midst of its usefulness and by the hands of its
                            own people. Still less can they comprehend the method of peaceable
                            secession <pb n="298" xml:id="pg_298" facs="0298"/> by which this
                            destruction is sought to be accomplished. They have no idea of a
                            government which exists only at the will of a small minority of its
                            citizens, or of a revolution in which weakness is permitted to triumph
                            over greatly superior strength. They have no sympathy with the idea of
                            State secession any more than with the system of negro slavery, and they
                            will be slow, therefore, to give back their old confidence in the United
                            States, even if the present difficulties there should be happily
                            surmounted, unless, indeed, they can understand at the same time that
                            the right of secession, which is now so earnestly claimed, has been
                            substantially abandoned throughout the country, and is not likely to be
                            again insisted on in any practical form. If, however, the existing
                            difficulties shall not be surmounted, and under the influence of this
                            doctrine the Union shall be broken up, the result will be hailed
                            undoubtedly by the cabinets of Europe as a conclusive proof of the
                            instability of popular institutions; and the destruction of the American
                            government will be a calamity, therefore, not only to those who enjoy
                            its benefits at home, but to those oppressed people also in the Old
                            World, whose hearts are now cheered by the knowledge of its existence,
                            and whose eyes are turned daily towards it for support and consolation.
                            Yet those governments on this side of the Atlantic, who have looked to
                            our republic as the only maritime check in the world upon Great Britain,
                            will not be quite satisfied to see this counterpoise disappear, and that
                            haughty power restored to its old position of mistress of the seas.</p>
                        <p>The great events which are now in progress in the United States will
                            continue to be regarded, therefore, with the deepest interest throughout
                            Europe, until they shall have reached their end. In the meantime I
                            cannot describe to you the painful anxiety with which those Americans
                            who are abroad await now the arrival of every mail from home. Amidst the
                            wars and convulsions of Europe we have been accustomed to look towards
                            the great republic as the assured and constant abode of tranquillity and
                            happiness, and we have rejoiced always in the conviction that, by our
                            right of citizenship there, we possessed a title and an honor which,
                            making each American himself the equal of a king, could receive no added
                            dignity from any royal order or imperial decoration. We have all had the
                            happy consciousness, moreover, that when our duties abroad should be
                            closed we had a country to return to, where we should find safety for
                            our lives and property, and numerous avenues wide open to prosperity and
                            honor and happiness. To see all this crumbling away before our eyes—our
                            country breaking into pieces—our citizenship changing from a glory to a
                            shame—our hopes in the future clouded over with doubt—anarchy, possibly,
                            taking the place of good government—civil war substituted, perhaps, for
                            peace and harmony—and ruin threatened to every valuable interest which
                            man can cherish. The bare possibility, I say, of such results as these,
                            deeply painful as it must be to our fellow-citizens at home, who yet
                            have the consolation of being able to struggle step by step against
                            them, is even more painful to those of us who are abroad, and who hear
                            of events only at fixed intervals, without the preparation of their
                            gradual approach, and without any power whatever to prevent them. Let us
                            hope even yet that the God of our fathers will not permit their children
                            to be the instruments and the victims of so vast a calamity, but that
                            oil may yet be poured upon the heaving waters, and the ship of state may
                            yet outride the storm. I am one of those who have never believed that it
                            could be possible to dissolve the American Union. I thought it was
                            protected by too much plighted faith, by too many sacred associations in
                            the past, by too much admitted usefulness in the present, and by too
                            many thick coming glories in the future, ever to be seriously in danger
                            of destruction. If in this, however, I have been mistaken, and the earth
                            is really to <pb n="299" xml:id="pg_299" facs="0299"/> be shadowed now
                            by the great calamity, may God have mercy upon those misguided men by
                            whose folly and wickedness it will have been accomplished.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The despatch of the department No. 10 and
                            your circular of March 9th have been received, and I have had several
                            interviews with Prince Gortchacow on the subject of them. Although no
                            agent was here from the Confederate States, and none was immediately
                            expected, I still thought it only prudent that your views in reference
                            to these States should be known by the Russian government, in order that
                            it might be prepared for the question of recognition whenever it should
                            be presented. I, therefore, handed to Prince Gortchacow a copy of
                            President Lincoln’s inaugural address, and read to him, at the same
                            time, such portions of the despatches I have mentioned as seemed to me
                            most important, particularly calling his attention to those passages
                            which declare the unquestioned legality of the existing government, the
                            revolutionary nature ef the movement which had been made against it, and
                            the full confidence of the President that the harmony of the Union would
                            be soon restored. In support of these views I added such suggestions of
                            my own as I thought appropriate, and expressed the hope that our
                            government might receive from Russia, at this crisis, a renewed
                            manifestation of that friendly disposition which had always marked the
                            intercourse between the United States and that empire. Prince Gortchacow
                            replied that the question of recognizing the Confederate States was not
                            now before the Emperor, and for the present he did not think it would
                            be. I might assure you, he said, that his Majesty was not unmindful of
                            the friendly relations which had so long subsisted between the two
                            countries, and that he sincerely desired the harmony and prosperity of
                            the Union. It was the only commercial counterpoise in the world, he
                            added, to Great Britain, and Russia would do nothing, therefore, to
                            diminish its just power and influence. It was only frank, however, to
                            say, that while things continued as they were, the commerce between the
                            Confederate States and Russia would not be interrupted. There was no
                            blockade of southern ports, and any informality in the papers of ships
                            which cleared there would be overlooked. This, he said, was the course
                            determined on by England and France, and he understood it was pursued
                            also by our own government. I told him I had no specific instructions on
                            this point, and did not know what rule had been adopted concerning it by
                            other nations. It seemed to me, however, that American ships ought to
                            carry the American flag and be provided with American papers; and if
                            this was not done or, still more, if the American character was
                            repudiated, I hardly saw how they could be recognized as American ships.
                            He said there were some difficulties certainly in the way, but it was
                            better to overlook them, and to receive the ships for just what they
                            were, vessels belonging to the <pb n="300" xml:id="pg_300" facs="0300"/>
                            United States, but not provided, in consequence of existing troubles,
                            with the usual evidence of nationality. I said, they might deny that
                            they belonged to the United States.</p>
                        <p>He replied that this would not alter the fact. They came from ports in
                            the United States, and the separation of the Confederate States was not
                            yet recognized. The policy, he said, involved no recognition of
                            nationality, but was only a concession in aid of commerce. I replied
                            that my only interest was to prevent this recognition. We desired to be
                            permitted to work out the pending questions in the Union in our own way,
                            and, in our endeavors to restore its unity and harmony, we thought we
                            had a right to rely upon the friendly aid and co-operation of other
                            nations. He said no nation would witness the restoration with more
                            satisfaction than Russia.</p>
                        <p>This is the substance of our conversations, and I need hardly trouble you
                            with any comments. It is obvious that Russia does not expect to be
                            called upon to decide the question of recognition until this decision
                            has been made by England and France, and that she expects to find it
                            then of easy solution. In the meantime she expresses the hope, which I
                            am inclined to think she really entertains, that our difficulties may be
                            amicably adjusted and the Union restored to its old harmony and power.
                            In the commercial policy which she has adopted towards southern ports
                            she has evidently followed the example of Great Britain and France. I
                            ought to add that Prince Gortchacow read to me extracts from several
                            letters of Mr. Stoekl, the Russian minister at Washington, which
                            indicated that the representatives of the three powers there were quite
                            agreed upon this subject. Under these circumstances, after stating such
                            objections to the policy as occurred to me, I contented myself with the
                            assurance of Prince Gortchakow that it was not intended to involve any
                            recognition of nationality.</p>
                        <p>I shall take care to inform you promptly of any attempts which may be
                            made here “to embarrass or overthrow the republic,” and you may rely
                            also upon my best efforts to prevent and counteract them.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The circular of the department dated April
                            20, 1861, indorsing the President’s proclamation on the subject of
                            blockades and privateering, has been received. I have written to our
                            consuls at the different ports of Russia, calling their special
                            attention to the subject, and enjoining upon them the utmost vigilance
                            to prevent the fitting out of privateers within their respective
                            consulates. At Sebastopol, where we have no consul, I have written to

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: We have received Mr. Appleton’s despatch
                            of the 8th of April, (No. 16.) The manner in which Prince Gortchacow has
                            expressed himself on the subject of the domestic disturbances in our
                            country, and the anticipated application of the insurgents for a
                            recognition of their assumed authority, is in harmony with the friendly
                            spirit which Russia has always manifested towards the United States, and
                            in the main is quite satisfactory. We might, indeed, have felt ourselves
                            bound to except to the claim that while matters should remain as they
                            were assumed to be when this conversation was held, irregularities in
                            the observance of our revenue laws practiced by foreign nations would be
                            expected to be overlooked by this government; but that question has
                            passed by. We have put our land and naval forces in motion to suppress
                            the insurrection, and have closed the ports which have been seized by
                            the revolutionists by a blockade. You may, if occasion shall offer,
                            assure the Russian government that we expect that the unhappy
                            disturbance will not continue long, and that peace and harmony will
                            return, and the Union be stronger and firmer than ever before.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Appleton’s judicious and energetic conduct in this connexion is
                            approved and appreciated by the President.</p>

                            which have been recently issued for the guidance of its officers in
                            respect to the flags and ships of the Confederate States. It will be
                            seen that they conform to what was said to me on this subject by Prince
                            Gortchacow in the conversation which I reported to the department in my
                            No. 16. I ought to add that every American ship which has yet appeared
                            at Cronstadt has shown the American flag and claimed the American
                            character. In one case from a southern port the papers were not quite
                            regular, but the irregularity was overlooked.</p>

                            French; assured me of the continued feeling of friendship on the part of

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your despatch No. 3, dated June 7, was
                            duly received, and the intelligence of your safe arrival at your
                            destination afforded us much satisfaction.</p>
                        <p>So also the President is highly gratified with the liberal and friendly
                            sentiments concerning our domestic affairs, expressed to you by Prince
                            Gortchacow.</p>
                        <p>I transmit for your confidential perusal a copy of my last despatch to
                            Mr. Dayton, on the subject of our proposition to accede to the
                            declaration of the congress of Paris. The views it presents will be the
                            guide to your own action on that subject.</p>

                        <p>The Emperor returned from Moscow a few days ago, where, it is said, he
                            was engaged in suppressing the insurrections of the serfs. By persuasion
                            and arms, as the enemies of the liberation, the proprietors themselves,
                            or <pb n="304" xml:id="pg_304" facs="0304"/> their agents, were making
                            them believe that they were at once freed from all claims of work,
                            &amp;c., and this was done, no doubt, to prejudice the great work of the
                            Emperor. But it seems that everywhere the disaffection has been subdued,
                            and very strong demonstrations of respect have been, here and at Moscow,
                            by the peasants towards the Emperor, warmly exhibited.</p>
                        <p>On the 16th (28th) instant I called upon, by agreement, Prince Alexander
                            Gortchacow III, minister of foreign affairs to his Majesty the Emperor.
                            He received me in a cordial way, shaking hands, and causing me to be
                            seated. He led the conversation by saying the Emperor having been
                            advised of my arrival, had ordered him to express his continued
                            friendship for the United States government; that he had heard with
                            regret of our civil troubles, and hoped the Union a speedy triumph. I
                            responded that no change of administration had changed the relations of
                            the United States and Russia, whose natural position and traditionary
                            friendship must ever keep them in the closest harmony, and that I was
                            ordered by the President thus to express myself to his Imperial Majesty;
                            that I was ordered also to explain at the proper time the causes of our
                            difficulties at home; that at present I would only say that the rebel
                            slaveholders made war upon us because, following in the wake of
                            advancing civilization, we would not allow our government to be longer
                            the propagandist of slavery. I stated how the slave States were divided,
                            and my hope that the rebellion would be soon crushed out. To this he
                            attentively listened, and responded that he hoped it would be most “<hi
                                rend="italic">speedily</hi> done.”</p>
                        <p>Upon my giving him my office copy of the letter of credence, he said he
                            would see the Emperor, and let me know at my hotel when I would be
                            received by his Majesty. He also asked after Pickens, my family, and
                            other things in a familiar way, when I was dismissed by again shaking
                            hands. I have given the substance of the interview, and the words as
                            near as may be, in order that you may for yourself draw your own
                            conclusions. *</p>

                        <p>According to the rule here, I day before yesterday called upon M. de
                            Tchetestcheff, master of ceremonies. My visit was yesterday returned,
                            and I now await further orders from the Emperor as to the presentation,
                            of the which I will write you the particulars before sending you this. *

                        <p>Prince Gortchacow having returned my visit, gave me notice that the
                            Emperor would receive me on Sunday, at twelve o’clock, the 2d (14th)
                            July, at Peterhoff. So on to-day (14th July) I and my suite, Green Clay,
                            William G. Goodloe, and T. Williams, private secretaries, set out at ten
                            a. m. for Peterhoff by rail, the “geraut” of ceremonies meeting us at
                            the station here, and three of the Emperor’s carriages meeting us at the
                            depot and taking us to the palace. We then witnessed a review of cavalry
                            and infantry by the Emperor, and after it was over, at a little after
                            one o’clock, we were sent for by the Emperor, and, as my secretary was
                            told by the “master of ceremonies,” who is the regular introducer, I was
                            conducted into the presence by Prince Gortchacow, who, though the
                            Emperor spoke (English?) American mostly, acted as interpreter as to the
                            set speech, which was in Russian.</p>
                        <p>The Emperor received me standing, advancing and saying he was pleased to
                            see me. I then went through, very briefly, the usual forms of such
                            speeches, adding, that I ventured, by the orders of my government, to
                            say further to him that the President of the United States and the
                            American people looked with profound sympathy and admiration upon the
                            great reforms <pb n="305" xml:id="pg_305" facs="0305"/> which he was
                            attempting in his empire, which, without considering the philanthropic
                            view of the movement, by building up a middle class, be would add more
                            to the physical power of his country than did Peter the Great by
                            consolidation and extension; and that the success of his enterprise
                            would, in the estimation of the western nations, place him even above
                            that great ruler.</p>
                        <p>The Emperor seemed much gratified and really moved by this last remark,
                            which he saw was from us a real appreciation of his great undertaking,
                            and not an unmeaning compliment. He then said he would respond through
                            the prince; and, turning to him, he spoke with very decided earnestness.
                            In response to the first part of my address, he repeated the usual
                            words. To the last he said, in conclusion, that “so much the more had he
                            hopes of the perpetuity of the friendship between the two nations now,
                            that in addition to all former ties we were bound together by a common
                            sympathy in the common cause of emancipation.” I give nearly the exact
                            words. Among other things he expressed a very earnest wish that we would
                            speedily recover the integrity of the Union, The more formal speech was
                            done through the prince; the rest was spoken to me directly in English.
                            He asked me what late advices I had; and when I told him how many of the
                            border slave States were standing by the Union, he expressed great
                            satisfaction. He wanted to know if I thought England would interfere. I
                            told him we did not care what she did; that her interference would tend
                            to unite us the more; that we fought the south with reluctance; we were
                            much intermarried, and of a common history; but that the course of
                            England had aroused our sensibilities towards her in no very pleasant
                            manner. The Emperor seemed to like my seeming defiance of old “John
                            Bull” very much. He wanted to know if I was a relative of Henry Clay,
                            and what was my military rank. I told him I was only a distant relation
                            of Clay, and that I wore the uniform of an American colonel, which rank
                            I had filled in my own country. The Emperor then wished that our
                            personal relations would advance the national friendship, as our former
                            ministers had so succeeded; inquired after Mr. Appleton’s health;
                            regretted that he had not seen him before his departure; shook hands
                            with me; when I accompanied him into the ante-chamber, and introduced to
                            him my three attachés, to whom he made pleasant remarks, when, shaking
                            hands once more, he dismissed us.</p>

                        <p>I have already made this letter too long; but I cannot conclude without
                            saying how much more and more I value the great and inestimable
                            blessings of our government, and how I trust in God that no compromise
                            will be made of the great idea for which we have so long fought, but
                            that General Scott, following out the programme of Mr. Lincoln’s

                        <p>A few days since I laid before Prince Gortchacow the declaration of the
                            seven powers at Paris, April 16, 1856, as you had prepared it. He
                            expressed himself favorably inclined towards allowing us to become a
                            party, saying that Russia had, in a friendly spirit, in 1856, asked that
                            America and the parties not acceding should be exempt from its force;
                            for he desired to see the United States flourish as a naval power; * * *
                            that he would take the scheme under consideration, and advise me of the
                            Emperor’s conclusion. I laid before him also an additional clause,
                            embracing Secretary Marcy’s proposition: “Private goods of citizens or
                            subjects of neutrals, and of belligerents, at sea, not contraband of
                            war, shall not be liable to capture.” Of this also he spoke favorably,
                            but said, as we could not enforce it without the accession of the great
                            powers, it should be referred to them. I said that there must be a
                            beginning, and that I hoped the Emperor would both accept it and urge it
                            upon the maritime powers. Should this advance be made, (and why not?) it
                            would, most of all, benefit the United States; whilst, in agreeing
                            simply to the Paris declaration, we are most of all injured.</p>

                            exactly anticipated by me. I put the Paris declaration, “pure and
                            simple,” for immediate adoption, and reserved the Marcy addendum for
                            future consideration. No doubt it will be ultimately adopted; for all
                            the nations except France, England, and the United States, would no

                            been received. The account which it gives us of your reception by the
                            Emperor of Russia, and of the just purposes and friendly wishes
                            expressed by him in relation to the United States, is eminently
                            satisfactory. I sincerely hope that the good understanding which now
                            exists between the two governments may continue. I am sure you need no
                            new instructions to enable you to say that we rejoice in the peaceful
                            progress of the means which the Emperor has initiated for meliorating
                            the condition of the people of Russia.</p>
                        <p>Your suggestions concerning certain modern improvements of rifled cannon
                            have been commended to the consideration of the Secretary of War.</p>
                        <p>We wait with interest upon your negotiation on the subject of the rights
                            of neutrals in maritime war, which your despatch leads us to suppose you

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your despatch of the 3d of August (No. 5)
                            has been received.</p>
                        <p>I have been quite well aware that our relations to Great Britain and
                            France, in this crisis of our domestic difficulties, are attended by
                            complications and dangers which altogether surpass any that we can have
                            to encounter in our intercourse with Russia and other northern European
                            powers. We hope and expect to be always in relations of amity and real
                            friendship with those powers, and are very willing to negotiate with
                            them, and especially with Russia, upon the basis of the declaration of
                            the congress of Paris, either with or without the Marcy amendment,
                            though greatly preferring that that amendment shall be incorporated into
                            the treaty.</p>
                        <p>At the same time, it is well that you should know that thus far the
                            propositions for similar treaties with Great Britain and France have not
                            yet been acceded to by those governments. If the imperial government,
                            for any reason, prefer to delay acting upon the subject until the
                            decisive results of our negotiations with the two other powers named, we
                            shall not expect you to be urgent upon the subject. We simply desire to
                            act justly and candidly with all other nations, so as to give them all
                            reasonable guarantees for the security of commerce during the
                            continuance of our civil war. This done, we can cheerfully abide the
                            coming of events, never doubting for a moment the complete restoration
                            of the authority and high prestige of the federal Union.</p>
                        <p>Your remarks upon the subject of Mexico are very interesting, and they
                            will have due weight in forming any determination which the rapid course
                            of political events there shall require us to adopt.</p>
                        <p>I wish that it were compatible with my many cares at this critical moment
                            to impart to each of our ministers abroad a full knowledge of the
                            condition of <pb n="308" xml:id="pg_308" facs="0308"/> our negotiations
                            and discussions with all foreign powers. If I could do so, you would
                            probably be satisfied that you are laboring under apprehensions of some
                            imaginary foreign dangers. But such a proceeding is absolutely
                            impossible, and I must be content to advise you, when necessary, of the
                            President’s wishes in regard to your own mission, and leave you, as to
                            the rest, to await ultimate, and yet seasonable, developments.</p>
                        <p>I am, sir, respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: From the beginning of the conflict
                                which divides the United States of America you have been desired to
                                make known to the federal government the deep interest with which
                                our august master was observing the development of a crisis which
                                puts in question the prosperity and even the existence of the
                                Union.</p>
                            <p>The Emperor profoundly regrets to see that the hope of a peaceful
                                solution is not realized, and that American citizens, already in
                                arms against each other, are ready to let loose upon their country
                                the most formidable of the scourges of political society—a civil
                                war.</p>
                            <p>For the more than eighty years that it has existed the American Union
                                owes its independence, its towering rise, and its progress to the
                                concord of its members, consecrated, under the auspices of its
                                illustrious founder, by institutions which have been able to
                                reconcile union with liberty. This union has been fruitful. It has
                                exhibited to the world the spectacle of a prosperity without example
                                in the annals of history.</p>
                            <p>It would be deplorable that, after so conclusive an experience, the
                                United States should be hurried into a breach of the solemn compact
                                which, up to this time, has made their power.</p>
                            <p>In spite of the diversity of their constitutions and of their
                                interests, and perhaps, even, <hi rend="italic">because</hi> of this
                                diversity, Providence seems to urge them to draw closer the
                                traditional bond which is the basis and the very condition of their
                                political existence. In any event, the sacrifices which they might
                                impose upon themselves to maintain it are beyond comparison with
                                those which dissolution would bring after it. United, they perfect
                                themselves; isolated, they are paralyzed.</p>
                            <p>The struggle which unhappily has just arisen can neither be
                                indefinitely prolonged nor lead to the total destruction of one of
                                the parties. Sooner or later it will be necessary to come to some
                                settlement, whatsoever it may be, which may cause the divergent
                                interests now actually in conflict to coexist.</p>
                            <p>The American nation would then give a proof of high political wisdom
                                in seeking in common such a settlement before a useless effusion of
                                blood, a barren squandering of strength and of public riches, and
                                acts of violence and reciprocal reprisals shall have come to deepen
                                an abyss between the two parties to the confederation, to end
                                definitively in their mutual exhaustion, and in the ruin, perhaps
                                irreparable, of their commercial and political power.</p>
                            <p>Our august master cannot resign himself to admit such deplorable
                                anticipations. His Imperial Majesty still places his confidence in
                                that practical <pb n="309" xml:id="pg_309" facs="0309"/> good sense
                                of the citizens of the Union who appreciate so judiciously their
                                true interests. His Majesty is happy to believe that the members of
                                the federal government and the influential men of the two parties
                                will seize ail occasions and will unite all their efforts to calm
                                the effervescence of the passions. There are no interests so
                                divergent that it may not be possible to reconcile them by laboring
                                to that end with zeal and perseverance in a spirit of justice and
                                moderation.</p>
                            <p>If, within the limits of your friendly relations, your language and
                                your councils may contribute to this result, you will respond, sir,
                                to the intentions of his Majesty the Emperor in devoting to this the
                                personal influence which you may have been able to acquire during
                                your long residence at Washington, and the consideration which
                                belongs to your character as the representative of a sovereign
                                animated by the most friendly sentiments towards the American Union.
                                This Union is not simply, in our eyes, an element essential to the
                                universal <hi rend="italic">political</hi> equilibrium. It
                                constitutes, besides, a nation to which our august master and all
                                Russia have pledged the most friendly interest; for the two
                                countries, placed at the extremities of the two worlds, both in the
                                ascending period of their development, appear called to a natural
                                community of interests and of sympathies, of which they have already
                                given mutual proofs to each other.</p>
                            <p>I do not wish here to approach any of the questions which divide the
                                United States. We are not called upon to express ourselves in this
                                contest. The preceding considerations have no other object than to
                                attest the lively solicitude of the Emperor in presence of the
                                dangers which menace the American Union, and the sincere wishes
                                which his Majesty entertains for the maintenance of that great work,
                                so laboriously raised, which appeared so rich in its future.</p>
                            <p>It is in this sense, sir, that I desire you to express yourself, as
                                well to the members of the general government as to influential
                                persons whom you may meet, giving them the assurance that in every
                                event the American nation may count upon the most cordial sympathy
                                on the part of our august master during the important crisis which
                                it is passing through at present.</p>
                            <p>Receive, sir, the expression of my very distinguished
                                consideration.</p>

                            the subject of the internal differences which for a time have seemed to
                            threaten the American Union, as they are communicated in the instruction
                            from Prince Gortchacow, and by him read, by his Majesty’s direction, to
                            the President of the United States and Secretary of State. Mr. De
                            Stoeckl will express to his government the satisfaction with which the
                            President regards this new guarantee of a friendship between the two
                            countries, which had its beginning with the national existence of the

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The one subject in all our foreign
                            relations which most anxiously engages the President’s attention is the
                            possible action of other nations in regard to the domestic controversy
                            which is raging within our own borders.</p>
                        <p>Parties long ago found it their apparent interest to appeal to local
                            interests and prejudices, and they have persevered in that policy so far
                            and with such effect that masses large enough to control the action of
                            the State authorities have at last come to prefer disorganization and
                            disunion, rather than to acquiesce in the will of the majority expressed
                            in conformity with the provisions of the organic law.</p>
                        <p>To a well-balanced mind it seems very strange that a citizen, ever
                            without the excuse of intolerable oppression, passes the first stage of
                            sedition, for it is at that very stage that the malcontent finds himself
                            obliged to seek aid from aliens to defeat the equal laws and overthrow
                            the beneficent institutions of his own country. Sedition in the United
                            States is not merely unreasonable, it is altogether absurd. Human
                            ingenuity has never yet devised, nor can it devise, a form of government
                            in which the individual citizen can retain so large a portion of the
                            natural rights of man, and at the same time receive so ample a
                            protection against the dangers which so often threaten the safety and
                            even the existence of nations. Nevertheless, an insurrection has broken
                            out here; a pretended government has been constituted under the name of
                            the Confederate States of America, and that government now has its
                            agents abroad seeking to obtain a recognition of its sovereignty and
                            independence.</p>
                        <p>It is hardly to be supposed that these agents will visit the capital of
                            Denmark. They will seek the favor of powers supposed to be more
                            capricious or more ambitious. Nevertheless political action even of the
                            more commanding or more active States is influenced by a general opinion
                            that is formed imperceptibly in all parts of the Eastern continent.
                            Every representative of the United States in Europe has, therefore, a
                            responsibility to see that no effort on his part is wanting to make that
                            opinion just, so far as the true position of affairs in his own country
                            is concerned.</p>
                        <p>It cannot be necessary to discuss at large the merits of the unhappy
                            controversy. It is sufficient to speak of its nature and its probable
                            result. The insurrection strikes at the heart of the nation. The
                            country, so long accustomed to profound tranquillity and universal
                            loyalty, was slow to believe that a parricidal purpose could be
                            contemplated where it felt satisfied there was no just cause for serious
                            discontent. Our government is at once a purely representative and simply
                            federal one.</p>
                        <p>While the insurrection was gathering, the administration was practically
                            paralyzed by the presence, in a very large proportion, of the plotters
                            and abettors of the movement, in what, in Europe, would be called the
                            ministry, in the legislative, in the army, in the navy, in the customs,
                            in the post office, in the diplomatic and consular representations
                            abroad.</p>
                        <pb n="312" xml:id="pg_312" facs="0312"/>
                        <p>Seventy years of almost unbroken peace had brought agriculture, mining,
                            manufactures, and trade to the highest possible state of activity, and
                            the people shrunk intuitively from a change of that peaceful activity,
                            for not merely war, but needless and ruinous civil war, which even
                            threatens to take on the revolting character of servile war.</p>
                        <p>The insurgents skilfully availed themselves of these doubts and fears,
                            and by a course of affected moderation increased them. It seemed as if
                            the nation would fall into ruins without even putting forth an effort to
                            preserve its integrity. You could not, therefore, have been surprised at
                            finding on your arrival in Europe that the same impression had obtained
                            there, and that the Union of these States was assumed, in European
                            circles, to be practically at an end. For a time loyal citizens occupied
                            themselves with trying how, by compromise, to avert a civil war, rather
                            than to accept as inevitable an event so unnatural and so fearful.</p>
                        <p>The crisis, however, came at last, a few days after your departure from
                            the country. The insurgents, with the force gathered through immense
                            preparations around a fortress in their own locality, opened a terrible
                            fire upon it, to prevent the handful of men, which constituted the
                            garrison, from receiving supplies when on the verge of famine, and
                            continued the cannonade, though the barracks were in flames, and the
                            brave men, thus imperilled, were obliged to abandon defence against
                            assault to save themselves from destruction in another form. The
                            defending force consented to a capitulation dishonorable only to their
                            assailants.</p>
                        <p>This last and most violent pressure reached at once the very centre where
                            the elastic force of the national spirit lay concealed. The government
                            accepted the issue of civil war, and sent forth its appeal to the
                            patriotism of the people. Never in any age or country was such an appeal
                            responded to with so much promptness, enthusiasm, and resolution; and
                            certainly never did any nation disclose and offer up at once such
                            exhaustless resources for its self-preservation.</p>
                        <p>The revolution already is upon the recoil. Its failure is certain. All
                            that remains is to see what shall be the measure of the disasters and
                            calamities, affecting chiefly the insurgents themselves, which are to be
                            endured before they consent to a restoration of peace, and to guarantee
                            the inviolability of the Union.</p>
                        <p>Friendly nations may for a little time, perhaps, suffer some
                            inconvenience from the blockade of the ports of the insurgent States,
                            which this government has found it necessary to set on foot, as they
                            will justly take alarm at the announcement that the revolutionary party
                            have proclaimed their purpose to employ privateers to prey upon the
                            commerce of the country. But the embarrassments attending the first
                            measure will be mitigated by the strictness and efficiency with which it
                            will be enforced, and it will not be maintained a day longer than is
                            necessary. Our naval arm is already strong, and it will promptly be made
                            stronger, so that the other evil will be, as we trust, effectually
                            prevented. * * * * *</p>

                            of the 24th ultimo, which has been addressed to the several ministers of
                            the United States accredited to the maritime powers whose
                            plenipotentiaries composed the congress at Paris of the 16th of April,
                            1856, calling their attention to the importance of endeavoring to
                            negotiate with those powers conventions upon the subject of the rights
                            of belligerents and neutrals in time of war. The government of Denmark
                            was not represented in the Paris congress; but the negotiation of a
                            similar convention with that government is considered desirable, and you
                            will therefore be governed by the instruction of which I enclose a
                            transcript, and endeavor to effect that object. With this view I
                            herewith send you a full power and a draft of the proposed
                            convention.</p>

                            himself decidedly in favor of the administration and against the
                            so-called confederates. He also informed me that the King would not

                            been received.</p>
                        <p>The affair of the place of deposit for papers of Danish vessels, to which
                            you direct my attention, has been already settled in a manner which
                            will, I am sure, be entirely satisfactory to the government of
                            Denmark.</p>

                            reverse of our arms at Bull Run, and the unfavorable comments on our
                            course which this misfortune elicits in Europe. There is, however, no
                            occasion for apprehension of an unfavorable issue of the present civil
                            contest.</p>
                        <p>Whatever speculations on the subject may be made at home or abroad, you
                            may be assured that it is not in our day that treason is to prevail
                            against the government in our country, based as it is on the rights of
                            man and his capacity for self-government.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I know that you will be welcome at Turin.
                            Count Cavour, a true exponent of the sentiments of a generous sovereign,
                            will be rejoiced to receive from this country a minister who will not
                            manifest repugnance to the aspirations of the Italian people for liberty
                            and unity. The government of the United States practices
                            non-intervention in all other countries and in the controversies between
                            them. You are at liberty, however, and, indeed, are especially charged,
                            to assure his Majesty that he is held in high consideration by the
                            President and the people of the United States. You will further assure
                            him that it is a source of sincere satisfaction to this government that
                            Italy seems to be even more prosperous and happy now under his
                            government, although enjoying only short respites from revolutionary
                            struggles for independence, than it has been at many periods long gone
                            by, when despotism shielded that classic region from turbulence and
                            civil commotion.</p>
                        <p>You will learn from observation that government, even when its counsels
                            are inspired by patriotism and humanity, has its trials and
                            embarrassments as well in Italy as elsewhere. How to save the country
                            from the ambitious designs of dangerous neighbors on either hand—how to
                            reconcile the national passion for freedom with the profound national
                            veneration for ecclesiastical authority—how to harmonize the lassitude
                            of society in the Mediterranean provinces with the vigor that prevails
                            along the Appenines, and how to conduct affairs with so much moderation
                            as to win the confidence of the conservative interests, and yet not to
                            lose the necessary support of the propagandists of freedom, are tasks
                            witnessed there which will convince the American statesman that even in
                            that country the establishment and maintenance of free government are
                            attended with difficulties as formidable as those which sometimes
                            produce political despondency in our own.</p>
                        <p rend="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
                        <p rend="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
                        <p>Since the inauguration of the President it has been my duty to prepare,
                            under his directions, instructions to many of our ministers going
                            abroad. The burden of them all has been, not the ordinary incidents of
                            international hospitality and commerce, which reduce diplomacy to a
                            monotonous routine, but the extraordinary and sometimes alarming
                            condition of our own internal affairs, threatened with the complication,
                            most of all to be deprecated, of intervention, in some form or other, by
                            European nations.</p>
                        <p>This foreign danger arose chiefly out of the deplorable condition of
                            affairs at home. The administration found the government disorganized by
                            the presence of disunionists of high position and authority in all its
                            departments. Some time was necessary to eliminate them before any
                            decisive <pb n="318" xml:id="pg_318" facs="0318"/> policy could be
                            adopted. It was, moreover, necessary to forbear from demonstrations of
                            federal authority that might be represented as aggressive, to allow the
                            revolution to reveal its alarming proportions and boldly proclaim its
                            desperate and destructive designs.</p>
                        <p>It was seen all the time that these needful delays were liable to be
                            misunderstood abroad, and that the malcontents would endeavor to take
                            advantage of them there. The government has, therefore, not been
                            surprised, although it has been deeply grieved, to see the agents of the
                            revolutionary party, perhaps even with the concurrence of some of our
                            own demoralized ministers in Europe, insidiously seeking to obtain from
                            some of its sovereigns a recognition of the projected treasonable
                            confederacy.</p>
                        <p>It has been no easy task to study the sophisms, arts, and appliances
                            which they might be expected to use in the highly commercial circles of
                            Belgium, Paris, and London. It was nevertheless necessary to attempt it,
                            for human nature is at least no more moral, just, or virtuous in courts
                            than it is in private life. There is no such embarrassment, however, in
                            the present case. It often happens that foreign observers, if candid,
                            understand American questions quite as well as Americans themselves.
                            Botta and De Tocqueville were of this class.</p>
                        <p>So Count Cavour cannot be at any loss to understand the present political
                            condition of the United States.</p>
                        <p>The American revolution of 1776, with its benignant results, was due to
                            the happy combination of three effective political ideas: First, that of
                            emancipation from the distant European control of Great Britain; second,
                            popular desire for an enlargement of the political rights of the
                            individual members of the State upon the acknowledged theory of the
                            natural rights of man; third, the want of union among the States to
                            secure safety, tranquillity, aggrandizement, and fame.</p>
                        <p>The revolution attempted in 1861 is a spasmodic reaction against the
                            revolution of 1776. It combines the three ideas which were put down, but
                            not extinguished, in that great war, namely: First, European authority
                            to regulate political affairs on this continent; second, the
                            aggrandizement and extension of human slavery; third, disunion,
                            dissolution, anarchy.</p>
                        <p>Any impartial thinker can see that an attempt at a revolution so
                            unnatural and perverse as this could never have been embraced by any
                            portion of the American people, except in a moment of frenzied partisan
                            disappointment; that it has no one element of success at home, and that
                            it is even more portentous to all other governments than to our own. It
                            is painful to see faction stalking abroad in one’s native land. But
                            faction is incident to every state, because it is inherent in human
                            nature. We prefer, if it must come, that it come in just its present
                            form and character. It will perish by simply coming to confront the
                            American people, for the first time brought to meet that enemy of
                            national peace and safety in arms. The people are aroused, awakened,
                            resolute, and determined. The danger is, therefore, already passed. We
                            no longer fear—indeed, we hardly deprecate—the disaster of civil war
                            brought upon us without fault. We now see that it may be regarded as a
                            necessary trial to preserve the perfection of our Constitution, and to
                            remove all remaining distrust of its durability and its adaptation to
                            the universal wants of mankind.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Since my communication of the 16th of
                            April last, to announce my arrival here the 12th of that month, from my
                            late post, Rio de Janeiro, and of my having entered upon the discharge
                            of my duties as <hi rend="italic">chargé d’affaires ad interim</hi>, the
                            event first in order of importance, though not of time, which it is my
                            painful duty to communicate, is the sudden death, on the 6th instant, of
                            his excellency the Count Camillo Benso de Cavour, late president of his
                            Majesty’s council and minister of foreign affairs. The count was taken
                            ill on the evening of the 29th of May last at his residence, the hotel
                            of his elder brother, the Marquis de Cavour, of what proved to be typhus
                            fever. Injudicious and repeated bleedings at the commencement of the
                            fever, though, I am told, at his own instance, hastened the sad
                            event.</p>
                        <p>The count was never married.</p>
                        <p>Europe still echoes with eulogies to his memory. Among the most
                            felicitous and important, as expressing at the same time a political
                            programme, is a leading article in the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Constitutionnel</hi> of Paris, semi-official, and supposed to
                            emanate from the Emperor of the French. I extract a single sentence:
                            “S’il y a aujourd’ lui dans la péninsule un grand homme de moins il y a,
                            grâce à Dieu, un grand peuple de plus. <hi rend="italic">Et ce peuple
                                affranchi ne saurait desormais retomber dans la servitude</hi>.” In
                            common with my colleagues, of the diplomatic corps, I attended the
                            funeral obsequies in the parish church of the Madonna degli Angeli the
                            evening of the 7th instant, and the following morning the remains were
                            transferred to the burial vault of the Cavour family, at Santena, some
                            six miles distant from Turin, there to remain—thus contradicting the
                            reports of the public prints that, in compliance with the King’s wish,
                            they were to be entombed in the royal basilica of the Superga.</p>
                        <p rend="center">“Exegi monumentum ære perennius,<lb/>Regalique situ

                        <p>Shortly after my arrival, in consequence of the warlike disturbances at
                            home, the applications, written and verbal, by disbanded officers and
                            men of the late Garibaldian army of Southern Italy, for enlistment into
                            the United States army, became so numerous that I would call attention
                            to a card, of which I annex a copy, published at my request by his
                            Majesty’s government in the official paper.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The interruption of business in the
                            foreign office of this government, occasioned by the illness and death
                            of Count Cavour and a week’s absence of the King, which immediately
                            followed the formation of the new ministry, prevented me from obtaining
                            an audience of his Majesty for the purpose of delivering my letters of
                            credence until Sunday, the 23d day of this month.</p>
                        <p>On that day I was received by the King, and, in accordance with my
                            instructions, conveyed to him assurances of the high consideration in
                            which he is held by the President and people of the United States, and
                            of their satisfaction in observing the apparent prosperity and happiness
                            of Italy under his Majesty’s government. I further expressed the
                            personal gratification <pb n="321" xml:id="pg_321" facs="0321"/> I had
                            derived from being selected to represent the United States near the
                            government of the Italian people—a people which I had long known, and
                            which had always inspired me with deep interest—and especially from the
                            honor of being the first diplomate accredited to the first King of
                            Italy.</p>
                        <p>His Majesty received these remarks very graciously, using some terms
                            personally complimentary to me, testified much respect for the President
                            and for yourself, and expressed a strong interest in the welfare and
                            prosperity of the United States, as well as much solicitude for an
                            honorable termination of the present contest between the government and
                            the seceding States.</p>
                        <p>The audience was strictly private, no person but his Majesty and myself
                            being present, and the interview was therefore of a less formal
                            character than is usual with royal receptions. It is, perhaps, proper to
                            add that the communication was conducted in French, which is the usual
                            language of oral intercourse between foreign ministers and the sovereign
                            or the heads of departments at this court.</p>
                        <p>With Baron Ricasoli, the new head of the ministry and minister of foreign
                            affairs, I have had several interviews, as well before as since my
                            reception by the King, and I therefore am not aware that the public
                            interests have sustained any detriment by the delay of my official
                            reception. In all these interviews American politics have formed a
                            leading topic of conversation, and, though Baron Ricasoli speaks with
                            proper caution, the tenor of his remarks leaves no room for doubt that
                            his personal sympathies, as well as those of his government, are
                            entirely on the side of the President and the constituted authorities of
                            the Union in their great struggle.</p>
                        <p>The first point which I brought to the notice of the minister of foreign
                            affairs was the prevention of movements hostile to the United States in
                            the territories of the King of Italy. I stated that I had been led to
                            fear that some attempts were making at Genoa to fit out vessels or
                            purchase arms for the service of the rebels, and begged that the
                            attention of the local authorities at Genoa might be drawn to the
                            subject. Baron Ricasoli replied that the government would not knowingly
                            permit any such purchases to be made and that he would request the
                            minister of the interior to direct that the police of Genoa should be
                            watchful to detect and prevent any negotiations for that purpose.</p>
                        <p>The suggestions I made to Baron Ricasoli on this subject were founded
                            partly on a letter from Mr. H. S. Sanford and partly on vague rumors
                            circulating here, which I have been unable to trace to any certain
                            foundation, though I have made inquiry in all quarters known to me which
                            seemed to be probable sources of information. In the course of the last
                            week I employed an Italian gentleman, then about to proceed to Genoa,
                            and whom I believe to be entirely trustworthy, to investigate the
                            subject on the spot. He is still absent, and as he has not written to me
                            since arrivng at Genoa I infer that he has made no discoveries.</p>
                        <p>I have communicated to Baron Ricasoli the substance of my instructions
                            with regard to the proposed convention for the suppression of
                            privateering and the exemption of private property from capture by
                            national ships of war in certain cases. He replied that the Italian
                            government had not yet become a party to the convention of 1856, and
                            added that the pressure of business on his department would prevent his
                            giving immediate attention to the subject; but he expressed no objection
                            to a negotiation on the basis proposed in your instructions of the 24th
                            of April, 1861, or even on the broader ground of the total exemption of
                            all private property not contraband of war from capture at sea by ships
                            of war in all cases.</p>
                        <p>The Italian parliament is now in session, and will probably not adjourn
                            before the 15th or 20th of July. The cabinet ministers are members, as
                            in England, and regularly attend the sessions, which occupy a large part
                            of <pb n="322" xml:id="pg_322" facs="0322"/> the day. Many important
                            topics are under discussion in parliament, and still more weighty
                            questions of domestic and foreign policy are making large demands on the
                            time and absorbing the thoughts of the administration. It is, therefore,
                            not probable, as Baron Ricasoli intimated, that he will be able to
                            consider the subject of the convention until the adjournment of the
                            national legislature shall leave him more at leisure. In the meantime
                            the negotiations with the English and French governments on the same
                            subject will probably be brought to a close, and the final decision of
                            the Italian government will be much influenced by that of England and
                            France.</p>
                        <p>The death of Count Cavour, after an illness of a week’s duration, and
                            which, for the first few days, was not of a threatening character, was a
                            great shock to the friends of constitutional liberty and progress, and
                            an occasion of much ill-suppressed exultation among the advocates of
                            temporal and spiritual despotism throughout Europe, and especially in
                            Italy. To me, personally, it is a source of profound regret, both for
                            less selfish reasons and because I had special grounds for expecting,
                            more from his often expressed high regard for the President and yourself
                            than from any other cause, agreeable private and official relations with
                            this great statesman.</p>
                        <p>The successor of Count Cavour—and I may apply the same remark to most if
                            not all of the members of the cabinet—is a man of a high order of
                            talent, of great devotion to the interests of his country, of the same
                            general doctrines of national policy as his predecessor, and of sincere
                            attachment to the principles of civil and religious liberty. The
                            remarkable unanimity with which the new cabinet is sustained by the
                            parliament is a favorable omen, so far as respects the domestic success
                            of the government; and there is some reason to think that the death of a
                            prime minister, who was regarded with so much personal ill will by the
                            reactionary party in Italy and elsewhere in Europe, may tend to diminish
                            the asperity with which his policy has been hitherto opposed by that
                            party.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Having heard a report that Mr. Patterson,
                            consul of the United States at Genoa, expects a commission from the
                            Southern Confederacy to act as consul of the rebel States at that port,
                            I called on Baron Ricasoli yesterday morning, and protested against the
                            recognition of Mr. Patterson, or of any other person, as a consular
                            agent of the confederacy.</p>
                        <p>Baron Ricasoli assured me that, under present circumstances, at least, no
                            such agent would be recognized at any Italian port, and he took occasion
                            to repeat, in strong language, the expression of his own warm sympathy
                            with the federal government of the United States, and his earnest hope
                            that the present contest between the government and the seceding States
                            would end in the re-establishment of the lawful authority of the Union,
                            and be settled on terms which would secure the triumph of the principles
                            of freedom, and <pb n="323" xml:id="pg_323" facs="0323"/> the ultimate
                            extinction of human slavery. He added that, in these expressions he was
                            speaking the sentiments of his Majesty and of the entire government of
                            which he was a member.</p>
                        <p>I then referred to apprehensions which had been expressed in America of
                            the fitting out of privateers in remote Italian ports under the
                            confederate flag. He replied that the government officers would endeavor
                            to prevent such violations of the laws, but that it would be difficult
                            to exercise a vigilant supervision over all the remote and unfrequented
                            ports of the peninsula and islands, and he advised the appointment of
                            American consuls at points favorable for observation along the coasts,
                            as a good means of detecting and preventing such movements.</p>
                        <p>I had, on the same day, an audience of the Prince of Carignano, who
                            expressed opinions and feelings similar to those of Baron Ricasoli with
                            respect to our present national difficulties, and I may add that every
                            member of the government, and almost every gentleman in public life,
                            with whom I have conversed at Turin, coincides in these sentiments.</p>
                        <p rend="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
                        <p rend="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
                        <p>The favorable sentiments with which the present administration of the
                            federal government is regarded by most continental statesmen, are
                            founded (independently of the high personal regard felt for the
                            President and his constitutional advisers) partly on the opinion that it
                            is sustaining the cause of constitutional authority, of the entirety of
                            nationalities and of established order against causeless rebellion,
                            violent disruption of a commonwealth essentially a unit, and
                            disorganizing and lawless misrule; but still more, I think, on the
                            belief that the struggle in which it is now involved is virtually a
                            contest between the propagandists of domestic slavery and the advocates
                            of emancipation and universal freedom. If the civil war be protracted, I
                            am convinced that our hold upon the sympathy and good will of the
                            governments, and still more of the people of Europe, will depend upon
                            the distinctness with which this issue is kept before them, and if it
                            were now proposed by the federal government to purchase the submission
                            of the south by any concession to their demands on this subject, or by
                            assuming any attitude but that of, at least, moral hostility to slavery,
                            I have no doubt that the dissolution of the Union would be both desired
                            and promoted by a vast majority of those who now hope for its
                            perpetuation.</p>

                            The lesson that war cannot be waged successfully without wisdom as well
                            as patriotism has been received at a severe cost; but, perhaps, it was

                            effect, substantially in the form of a project for that purpose herewith
                            transmitted to you.”</p>
                        <p>The project transmitted with the instructions makes no mention of the
                            important conditions referred to in the instructions, and therefore, in
                            drawing up the note, I thought it best not to notice the conditions
                            specifically, but to make the proposal in general terms, leaving that
                            point to be arranged, if suggested by the Italian government, as I shall
                            be instructed hereafter.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, sir, with high respect, your obedient
                            servant,</p>

                            <p>The undersigned, envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of
                                the United States of America, as he had the honor to state in one of
                                his first interviews with his excellency the minister of foreign
                                affairs, is instructed to propose the negotiation of a convention
                                between the government of the United States and the government of
                                his Majesty the King of Italy for defining the rights of
                                belligerents and neutrals in maritime warfare, in accordance with
                                the principles adopted by the congress of Paris in the year
                                1856.</p>
                            <p>Similar instructions have been given by the President to the American
                                ministers at the courts of the other maritime powers, and
                                negotiations to that effect are now in progress with all the
                                governments represented at the congress of Paris.</p>
                            <p>It will be remembered by his excellency the minister of foreign
                                affairs that in the year 1854 the President of the United States
                                submitted to the several maritime nations two propositions, to which
                                he solicited their assent as permanent principles of international
                                law.</p>
                            <p>These were: <list>
                                    <label>1.</label>
                                    <item>Free ships make free goods—that is to say, that the
                                        effects or goods belonging to subjects or citizens of a
                                        power or state at war are free from capture or confiscation
                                        when found on board of neutral vessels, with the exception
                                        of articles contraband of war.</item>
                                    <label>2.</label>
                                    <item>That the property of neutrals on board an enemy’s vessel
                                        is not subject to confiscation, unless the same be
                                        contraband of war.</item>
                                </list></p>
                            <p>These propositions were favorably entertained by most of the
                                governments to which they were submitted, but no formal convention
                                for their recognition was negotiated between them and the United
                                States.</p>
                            <p>The congress of Paris, at which most of the European powers were
                                represented, adopted, upon the 16th of April, 1856, an agreement
                                embracing substantially these principles, with two additional
                                propositions; all of which were embodied in a declaration composed
                                of four articles, namely: <list>
                                    <label>1.</label>
                                    <item>Privateering is and remains abolished.</item>
                                    <label>2.</label>
                                    <item>The neutral flag covers enemy’s goods, with the exception
                                        of contraband of war.</item>
                                    <label>3.</label>
                                    <item>Neutral goods, with the exception of contraband of war,
                                        are not liable to capture under enemy’s flag.</item>
                                    <label>4.</label>
                                    <item>Blockades, in order to be binding, must be effective—that
                                        is to say, maintained by a force sufficient really to
                                        prevent access to the coast of the enemy.</item>
                                </list></p>
                            <p>The congress further agreed to invite the maritime states not
                                represented in that body to accede to these propositions, and the
                                assent of the government of the United States was asked to them
                                accordingly.</p>
                            <p>The then President of the United States, Franklin Pierce, did not
                                accede to the stipulations of the convention, but proposed an
                                amendment to the first article which should exempt the private
                                property of individuals, though belonging to belligerent states,
                                from seizure or confiscation by national vessels in maritime war;
                                and the ministers of the United States at Paris and London were
                                instructed to inform the governments to which they were accredited
                                that the United States would accede to the four points above
                                recited, provided the first of them should be amended to the effect
                                proposed by the President.</p>
                            <pb n="326" xml:id="pg_326" facs="0326"/>
                            <p>Neither of these governments is understood to have objected to this
                                amendment, but the negotiations were not prosecuted to a
                                conclusion.</p>
                            <p>The President of the United States adheres to the opinion expressed
                                by his predecessor, that it would be eminently desirable for the
                                good of all nations that the property and effects of private
                                individuals, not contraband, should be exempt from seizure and
                                confiscation by national vessels in maritime war. But the proposal
                                to that effect not having been accepted by the nations represented
                                in the congress of 1856, he now offers to accede to the invitation
                                of the powers, and to accept the declaration promulgated by it,
                                deferring to a future occasion the further prosecution of
                                negotiations for the general adoption of the amendment above
                                specified.</p>
                            <p>The undersigned is invested with full powers to conclude, on the part
                                of the President, a convention between the government of the United
                                States and that of his Majesty the King of Italy for the adoption of
                                the declaration of the congress of Paris, and begs leave to invite
                                the attention of his excellency the minister of foreign affairs to
                                the proposal.</p>
                            <p>The undersigned avails himself of this occasion to renew to his
                                excellency the minister of foreign affairs the assurance of his most
                                distinguished consideration.</p>

                        <p>I send you, in confidence, a copy of my latest instructions to Mr. Adams
                            and Mr. Dayton, from which you will learn that the negotiations with
                            Great Britain and France for an accession to the declaration of the
                            congress at Paris have been suspended, and the causes of the
                            suspension.</p>
                        <p>We are desirous to act in good faith, and to acquit ourselves of all
                            responsibility for the failure of negotiations with enlightened powers
                            for the advancement of the interests of peace and humanity; and yet we
                            are at the same time resolved to maintain the independent position and
                            the dignity of our government. We therefore hold ourselves ready to
                            perfect a convention with the government of Italy for our accession; and
                            at the same time you will not urge the proposition against any
                            disinclination which that government may express or intimate.</p>

                        <p>I think that when at no distant day it shall need to be renewed, the
                            interest that shall move it forward will appear first on the other side
                            of the Atlantic.</p>
                        <p>It is a matter of regret that we cannot consistently offer special
                            inducements to military gentlemen in Italy who are unable to defray
                            their own expenses in coming to join our armies; but we are forbidden to
                            do so by urgent considerations. First, we do not need to solicit foreign
                            aid, and we naturally desire to avoid the appearance of doing so.
                            Secondly, we wish to abstain from intrusion into the domestic concerns
                            of foreign states, and, of course, from seeming to do so. Thirdly, our
                            own countrymen are coming forward with just claims upon all positions
                            requiring skill in the art of war, and we must avoid jealousies between
                            native and foreign defenders of the Union. Already the forces in the
                            field exceed half a million, and the officers charged with organizing
                            them report to us that those recently recruited will swell the number to
                            seven hundred thousand. If the insurrection should continue, it will be
                            more difficult to keep them down to a million than to lift them up to
                            that figure. Still, we do not yet revoke what we have thus far said, and
                            we will receive from Europe those who may come.</p>
                        <p>A consul will be appointed for Ancona.</p>
                        <p>I am, sir, your obedient servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have delayed giving you the President’s
                            instructions so long because I was preoccupied. For the first time in
                            our history the standard of civil war has been raised with the purpose
                            of overthrowing the federal republic. It is a cardinal point with the
                            seditious in modern revolutions to gain aid, or at least sympathy, in
                            foreign countries. That sympathy is sought in the form of recognition of
                            the simulated sovereignty set up by faction. An act of recognition
                            carries moral weight, and material aid is expected soon to follow it. No
                            state ought to lend its support to revolution in a foreign country
                            except upon motives of justice and humanity. But in point of fact these
                            motives seldom prevail, and nations generally act in such cases upon
                            calculations of profit or ambition, or in the wantonness of mere
                            caprice. It is well understood here that the revolutionary faction has
                            its agents abroad, soliciting European powers to intervene in this
                            unhappy civil war. It has therefore been my duty, under the President’s
                            authority, to instruct our representatives there how to meet them and
                            counteract their designs. I could easily imagine that either Great
                            Britain, France, Russia, Austria, Prussia, Belgium, Spain, or even
                            Denmark, might suppose that it could acquire some advantage, or at least
                            some satisfaction to itself, from a change that should abridge the
                            dominion, the commerce, the prosperity, or influence of the United
                            States. Each of them might be believed to have envious sentiments
                            towards us, which would delight in an opportunity to do us harm. I have
                            therefore first addressed myself to the consideration or our relations
                            with those countries. It is otherwise with Italy and Switzerland. The
                            former is yet hotly engaged in the struggle to secure freedom and unity,
                            and the latter enviably distinguished by the rare enjoyment of both.
                            Human nature must lose not only the faculty of reason which lifts it
                            above the inferior beings, but also the benevolence which lifts it up to
                            commune with superior orders of existence, when the security, welfare,
                            and happiness of the United States shall have become even a matter of
                            indifference to Italy or Switzerland. I salute Switzerland last among
                            the European nations only because we esteem and confide in her most.</p>
                        <p>You will say this, or anything else that may occur to you that would more
                            pleasantly or more effectually assure the government of Switzerland of
                            the cordial good wishes cherished for it by the President and the people
                            of the United States.</p>
                        <p>You will, of course, need to say nothing to the government on the subject
                            of the domestic difficulties to which I have already adverted. You will,
                            nevertheless, not be absolutely free from all responsibility on this
                            head. You are in a region where men of inquiring mind and active habit
                            seek a temporary respite from severe studies and exhausting labors. The
                            world’s affairs are discussed freely, and the sentiments and opinions
                            which influence the conduct and affect the prospects of nations are very
                            often formed in the <pb n="330" xml:id="pg_330" facs="0330"/> mountains
                            and dells of Switzerland. You will meet there, if no others, many of our
                            own fellow-citizens, doubtlessly of both classes—the disloyal,
                            sometimes, as well as those who are loyal to the Constitution and the
                            Union. Improve the calmness and candor which the contemplation of nature
                            inspires to dissuade the discontented American from his unnatural course
                            and pernicious convictions, and to excite the loyal to return home as
                            speedily as possible to speak, to vote, and, if need be, to enrol
                            himself as a soldier or a sailor in the land or naval forces for the
                            defence of his country, of freedom, and of mankind.</p>
                        <p>Seventy years of tranquillity and harmony, unparalleled in the experience
                            of states, have made us misunderstand the stage in our national career
                            at which we have arrived. We had to prove, by demonstration in war, that
                            these institutions are adapted to defence against aggression, and even
                            for aggrandizement of empire. The proof was given, and the world has
                            nobly confessed the truth established.</p>
                        <p>We assumed that faction could not gain consistency and make head under
                            institutions so free, so equal, so just, and so beneficent. This was a
                            mistake less in regard to our institutions than in regard to human
                            nature itself. But self-complacent, and consequently self-deceived, we
                            have come all of a sudden to meet the emergency of civil war, and we
                            find ourselves obliged to demonstrate that our government is adapted to
                            resist and overcome domestic faction. It is a momentous but necessary
                            trial. Perhaps it has not come too soon. Certainly we have no
                            apprehension of failure. Revolutions are seldom successful, even when
                            they have just causes. Revolution without a good cause, amounting to
                            absolute necessity, is never possible in a country where stable
                            government is at all known by experience of its blessings. The present
                            attempt at revolution is based on no alleged experience of oppression.
                            It puts forth only apprehensions of danger of oppression, which the form
                            of the Constitution and the experience of its actual working proves to
                            be altogether impossible. It is a revolution originating only in
                            disappointed personal ambition. Personal ambition is the least effective
                            of all the political agencies that can be found in an extended federal
                            republic. The revolution aims at the life of the country. It gathers the
                            support of only that small, though very active, class of persons who are
                            so thoughtless as to be insensible to the importance of having a country
                            to protect and defend, with benefit to themselves and their posterity.
                            Against it are arrayed the larger portion of our people with whom love
                            of country is the first and strongest of all the social passions—that
                            holy sentiment which in mature life is the strongest passion of our
                            common humanity.</p>
                        <p>Tell the Swiss republic, then, that with God’s blessing we will preserve
                            this model of federal republican government by which they have reformed
                            their institutions, and we invoke them to retain their own with no less
                            fidelity. So Switzerland and the United States shall in after ages be
                            honored as the founders of the only true and beneficent system of human
                            government—a system that harmonizes needful authority with the
                            preservation of the natural rights of man. Every free citizen of
                            Switzerland who comes here, so long as he remains, is practically a
                            citizen of the United States. He goes in and out everywhere
                            unchallenged. Nevertheless, the American citizen in Switzerland is a
                            stranger, and the reiterated demand for his passport at every angle in
                            his course reminds him painfully that he is suspected. His least
                            elevated motive for going there is trade and commerce; but the objects
                            of most of our citizens in visiting Alpine countries are health and
                            study of the more sublime and attractive features of nature and a
                            fervent admiration for the free people who dwell among them. In the
                            United States there is not one man base enough to do or wish an injury
                            to the enlightened government or to the people of Switzerland. Why,
                            then, should not the government <pb n="331" xml:id="pg_331" facs="0331"

                        <p rend="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
                        <p>Referring to my No. 417, I communicated, in addition to the English
                            printed copy of the inaugural of the President, a carefully made German
                            translation. I have some reason to suppose that the commissioners of the
                            seceded States were, or would soon be, in Paris, and as Mr. Dudley Mann
                            was informally my predecessor in Berne, and has personal friends in the
                            governmental regions, and might profit by the occasion to slip over from
                            London or Paris, I had another interview on the subject this morning
                            with President Knüsel. A very severe illness had kept me some time from
                            seeing him. As I have received not a word from the department with
                            regard to my recall, I have not communicated officially with the
                            government upon the subject, but the President commenced, and I am
                            unwilling to repeat his friendly remarks. He alluded, however, to the
                            affair of Neuchâtel, and said I must not think the government had
                            forgotten the services I had rendered to Switzerland, and particularly
                            on that occasion. He repeated several times; but I will not dwell
                            further upon this point.</p>
                        <p>I asked if they had any news of the commissioners of the seceded States,
                            and said I thought they might perhaps pay Berne a visit. I then
                            addressed to him some earnest words upon a subject in which my whole
                            heart is interested. I told him my public and private intelligence
                            convinced me that the movement of the south would be suppressed; that it
                            was as insane as it was guilty; that the slowly rising spirit of the
                            north, and the calm and efficient preparations made by the President,
                            would, in due time, <pb n="332" xml:id="pg_332" facs="0332"/> bring it
                            to a termination; that the United States had always loved Switzerland,
                            but that I did not expect from him any sentimental engagements. I
                            wished, however, officially to express the opinion of my government,
                            and, privately, my own deep conviction, that the wise course of
                            Switzerland would be a flat refusal to receive, in any way, the
                            commissioners of the revolted States; that a different course would be
                            painfully remembered, while a prompt action in this direction would
                            surely draw much closer the bonds of friendship between the two
                            republics. I called his attention to the proclamation of the British
                            government, in which the seceded States are termed the “so-called
                            Confederate States.”</p>
                        <p>The President warmly acquiesced, and assured me that he completely shared
                            my opinion.</p>

                        <p>I had an earnest conversation with Mr. Frei Herosée on the subject of the
                            possibility of the reception of any southern agent. He is an old friend
                            of Mr. Dudley Mann. He is also one of the oldest and most influential
                            members of the federal council and founders of the government, and has
                            been several <pb n="333" xml:id="pg_333" facs="0333"/> times President.
                            He confirmed warmly all that President Knüsel had said, and in plainer
                            terms. Switzerland, he said, had always opposed rebellion and revolution
                            everywhere. He alluded, I presume, to the days of 1848, during which
                            this republic acted with equal liberality and wisdom. She has herself
                            passed through the same ordeal as that through which God is now leading
                            us, and she knows what it is for foreign powers to cast the weight of
                            their open encouragement or secret intrigue into the wrong scale.
                            Whatever importance may be attached to the course which Switzerland may
                            pursue on this point, I am almost positive no agent would be
                            received.</p>

                            whom I learn to regard as a friend, that I address to you this my
                            closing despatch.</p>
                        <p>I have placed him in possession of the legation office records, cipher,
                            library, furniture, and all things pertaining to it. An inventory has
                            been prepared, from the despatch books, of everything received; and he
                            will doubtless inform you that he has verified it.</p>
                        <p>Yesterday, July 1, he accompanied me to the <hi rend="italic">Palais
                                Fedéral</hi>, where we were received in the state reception-room by
                            the president and by the secretary of the federal chancery, Mr.
                            Leutscher. I handed in my letter of recall, and read, in German, the
                            remarks I had prepared. I then formally presented my successor, who gave
                            his <hi rend="italic">lettre de créance</hi>, and who requested me to
                            read a German translation of his remarks, which I did. The president
                            then replied to the latter. I have the honor to subjoin these documents
                            in English.</p>
                        <p>Some conversation then ensued of a friendly character. On leaving, the
                            president informed me he would make me a visit, and, taking me warmly by
                            the hand, he said, (alluding to Neuchâtel,) “we shall never forget what
                            you have done for us.” We then drove to all the legations, and I
                            presented the new minister to the <hi rend="italic">chefs de
                                mission</hi>, commencing with the French ambassador, the Marquis de
                            Turgot. It gives me pleasure to say Mr. Fogg obviously made a favorable
                            impression, and that it is a sincere satisfaction for me to see in my
                            place a gentleman who I have no doubt will represent with, dignity the
                            new country, which God is disengaging from elements irreconcilable with
                            its character as a Christian republic.</p>
                        <p>In my remarks to the president I thought it a proper occasion publicly to
                            record my opinion, that I might throw into the scale the influence,
                            however small, which I might possess from my long residence in
                            Europe.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the French and English declarations of neutrality, the
                            enclosed extract from the “New York Commercial Advertiser” emboldened me
                            to express the hope that those governments, whatever might have been <pb

                            <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">President</hi>. I have the honor to hand to
                                your excellency my letter of recall, and to present my estimable
                                successor, against whom I have only one objection—that he will, I am
                                afraid, perform the duties of his office better than I have done. I
                                am instructed by the President of the United States on this occasion
                                to repeat his sincere desire to continue to cultivate with you
                                relations of the closest friendship.</p>
                            <p>I resigned my appointment as minister in Switzerland, not that I had
                                any power or right to retain it contrary to the President’s wish,
                                but I thought it my duty, from certain considerations. This course
                                was not induced by any discontent with Switzerland. On the contrary,
                                I admire and love Switzerland. In my official transactions with the
                                government, and with the different members of it, I have always
                                found good sense and <hi rend="italic">loyauté</hi>, and my private
                                intercourse with the nation has caused it to rise always more in my
                                esteem. I have been struck with the pure administration of justice,
                                the universal love of country, the modest and yet effective
                                character of the governments, and with the liberty of conscience
                                asserted by superior authorities, even where embarrassed by local,
                                contrary influences. Switzerland is peculiarly blessed by the
                                Almighty, and she has it in her power, under Him, to be the happiest
                                country in the world. Your free development in your present form is
                                a necessity for Europe.</p>
                            <p>Neither has my resignation resulted from difference of opinion with
                                the President of the United States. Our country is now occupied in a
                                struggle with an institution as unmanageable as the hydra of
                                Hercules. It is not my wish to misrepresent the proprietors of
                                slaves. Many of them are sincere, Christian gentlemen. But the
                                institution in its present form is irreconcilable with our national
                                existence, with the religious sentiment of the majority, and with
                                the Word of God. Nothing can be clearer than the right and duty of
                                the American people to protect themselves from its uncontrolled
                                development, and from being drawn downwards in their career of
                                political and religious civilization. Man should not live by bread
                                alone, nor by cotton alone.</p>
                            <p>The election of President Lincoln is the expression of this
                                sentiment. The struggle in which he is engaged is one of light with
                                darkness. Every Christian government in the world must be on his
                                side, for he represents humanity, liberty, civilization, and
                                religion. He represents also the principle of rational, popular
                                government, and his course thus far has given reason to believe that
                                he has been raised up by God to steer our nation through this
                                tempest, by a union of moderation with energy, and of rapid decision
                                with patient mercy and calm wisdom, if no encouragement from without
                                be offered to the insurrection. No one who prefers good to evil
                                would place an obstacle in his path.</p>
                            <pb n="335" xml:id="pg_335" facs="0335"/>
                            <p>The movement of certain southern States—not to say persons—represents
                                not only rebellion against a Constitution and laws framed or freely
                                accepted by themselves, but negro slavery and the African slave
                                trade as one of its inevitable consequences. It represents also one
                                of the greatest crimes recorded in history—a black, secret,
                                long-matured, treacherous conspiracy, extending its ramifications
                                into European countries, which, among other objects, aimed at the
                                conquest of Cuba, Mexico, and Brazil, as the basis of a great,
                                despotic, and African slave-trade empire, and which, by the mercy of
                                God, must be shipwrecked against the steady firmness of the
                                President, the honesty, the patriotism, and the religious sentiment
                                of the American people. You will judge, Mr. President; also your
                                government and your people; Europe and history will also judge how
                                far any government, nation, or public press, can, consistently with
                                its character, approve or in any way encourage such an enterprise,
                                unless ignorant of its true nature. I have no doubt this
                                insurrection, although it has reached such proportions, will be
                                suppressed. We have the power, the right, and the will to suppress
                                it. It is not a war between two powers entitled to equal
                                international rights, any more than the rebellion in India was an
                                international war. It is an insurrection, and nothing more, and one
                                of the most unreasonable and unjust which the world has ever seen.
                                The American Union, carried out according to its original
                                intentions, offers to rapidly increasing millions material
                                prosperity, political and religious liberty. It is a blessing for
                                mankind; whereas the rise of a southern empire, built on such
                                foundations, and aiming at such designs, could not but be a
                                misfortune for itself and for all the world. It is one of the signs
                                of our times that error not only boldly raises its head, but that it
                                invites, with effrontery, the assistance of others, and sometimes
                                receives encouragement from quarters where it would least be
                                expected. I here in no way allude to the declarations of neutrality
                                lately proclaimed by two great powers, but to opinions expressed by
                                several journals. The declarations of neutrality have been
                                prematurely considered unfriendly acts by a portion of my
                                countrymen. They ought not to be so taken, unless applied in an
                                unfriendly manner; and I have no fear that either of these
                                enlightened and friendly governments would encourage the southern
                                movement by receiving its representatives or suffering its marine
                                prizes to be sold in their ports; and neither do I fear, Mr.
                                President, that the government of Switzerland, which has always on
                                such occasions proved itself wise and just, would ever throw its
                                weight into the scale of insane revolution, and of negro slavery
                                disengaged from all restraint, and of the African slave trade, by
                                receiving any representative of that portion of our States.</p>
                            <p>In concluding, Mr. President, I have the honor to bid you farewell,
                                and, in your person, to your estimable colleagues and to your free,
                                well-conducted, and happy country. May it never forget whence this
                                blessing comes, and what hand is indispensable for its continued
                                preservation! May your lakes and mountains—the admiration of the
                                world—ever represent, as they do now, peace, prosperity, prudence in
                                foreign policy, and, at home, Christian liberty!</p>

                                >President</persName></hi>.</head>
                            <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">President</hi>: The just and lucid statement
                                of the present condition and prospects of the United States made by
                                my honored predecessor and friend leaves for myself little more than
                                the agreeable duty of reaffirming what he has so well said.</p>
                            <p>There are crises in the lives of nations as well as of individuals.
                                Switzerland <pb n="336" xml:id="pg_336" facs="0336"/> has had her
                                crises. Times almost without number her brave mountaineers have been
                                called to arms to put down sedition at home and repel the invaders
                                from abroad. Thanks to the God of liberty, they have always
                                triumphed, and the land of Tell is still the home of the free.</p>
                            <p>The United States has had her crises. In her infancy, when Washington
                                led her brave sons to maintain her right to be one of the nations of
                                the earth, then was her crisis. Her second great, crisis is now,
                                when a despotic institution raises the standard of intestine war,
                                and appeals to foreign governments for sympathy and aid to break
                                down freedom and free institutions in America. This crisis, like
                                yours, shall be decided for liberty, and America, too, shall remain
                                the land of the free. The cloud which is now charged with
                                destruction will soon be dispersed, and be followed by the sunshine
                                of a purer and broader realization of the rights of mankind.</p>
                            <p>I am instructed to assure your excellency of the cordial good wishes
                                of the President of the United States, and of his desire to
                                cultivate and strengthen those relations of amity and sympathy which
                                have always subsisted and ought always to subsist between
                                governments whose political institutions are so nearly alike</p>
                            <p>In conclusion, let me say to your excellency and your associates that
                                it will be my highest ambition during my residence in your country
                                to so discharge all my duties that, while jealously guarding the
                                interests and rights of American citizens, I may deserve the
                                confidence and enjoy the personal friendship of all the members of
                                your government. Should I be as fortunate in these respects as my
                                predecessor has been, my highest hopes will be gratified.</p>
                            <p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">President Knuesel’s reply</hi>.</p>
                            <p>The Swiss confederation has always taken a lively interest in
                                everything concerning the great sister republic beyond the Atlantic.
                                How could it be otherwise? The similarity of the democratic
                                federative institutions, the independence and liberty which both
                                enjoy, and which they had to obtain by force of arms, has
                                necessarily led to a mutual approach, however great the distance be
                                which separates the old world from the new. In this may be found,
                                perhaps, a principal reason why for a long series of years numerous
                                Swiss families emigrated to the United States, where they sought and
                                found a new home, and why the names of Swiss cantons and towns are
                                now to be found where for thousands of years uncultivated and
                                unpopulated forests and prairies existed. The intercourse between
                                the two nations has since steadily increased; the produce of one
                                country finds its market in the other, and numerous points of
                                connexion develop themselves ever more and more.</p>
                            <p>This harmony of political principles, sympathies, and interests has
                                for its consequence a steadily increasing approach of both nations,
                                which has already on different occasions shown itself by marks of
                                mutual cordiality. Names like that of William Tell, so dear to
                                Switzerland, were given to sea vessels by citizens of the United
                                States. The federal council responded to that salutation by hoisting
                                the Swiss flag on the mainmast of those ships. To the colossal
                                monument which the United States erected in memory of their
                                liberator, the immortal Washington, Switzerland has contributed a
                                stone with an inscription. Many more similar marks of mutual esteem
                                might be enumerated; suffice it to add the remark that a treaty of
                                friendship and commerce, concluded a few years ago, has but
                                strengthened the relations between the two countries.</p>
                            <p>Switzerland, from the sincere sympathy which she has for the welfare
                                of the Union, looks with anxiety upon the issue of the events which
                                now shake <pb n="337" xml:id="pg_337" facs="0337"/> that country.
                                Switzerland passed through a similar crisis fourteen years ago,
                                which threatened to tear asunder the then loose connexion of the
                                twenty-two cantons. But renewed rose the present confederation from
                                that tempest; strengthened internally and abroad, she now stands
                                there, esteemed by the nations. May God grant that the connexion of
                                the States of the United States of America may also emerge renewed
                                and strengthened out of this crisis.</p>
                            <p>The president of the Swiss confederation presents his best thanks,
                                through your excellency, to the President of the United States for
                                his assurances of friendship and sympathy. He hopes that the new
                                minister resident will thoroughly acquaint himself with our
                                relations and laws. That would render the more possible for him a
                                strict performance of his duties; the projection of the rights and
                                interests of American citizens, and the preservation of a good and
                                ever friendly understanding with the Swiss government, which wishes
                                to unite <hi rend="italic">loyauté</hi> with their maintenance of
                                authority. The President of the confederation may add that he thinks
                                the retiring minister resident has learned to esteem Switzerland,
                                her authorities and nation, and he may give to Mr. Fay the plain
                                assurance that he has acquired the esteem and the love of the
                                country and her magistrates. The President of the confederation
                                doubts not a moment that the relations between the federal council
                                and the present representative of America will always be of the most
                                friendly character.</p>

                            the steamer “Adriatic,” the 14th day of May, I reached Berne <hi
                                rend="italic">via</hi> Galway, London, and Paris, June 21, having
                            previously ascertained by correspondence with my predecessor that it
                            would be agreeable to him for me to take possession of the office,
                            legation property, &amp;c., the 1st day of July.</p>
                        <p>Making it my first duty, after arriving, to call on Mr. Fay at his house,
                            I was received with the utmost frankness and cordiality, and with the
                            offer of every facility to render my entrance upon my new duties
                            pleasant to myself and favorable to the non-interruption of that <hi

                            happily existing between the American legation and the several members
                            of the Swiss government.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Fay very kindly undertook to notify the president of the
                            confederation of my arrival, and ask an audience to enable him to
                            present his own <hi rend="italic">letter of recall</hi>, and myself and
                            my <hi rend="italic">letter of credence</hi> on the Monday following.
                            Having received promise of an audience on the day named, Mr. Fay called
                            with his carriage, and we went together to the palace of the federal
                            council. The sequel has been narrated and transmitted to the State
                            Department by Mr. Fay in his despatch numbered 431, dated July 2,
                            1861.</p>
                        <p>Subsequently we called upon the other members of the Swiss government and
                            upon the foreign ambassadors resident at Berne, to all of whom I was
                            kindly introduced, and by all of whom as cordially received—not without
                            uniform, and, I am sure I may add, sincere expressions of regret at the
                            termination of Mr. Fay’s official relations with the government and the
                            diplomatic corps.</p>
                        <p>During our entire round of visits and presentations it was painfully
                            pleasing to be constantly reminded of the profound interest with which
                            the <pb n="338" xml:id="pg_338" facs="0338"/> contest now going on in
                            the United States, between liberty and union on the one hand, and
                            despotism and secession on the other, is watched alike by the friends of
                            republicanism and of absolutism. Here, however, the rebels have no
                            friends—not even among the representatives of absolutism in Europe On
                            all sides, the sanguine assurances I have felt at liberty to give of the
                            certain triumph of our system and constitution of government over the
                            conspirators for its overthrow, has seemed to give unalloyed
                            satisfaction. That the future may justify these my assurances, will be
                            my constant prayer, with that of millions in other lands.</p>
                        <p>I should not do justice to my own feelings did I omit to say that I have
                            found Mr. Fay a true Christian gentleman, and an American whose heart
                            has, by absence, lost none of its devotion to the liberties and good
                            name of his native land. Thoroughly sympathizing with the principles and
                            purposes of the present administration of the United States government,
                            and possessing large experience and an enviable reputation in Europe, I
                            trust it may not be deemed impertinent in me to express the hope that
                            the State Department will not be a long time in finding some field where
                            his familiarity with international and diplomatic affairs will be a
                            necessity to the government.</p>
                        <p>With an ardent desire for the preservation of the free spirit of our
                            government and the integrity of our national Union, I have the honor to
                            subscribe myself, with the highest consideration, your obedient

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Among the important instructions addressed
                            to your predecessor are those concerning the restrictions of certain of
                            the Swiss cantons against citizens of the United States professing
                            Judaism—a subject which received at Mr. Fay’s hands a large share of
                            earnest attention, and upon which he addressed the department repeatedly
                            and at much length. It is very desirable that his efforts to procure the
                            removal of the restrictions referred to—which, though not completely
                            successful, have no doubt had much effect in smoothing the way to such a
                            result—should be followed up by you. You will, therefore, after having
                            fully acquainted yourself with what Mr. Fay has done in the premises,
                            and with the views of the department, as expressed to him in the
                            despatches on file in the legation, take such steps as you may deem
                            judicious and likely to advance the benevolent object in question.</p>
                        <p>It is not doubted that further proper appeals to the justice and
                            liberality of the authorities of the several cantons whose laws
                            discriminate against Israelitish citizens of the United States will
                            result in a removal of the odious restrictions and a recognition of the

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The government is preoccupied with the
                            civil war which has been inaugurated with the reckless purpose of
                            overthrowing the Constitution and the federal Union. It has little time
                            to think of our foreign relations, and when it does think of them it is
                            chiefly to consider how and in what way it can most effectually
                            counteract the efforts of the revolutionists to procure European
                            intervention in their favor.</p>
                        <p>The Netherlands lost even their independence for a time through the
                            disastrous operations of the French revolution of 1789. They are slowly,
                            but surely, recovering advantages and prestige which they enjoyed before
                            that calamity occurred. Their policy is peace and friendship with all
                            nations, and certainly they have always manifested the most liberal
                            sentiments towards the United States. In view of these circumstances and
                            dispositions the President does not apprehend any danger that the
                            government of the Netherlands, or its very intelligent people, will lend
                            aid, countenance, or sympathy to the misguided partisans who, in a
                            frenzy of passion, are compassing the ruin of our country.</p>
                        <p>I have looked through the correspondence of this department with your
                            legation, and I find that, although our commerce is known in every part
                            of the world, and although the Netherlands have no insignificant
                            possessions in each of its great continental divisions, yet that there
                            is not even one case of controversy or dispute between the two
                            nations.</p>
                        <p>What, then, will you do at the Hague? You can do much, and, first, in
                            relation to Japan. The government of the Netherlands is probably an ally
                            of Japan. I enclose the copy of a note of the 14th instant, addressed by
                            this department to the respective diplomatic representatives of
                            Christian powers here who have treaties with Japan. You will submit the
                            suggestions contained therein to his Majesty’s government, and if they
                            should be frankly received, I shall be prepared to submit a project of a
                            convention to carry them into effect.</p>
                        <p>I have especially called the attention of Baron de Limburg here to this
                            matter, and invited him to consult with his government. Should he comply
                            with this request, your own action will be merely in co-operation with
                            him, and the needful negotiations may be had with him here if his
                            government shall prefer.</p>
                        <p>The government of the Netherlands may perhaps have forgotten that New
                            York, one of the largest and most prosperous of these States, was
                            colonized by emigrants from that country, and that their descendants
                            still cherish lively affection for the land of their ancestors. The flow
                            of emigration from the Netherlands to this country was arrested by the
                            revolutionary wars which occurred in both countries at the close of the
                            last <pb n="342" xml:id="pg_342" facs="0342"/> century; but it has
                            resumed its course within the last twenty years, and the thrifty
                            adventurers already constitute an important portion of the population in
                            some of our new western States. The intercourse between persons of this
                            class and their relations and friends is very intimate. All who come
                            hither from the Netherlands, whether as settlers or transient
                            passengers, are admitted and enjoy entire freedom of movement, and are
                            never required to exhibit a passport under any circumstances. It is a
                            fact very honorable to themselves, and to their native country, that not
                            one of them has ever manifested a purpose or even a thought of hostility
                            against this government. I am sure that the citizens of the United
                            States who have occasion to visit the Netherlands are equally free from
                            any sentiments of unkindness, or of hostility against the government or
                            people of that country. Why, then, should not the government of the
                            Netherlands relax the rigor of its police system so far as to dispense
                            with the requirement that the citizen of the United States shall arm
                            himself with a passport when visiting that country? The President
                            desires that you submit these thoughts to the minister for foreign
                            affairs in an earnest, but not importunate manner. If they should be
                            favorably received, you will be authorized to enter into a convention to
                            give them effect.</p>
                        <p>One of our first treaties was made with the Netherlands in the year 1782.
                            Article XIX of that treaty was as follows:</p>
                        <p>“No subject of their high mightinesses, the states general of the United
                            Netherlands, shall apply for or take any commission or letters of marque
                            for arming any ship or ships to act as privateers against the said
                            United States of America, or any of them, or the subjects and
                            inhabitants of the said United States, or any of them, or against the
                            property of the inhabitants of any of them, from any prince or State
                            with which the United States of America may happen to be at war; nor
                            shall any subject or inhabitant of the said United States of America, or
                            any of them, apply for or take any commission or letters of marque for
                            arming any ship or ships to act as privateers against the high and
                            mighty lords, the states general of the United Netherlands, or against
                            the subjects of their high mightinesses, or any of them, or against the
                            property of any one of them, from any prince or State with which their
                            high mightinesses may be at war. And if any person of either nation
                            shall take such commission or letters of marque, he shall be punished as
                            a pirate.”</p>
                        <p>There have been several changes of the government of the Netherlands
                            since that time, and it has thus become doubtful whether that treaty is
                            now in force.</p>
                        <p>You will have perceived in the archives of the legation a letter which
                            was addressed to you on the 10th instant, on the subject of the
                            amendments to the law of nations in regard to the laws of maritime war
                            applicable to neutrals, which was proposed by the congress at Paris in
                            1856. It is presumed that the government of the Netherlands will be well
                            disposed to enter into a convention for the acceptance of these
                            propositions, the material one being in effect the same as the treaty
                            stipulations to which I have thus referred.</p>

                            predecessor, No. 37, of the 28th of February last, in relation to the
                            so-called “Confederate States of America.” Upon receiving it I called
                            upon the minister of foreign affairs and inquired whether any person or
                            agent had presented himself to this government on behalf of those
                            States; and, upon receiving an answer in the negative, I desired him, in
                            case any person should do so, to inform me immediately, and before any
                            action should be had to receive such representative, as I would in that
                            case make a communication to him on the subject. He promised me that he
                            would do so. I did not deem it necessary to be more explicit at the
                            present time.</p>
                        <p>Since my former despatch there has been a resignation of all the members
                            of the ministry, and a reconstruction of the cabinet. Some of the old
                            members have been reinstated, but most of the members are new
                            appointments. The ministry of foreign affairs has been devolved upon
                            Baron T. P. P. de Zueglen de Nyevelt—not the late minister of the same
                            name, though he occupied the same post a number of years since.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your circular despatch of the 9th of March, in regard to the
                            intervention of foreign powers in the domestic affairs of the United
                            States at the present time. In compliance with the instructions
                            contained therein, I immediately addressed the minister of foreign
                            affairs of this government a communication, of which a copy is annexed
                            to this despatch. The King is at present on his annual visit to
                            Amsterdam, and will not probably return under ten days; and I presume
                            nothing will be done in the ministry of an important character until he
                            shall have returned. No person has yet appeared here on behalf of the
                            seceding States; and if any one or more should come on their account, I
                            apprehend nothing will be done by the Dutch government until the great
                            powers shall have acted in regard to an acknowledgment of their
                            independence or a treaty. You may rest assured that the present
                            difficulties in the United States are regarded by this government with
                            regret, and that it will do nothing to encourage the seceding States
                            under existing circumstances. I speak, however, on this subject, as yet,
                            of course without any official intimation, and merely from the tone and
                            temper of the well-informed circles—as well those connected with the
                            government as others. There is in the Dutch character a strong
                            repugnance to political changes, except when a strong sense of wrong and
                            injury exists. The government and people, as you well know, are
                            conservative beyond any other nation. I will not fail, however, to
                            inform you of everything which shall transpire here on this subject, and
                            without delay.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, sir, yours respectfully,</p>

                            <p>The undersigned, minister resident of the United States of America,
                                has the honor to address his excellency Baron Van Zuylen Van
                                Nijevelt, minister of foreign affairs of his Majesty the King of the
                                Netherlands, on the subject of the present complication of the
                                internal political affairs of the United States, and, for the better
                                understanding of the views of his government in relation thereto, to
                                invite the attention of his excellency to the accompanying address
                                of the President on assuming the administration of the federal
                                Union. His excellency will find therein a statement of the alleged
                                grievances, of the revolutionary nature of the proceedings of a
                                number of the States of the Union which have attempted to secede and
                                have formed a provisional government of their own, and of the line
                                of policy which the government of the Union will pursue for the
                                purpose of preserving peace and for the maintenance of the
                                Union.</p>
                            <p>The undersigned will further remark, in explanation of this statement
                                of the President in regard to the character of the secession
                                movement, that the government of the United States is not simply a
                                confederation, but a union, which has been invested by the people of
                                the different States, acting in their original sovereign capacity,
                                with certain powers, which are exclusive and paramount throughout
                                the republic, such as the making of war and peace, the regulation of
                                commerce, whether between the States themselves or with foreign
                                nations, the establishment of post offices and post roads, the
                                defining and punishing piracies and felonies on the high seas, the
                                maintenance of a navy, and the laying and collecting taxes and
                                duties for the common defence and welfare, besides various others
                                entirely of a domestic bearing, but all operating on all the States
                                and the citizens thereof as one people. In other words, in all that
                                concerns the foreign relations of the several States, as well as in
                                many details of internal regulation, the United States are as much a
                                consolidated government as the kingdom of the Netherlands, with its
                                provincial divisions and assemblies—the only difference being, that
                                in the United States all powers not granted to the federal
                                government are reserved to the States and the people, and,
                                consequently, original and more extensive powers are exercised by
                                the legislatures of the several States. Any attempt, therefore, on
                                the part of any State or number of States, or of any section of a
                                State, to interfere with the exercise of the powers conferred on the
                                general government by the Constitution is revolutionary; and any
                                pretended or actual exercise of like powers by them is an
                                usurpation.</p>
                            <p>The condition of affairs now existing in the United States is
                                altogether of an anomalous character, arising from the principles
                                upon which the government is founded. Those principles acknowledge
                                the right of self-government in the people, and the exercise of
                                perfect freedom of speech, of assemblage, and of the press. A
                                majority of the electors, in the manner and under the forms
                                prescribed by the Constitution, elect the President, and thus give
                                administrative vitality to the government. In the canvass preceding
                                the election, which takes place every four years, discussions of
                                subjects of vital interest to the country are carried on in the
                                press and on the stump with such effect that, although the voting
                                body comprises over three millions of persons, probably not five per
                                cent of the whole number fail to vote on such occasions. Popular
                                passion is aroused, every motive is appealed to by the rival
                                parties, and, when a conclusion is reached, there is often times a
                                feeling of disappointment on the part of the minority. But this <pb
                                    n="345" xml:id="pg_345" facs="0345"/> feeling has never
                                heretofore interfered with their loyal submission to the will of the
                                majority. In the recent canvass, the questions connected with the
                                institution of slavery were almost exclusively agitated, principally
                                in regard to its extension into the Territories, or, as it might be
                                termed in this country, the lands of the generality. The decision of
                                the people has been adverse to such extension, but altogether by the
                                votes of the non-slaveholding States. Advantage has been taken of
                                this circumstance by designing men to make the minority, or rather
                                that portion of it residing in the slave-holding States, believe
                                that their constitutional rights, in regard to that species of
                                property known as slaves, were in danger of being destroyed by the
                                majority. The fear of such a consequence is groundless; but, acting
                                upon such apprehensions, the people of the seceding States have
                                precipitated themselves into their present position.</p>
                            <p>No complaint has been made in any quarter of any improper act of the
                                general government, or of any violation by it of its powers, or of
                                the rights of slaveholders, as a ground for the existing discontent.
                                The evils are anticipatory only, so far as the action of the general
                                government is concerned. On the other hand it is true that,
                                notwithstanding the apprehensions and fears which have been excited
                                in the bosoms of a portion of the American people in regard to the
                                policy of the government, and the steps which have been taken by
                                them for the formation of an independent government, it is not to be
                                doubted that the great majority of the people of those seceding
                                States still cherish a love for the Union of their fathers, its
                                memories, its prestige, and its blessings. Independent of this fact,
                                the permanent dismemberment of the Union is fraught with so much
                                evil to them, as well as to the country at large, as to justify the
                                belief that a calm view of the consequences, combined with their
                                patriotism, will cause them to retrace their steps. A separate
                                government on their part entails the necessity not only of an entire
                                new corps of officers of government, but also of a standing army
                                where none now is necessary, of an independent navy, of a cordon of
                                revenue officers along an extensive coast and frontier line; all
                                attended with heavy expense and increased taxes. These consequences,
                                and the severance of family ties and brotherhood existing between
                                individuals residing in different States, are to come home to them
                                when passion and delusion shall have passed away; and when they
                                shall discover, as discover they will, that the general government
                                entertains no designs against their peace or property, but on the
                                other hand will, as it is bound to do, defend both.</p>
                            <p>The undersigned would also impress upom the government of his Majesty
                                the fact that no one questions the election of the President
                                according to the provisions of the Constitution. He is the choice of
                                the country, and is fairly entitled to the exercise of all the
                                powers conferred upon the executive head of the federal government
                                by the Constitution. Every citizen within every State is bound to
                                obedience to his lawful authority. It is the sworn duty of the
                                President to administer faithfully the Constitution and laws of the
                                United States, and the obligation of every citizen and individual is
                                perfect to uphold and sustain him in its performance. But the
                                President will seek by a just and liberal administration, and by a
                                paternal regard for the rights and feelings of all sections of the
                                country, to give occasion and opportunity for the deliberate and
                                loyal action of the people. It is under these circumstances that the
                                President entertains the fullest confidence in the restoration of
                                the harmony and unity of the government at no very distant day.</p>
                            <p>The friendship and good will which his Majesty the King of the
                                Netherlands has always manifested towards the United States, the
                                President regards as an assurance that his Majesty’s government will
                                not yield to solicitations to intervene in any unfriendly way in the
                                domestic affairs of the United States. It is evident that any
                                encouragement to disaffection <pb n="346" xml:id="pg_346"
                                    facs="0346"/> from abroad would thwart the efforts of the
                                President for a reconciliation and defeat his just expectations in
                                that regard. It is a question, moreover, which involves important
                                interests to all nations with which the United States are in
                                commercial relation, and to all constitutional governments. The form
                                of government which the people of the United States have adopted is
                                one which experience has proven is best adapted for the peace and
                                protection of the States, for the welfare of the people, and for the
                                development of the enterprise and resources of its vast territory.
                                Nor has its influence, it is believed, been without its salutary
                                effect upon the fatherlands, whence that population has originally
                                sprung.</p>
                            <p>It has, however, been a government of example only as to other
                                nations, and has steadily pursued the policy of not interfering with
                                their internal affairs. Under it close commercial relations have
                                sprung up, particularly with all the western powers of Europe, and
                                with the kingdom of the Netherlands have never for a moment—now more
                                than three-fourths of a century—been interrupted. If at present
                                there happen some inconveniences to the trading interests of the
                                subjects of his Majesty, it will be the endeavor of the President to
                                render them as light and transient as possible; and should any
                                injury be sustained therefrom by the subjects of his Majesty, the
                                President is determined, the undersigned is instructed to say, that
                                they shall, so far as it may rest with him, be amply indemnified.
                                Should a state of civil war be precipitated, by any cause whatever,
                                those inconveniences would be turned into evils of a wide-spread and
                                disastrous character to other nations. Not only would the channels
                                of commerce be closed, or, at least, seriously interrupted, and the
                                agricultural and mining products of the United States, many of which
                                have become necessary for other nations, be withheld; but the
                                political systems of Europe and the cause of well regulated and
                                constitutional government would suffer everywhere. A state of
                                anarchy must ensue if the revolution be pursued. It is not to be
                                expected that an empire of thirty-one millions of souls can be
                                broken up, and the glories and blessings of its free government be
                                thrown away at the behest of six millions, one-half of whom only are
                                of the white race. The policy hitherto has been, on the part of the
                                general government, and will continue to be, to avert such a
                                calamity; and in asking the non-intervention of friendly nations,
                                while it pursues a course of peace itself, it demands, it is
                                confidently believed, what is most consistent with the cause of
                                humanity and good government everywhere. And to no power is this
                                caution addressed with more confidence than to his Majesty the King
                                of the Netherlands.</p>
                            <p>The undersigned embraces this occasion to renew to his excellency
                                Baron Van Zuylen Van Nijevelt the assurance of his high

                                has the honor to bring at the same time to the knowledge of Mr.
                                Murphy that, already in the month of December last, the envoy of the
                                King at Washington had recommended to the Dutch consuls in the
                                United States to abstain from all intervention in the political
                                affairs of the country within their jurisdiction, and that this

                            recognition of the independence of the seceding States until the great
                            powers of Europe have taken their ground, and that it will follow them

                            <p>The undersigned, minister for foreign affairs, has had the honor to
                                receive the note which Mr. Murphy, minister resident of the United
                                States of America, has pleased to address to him on the subject of
                                the existing complications of political affairs in the United
                                States; the said note being accompanied, for the better
                                understanding of the views of his government, by the address
                                delivered by his excellency the President on assuming the
                                administration of the federal Union.</p>
                            <p>In calling, by his note, the attention of the undersigned to the
                                exposition contained in the address of the wrongs alleged by some
                                States of the Union, of their proceedings to attempt a separation,
                                and the formation of a separated provisional government, as well as
                                on the line of conduct which the federal government proposes to
                                follow for the purpose of preserving peace and upholding the Union,
                                Mr. Murphy further remarks, in explaining this part of the
                                President’s address, upon the character of the secessional movement,
                                that the government of the United States is not merely a
                                confederation but a Union, invested by the people of the different
                                States with powers, exclusive and controllng throughout the
                                republic—powers which, embracing the foreign relations and numerous
                                details of domestic interest, operate over all the States and over
                                their citizens collectively, so that, adds the note, any attempt of
                                any State, of a number of States, or of any part of a State, to
                                interrupt the exercise of the powers confided to the general
                                government is revolutionary; and any exercise, pretended or real on
                                their part, of like powers, is usurpation.</p>
                            <p>After having enunciated these principles as the basis of the general
                                government, and pointed out the mode established for the election of
                                President, the minister resident enters into some details about the
                                recent election of the actual President; the result is, that on
                                former elections the will of the <pb n="348" xml:id="pg_348"
                                    facs="0348"/> majority has been loyally submitted to, but that
                                this example has not been followed by the minority in respect to Mr.
                                Lincoln, whose election, furthermore, is in nowise contested in
                                regard of its constitutional validity. This fact the said note
                                attributes to apprehensions entertained in the slave States that a
                                blow might be aimed at this portion of their property—apprehensions
                                which nothing in the intentions of the general government justify,
                                but which have prepared the way upon which those States have
                                rushed.</p>
                            <p>Nevertheless and despite the fears excited among a noticeable portion
                                of the American people, notwithstanding the attempt made to form an
                                independent government, the government of the United States is
                                persuaded, according to the note, that the great majority of the
                                people in the separatist States will constantly preserve its regard
                                for the Union of their fathers, their memory, their influence, and
                                their greatness. But, independently of this fact, the mischiefs and
                                disadvantages which a permanent dismemberment of the Union would
                                draw, as well upon the separating States as upon the country
                                generally, justifies the expectation that upon a calm review of the
                                circumstances they will come back upon a better track.</p>
                            <p>The President, flattering himself that he will see the harmony and
                                unity of the government soon established, and relying on the
                                friendship and good understanding existing between the two
                                countries, expresses through the channel of Mr. Murphy his
                                confidence that his Majesty the King of the Netherlands will not
                                lend himself to applications for interference in the domestic
                                affairs of the United States, unless in an amicable and conciliatory
                                sense, nor to any encouragement whatever of the disaffected, which
                                would only counteract the efforts of the President to bring about a
                                reconciliation.</p>
                            <p>Finally, Mr. Murphy wishes to give assurance that the President will
                                strongly endeavor to lessen as much as possible the inconveniences
                                which must result to commerce from the actual condition of things,
                                and that he proposes to indemnify the injury which the subjects of
                                his Majesty may suffer as far as may depend upon him.</p>
                            <p>The undersigned having placed the above-mentioned note before the
                                King, his Majesty was particularly grieved by its contents. He has
                                charged me to signify this to the minister resident, adding that if
                                he deeply deplores the situation in which the United States are for
                                the moment placed, nevertheless he has been happy to witness the
                                confidence which the government expresses of being able to surmount
                                existing difficulties; that he entertains the most sincere wishes
                                for the success of the efforts which will be made for the purpose of
                                saving and preserving not only the interests of the States of the
                                Union, but also the interests of the political and commercial world
                                in general.</p>
                            <p>The undersigned, in acquitting himself of these orders by these
                                presents, has the honor at the same time to bring to Mr. Murphy’s
                                knowledge that, so long ago as the month of December, the King’s
                                envoy at Washington directed the consuls of the Netherlands in the
                                United States to abstain from any interference whatever in political
                                affairs in the districts of the consular offices, and that this
                                prescription was approved afterwards by the government of the
                                Netherlands.</p>
                            <p>The undersigned seizes this occasion to reiterate to Mr. Murphy the
                                assurances of his high consideration.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inform you that no
                            communication has as yet been made to this government on behalf of the
                            seceding States; nor, as far as I can learn, has any attempt been made
                            by private persons to fit out vessels to attack our commerce. I have
                            received a letter from an officer of the Dutch cavalry, tendering his
                            services to the United States, but I have declined to forward the same
                            to my government, assuring him that the people of the United States
                            would dispose of the question themselves. On the other hand, it is not
                            to be disguised that public sentiment here is much more favorable to the
                            seceding States than it has been. The message of Mr. Davis, recently
                            delivered to the congress of those States, has been extensively
                            published here, in substance, not at full length, and has had much
                            influence on the question from the specious ground of the Union being a
                            mere confederation of independent States. Besides, Holland, or the
                            Netherlands, has had a bitter lesson of experience under similar
                            circumstances. The rebellion of Belgium, in 1830, was resisted with all
                            the power of this government, which would probably have succeeded in
                            crushing it if England and France had not interfered, and the immense
                            public debt with which this country is oppressed was then mostly
                            incurred, while Belgium was, notwithstanding, lost. Reasoning from this
                            point of view, there are not a few who regard the present position of
                            the United States an expensive and useless effort. I state these
                            circumstances for your information.</p>
                        <p>The affairs of this country are in a prosperous condition. The great
                            calamities by inundation both here at home and also in Java have shown
                            that there is abundant resources to meet such misfortunes. They have
                            called forth and received liberal contributions from private persons,
                            without requiring any aid from the government. Political matters are
                            quiet. The first chamber of the states general is now in session, and is
                            engaged in considering the bills adopted by the other body, the most
                            important of which are those relating to the budget and the
                            reorganization of the judiciary.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor, sir, to be yours respectfully,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I hasten to inform you that his Majesty
                            the King of Holland received me to-day in private audience, agreeably to
                            the prescribed ceremonial, and that I delivered to him in person my
                            credentials as minister resident of the United States at this court.</p>
                        <p>I arrived here on the first day of the present month and have waited till
                            now for my audience. In my interview with his Majesty I took occasion to
                            express the earnest desire of the President to maintain and cultivate
                            those friendly relations that have so long and so happily subsisted
                            between the United States and Holland, and especially with his Majesty’s
                            government. <pb n="350" xml:id="pg_350" facs="0350"/> I further observed
                            that it would be my cherished aim, as it would be my most pleasing duty,
                            in the discharge of my official duties, to foster and promote the good
                            understanding now existing between the two countries. The King received
                            me graciously, and promptly came forward to receive my credentials, and
                            at once entered upon some friendly inquiries as to whether I had been in
                            the country before or had been elsewhere in the diplomatic service. I
                            replied that our American diplomatists generally were not educated after
                            the European method, and that we labored under some disadvantage in
                            consequence. His Majesty remarked that he had had the pleasure to meet
                            Mr. Buchanan in Holland after he had served in Russia and in England.
                            After some further brief conversation, in which the King expressed his
                            pleasure at making my acquaintance, the audience terminated.</p>
                        <p>I found, on my arrival here, your despatch, No. 2, of the date of the
                            10th of May, covering a circular of the 6th of that month, in relation
                            to agents of insurrectionary assemblages sent to Europe on errands
                            hostile to the peace of the United States; also a copy of a despatch of
                            the 24th of April, addressed to the several ministers of the United
                            States accredited to the maritime powers whose plenipotentiaries
                            composed the congress at Paris the 16th of April, 1856, calling their
                            attention to the importance of endeavoring to negotiate with those
                            powers conventions upon the subject of the rights of belligerents and
                            neutrals in time of war; also the draft of a convention in reference to
                            the subject therein discussed, with a full power and instructions to
                            execute the same with the government of the Netherlands. I shall lose no
                            time in communicating with the Dutch government upon the subject.
                            Meantime I will observe that in an informal conversation with the
                            minister of foreign affairs, since my arrival, I learned from him that
                            Holland was the first power, not present at the convention referred to,
                            to acquiesce in the propositions there laid down.</p>
                        <p rend="center">* * * * * * * *</p>
                        <p>I cannot learn that any agent or agents of the seceding States have
                            appeared in Holland for any purpose connected with their revolutionary
                            or warlike plans, and from what I see and hear I conclude that no
                            countenance would be given to them if they should.</p>
                        <p>The death of Count Cavour, the news of which reached here the morning of
                            his decease, has created a profound sensation in diplomatic circles and
                            is deeply deplored by the friends of Italy as an irreparable loss to
                            that country.</p>
                        <p>I beg to add that I have found my predecessor, Mr. Murphy, unceasing in
                            his endeavors to facilitate my labors here, and it gives me unfeigned
                            pleasure to bear this testimony in his behalf, and to the highly
                            honorable position which I believe him to hold among his colleagues.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, with great respect, your obedient servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have taken the earliest opportunity to
                            have an interview with the minister of foreign affairs upon the
                            condition of the internal concerns of the United States, and also upon
                            the subject matter of your despatch No. 2, to which I referred in my
                            last.</p>
                        <pb n="351" xml:id="pg_351" facs="0351"/>
                        <p>I assured him of the determined purpose of the United States government
                            to put down the rebellion of the seceding States at all hazards, and
                            stated its determination to adopt whatever measures are necessary to
                            accomplish that object. I explained to him the character of the
                            rebellion, and showed it to be merely a war in behalf of African
                            slavery, and that if we had no slavery we should have no war and no
                            rebellion. I further explained that the government possessed
                            extraordinary means of ending the rebellion whenever it chose to employ
                            them. The union of the States could be restored whenever the government
                            saw fit to render the institutions of the several States homogeneous.
                            For when they were once made free States there would be no wish to
                            separate and no tendency to separation. But I observed that the
                            government was desirous to adopt only moderate measures, and hoped that
                            such measures would be sufficient to cause the leaders of the rebellion
                            to succumb and to restore peace. But to accomplish the high object of
                            maintaining the government and preserving the territory of the country
                            from dismemberment, it was ready to make any sacrifice of mere material
                            interests that necessity demanded. I showed that the government had
                            abundant resources, and more men offering for the military service than
                            it could employ.</p>
                        <p>The minister of foreign affairs, in reply to my inquiries, informed me
                            that no agent or agents of the seceding States had appeared here, though
                            he had heard they were in London. He said they would receive no
                            countenance if they were to come. He observed that the Dutch government
                            had considered the question of the proposed letters of marque to be
                            issued by the seceding States, and were upon the point of issuing a
                            proclamation and orders forbidding the use of their ports by privateers,
                            a copy of which he said he would furnish me as soon as issued.</p>
                        <p>He expressed the opinion that the powers of Europe were unanimously in
                            favor of the Paris declaration abolishing privateering, and said if the
                            United States would concur in it, that privateers would have to be
                            regarded as “sea-robbers.” He believed there would be no opposition to
                            negotiating treaties, based on the propositions of the Paris conference,
                            with all the European powers which had agreed to them, of which Holland
                            was one.</p>
                        <p>The minister seemed to be aware of the causeless character of the
                            rebellion in the seceding States, and of the ability of the government
                            to deal with it, concurring in the opinion that we had more men than
                            were needed.</p>
                        <p>He informed me that his government had ordered four ships-of-war to be in
                            readiness to sail for America to look after its commercial interests
                            there, and that the first ship would be despatched on the 15th instant,
                            and that the others would speedily follow. I subsequently learned from
                            the minister of marine that the fleet would consist of two frigates and
                            two brigs-of-war, and that after the flag-ship had communicated with the
                            Dutch minister at Washington, the fleet would rendezvous at Curaçoa, and
                            spend the winter in the West India seas.</p>
                        <p>I forebore to press the question of the immediate negotiation of a treaty
                            in reference to privateering. Having satisfied myself of the favorable
                            disposition of the government in respect to the question, and having
                            learned its intention to issue the proclamation and orders referred to,
                            and intimated with sufficient distinctness the ground the United States
                            government was now disposed to occupy on that subject, I thought it
                            prudent to await further developments of the question by our ministers
                            at the courts of France and England, whose example Holland would be sure
                            to wait for. I did not deem <pb n="352" xml:id="pg_352" facs="0352"/> it

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I received yesterday your circular of the
                            20th of May, relating to the purchase of articles in Europe, contraband
                            of war, for the use of persons in insurrection against the United States
                            government.</p>
                        <p rend="center">* * * * * * </p>
                        <p rend="center">* * * * * * </p>
                        <p>The extraordinary unanimity and energy displayed by the government and
                            loyal people of the United States in their measures to suppress the
                            rebellion of the seceding States excites constant comment and high
                            admiration in all quarters on this side of the Atlantic. The echoes of
                            the first utterances of the British trading public, in favor of
                            permitting the peaceable secession of the revolting States, have quite
                            died away, and, instead, is now heard denunciation of the folly and
                            madness of the secessionists, along with the expression of a general
                            judgment that they will inevitably be forced to succumb. The growth of
                            this sentiment, fostered by the character of the almost daily news from
                            America, is strengthening the cause of the government on this side of
                            the Atlantic and correspondingly weakening the cause of the
                            secessionists. I think, therefore, that the whole weight of European
                            opinion, which naturally desires a speedy end to the war, will soon be
                            thrown in great force against the revolting States, and thus furnish
                            important moral aid in putting an end to the struggle. I am satisfied,
                            from what has come under my personal observation, that the high tone
                            adopted by the United States government in regard to foreign
                            interference in behalf of the secessionists has had a most salutary
                            influence upon the action of European governments, great and small. Many
                            of them have no objection to seeing the United States in difficulty; but
                            they entertain a healthy apprehension that our government may find a
                            speedy way out of it, and retain a lively recollection of those who
                            would take advantage of its temporary embarrassments.</p>

                            servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have obtained from the minister of
                            foreign affairs copies of the proclamations about to be issued by this
                            government in relation to the letters of marque recently issued by the
                            Montgomery revolutionists.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to enclose the copies transmitted to me in the original
                            Dutch. I see the instructions to ministers forbid the application of the
                            contingent fund to pay translators, and I infer from this that the
                            department prefers original documents. These papers warn the Dutch
                            people against privateering, as an unlawful proceeding which may be
                            deemed piracy, and they forbid the use of the ports of the Netherlands
                            to privateers under any flag. They refer also to the fact of the
                            adhesion of Holland to the declaration of the congress of Paris, in
                            respect to maritime rights, made in 1856. It will likewise be observed
                            that the Dutch government abstains from following the British example in
                            excluding prizes brought in by ships-of-war.</p>

                                kingdom, that during the existing disturbances in the United States
                                of America they in nowise take part in privateering, because the
                                Netherlands government has acceded to the declaration upon maritime
                                rights set forth by the Paris conference of 1856, whereby, among
                                other matters, privateering is abolished, and no recognition of
                                commissions got for letters of marque permitted. Also that
                                commissions and letters of marque, in conflict with the aforesaid
                                prohibition, which may issue to inhabitants of the Netherlands,
                                cannot have a lawful effect in behalf of the King’s subjects, or of
                                any abroad who are in subjection to the laws of the kingdom. Those
                                who, under such circumstances, engage in or lend their aid in
                                privateering to other people, will be considered as pirates, and
                                prosecuted according to law in the Netherlands, and subjected to the
                                punishment provided for the commission of such offences.</p>

                                steam frigate Zealand, and the screw propellers Dyambi and Vesuvius,

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to your last despatch, in which
                            you say “the government has little time to think of its foreign
                            relations, and when it does think of them, it is chiefly to consider how
                            and in what way it can most effectually counteract the efforts of the
                            revolutionists to procure European intervention in their favor,” I beg
                            to observe that within my circle of observation I find no occasion to
                            change the opinion I have heretofore expressed in regard to the general
                            good dispositions of the European governments towards that of the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>That there is any feeling of active sympathy, I should fear to allege.
                            Every nation has its own peculiar, and to itself, important cares and
                            difficulties, and each devotes the most of its time and attentions to
                            these, caring comparatively little for those of others except so for as
                            they affect their own. The domestic disturbances of a country three
                            thousand miles away is thus regarded with a philosophic equanimity, and
                            I think I may say with very great indifference except in respect to the
                            commercial bearing of the events occurring there. But if little especial
                            sympathy is felt for the United States government, still less is felt
                            for the insurgents, whose revolt is seen to have caused the dire
                            calamities now existing. So that we may still be allowed to claim a
                            balance in our favor of the good wishes of European governments.</p>
                        <p>The revolutionary state of things in the United States has been, and is
                            being very generally and thoroughly discussed in European journals, and
                            all such discussion favors, of necessity, the cause of the government.
                            This is especially true of the discussions in the German
                            publications.</p>
                        <p rend="center">* * * * * * * *</p>
                        <p>In Germany, where discussion always partakes more of an absolute nature
                            than anywhere else, from causes not necessary to delineate here,
                            American affairs are more justly and comprehensively handled, and being
                            more completely divested of their transitory features, results as I have
                            stated.</p>
                        <p>On the whole, I think our government and the people it represents have
                            not, thus far, any adequate cause to complain of the attitude of
                            European governments, or the state of European opinion, toward them. The
                            insurgents are nowhere in favor, and certainly have not received so much
                            toleration and encouragement in Europe as was extended to them by a
                            portion of <pb n="356" xml:id="pg_356" facs="0356"/> our own press and
                            by the administration of Mr. Buchanan, previous to the breaking out of
                            the war. * * * * *</p>
                        <p rend="center">* * * * * * * *</p>
                        <p>We all feel the deepest interest in the progress of events at home, and
                            the utmost solicitude to do on this side of the Atlantic whatever is
                            possible to further the ideas and purposes of our government. For my own
                            part I am most anxious to go wherever, and to do whatever, I can to
                            promote the designs and aid the labors of the administration in the
                            great work devolved upon them.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, with the highest respect, your obedient
                            servant,</p>

                        <p>You will receive herewith, confidentially, a copy of my last despatch to
                            Mr. Dayton on the subject of the proffer of our adhesion to the
                            declaration of the congress of Paris. It will serve, I think, to relieve
                            your uncertainty, and to indicate the course you shall pursue. Only
                            Great Britain and France have assumed to say to us that they regard our
                            country as divided or broken, for any purpose, whether of war or of
                            peace. And we have not thought proper to receive that communication from
                            them. We treat as being the sovereign government over all the Union—the
                            disloyal and the loyal, all alike—or we do not treat at all. This simple
                            statement will, perhaps, be necessary to make the paper addressed to Mr.
                            Dayton clearly intelligible to you.</p>
                        <p>These latter remarks you will consider as confidential.</p>

                            (No. 6) has been received. The President is gratified with the just and
                            proper sentiments expressed by the government of Holland concerning the
                            United States.</p>
                        <p>Subsequently to the sending of my despatch to you concerning the affairs
                            of the western powers in Japan, communications have been received from
                            the Tycoon, and his ministers for foreign affairs, measurably supported
                            by Mr. Harris, our excellent representatative there, urging a delay in
                            opening the ports under the treaty in terms so strong that the President
                            has concluded that I shall have a conference here with the
                            representatives of the powers interested in the question. This
                            conference will be held next week. You will be advised of whatever is
                            considered.</p>
                        <p>We have met a reverse in arms. But though at first it seemed appalling,
                            because it was as severe as it was unexpected, yet the result is even
                            now seen to be only a signal for greater effort and more determined
                            resolution.</p>
                        <p>I send you, confidentially, a copy of my most recent despatch to Mr.
                            Adams.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: We learn, in a manner which obliges us to
                            give unwilling credit, that the Sumter, an armed steamer, well known
                            through all the American seas to be a privateer fitted out for and
                            actually engaged in depredations upon the commerce of the United States
                            by some disloyal citizens, under the command of an officer named Semmes,
                            on or about the 17th of July last, entered the port of Curaçoa and
                            communicated directly with the local authorities <pb n="358"
                                xml:id="pg_358" facs="0358"/> of that island; that she was
                            hospitably received there and was permitted to take a large quantity of
                            coals, (said to be 120 tons,) and also to take on board a large supply
                            of provisions; that the privateer’s crew was allowed entire freedom in
                            the place; that when one of the crew had deserted, an order was given by
                            the authorities of the port for his arrest; that the attempt for that
                            purpose having proved unsuccessful, the same authorities pledged
                            themselves that the arrest should be afterwards effectually made, and
                            that the deserter should be held in custody, to be surrendered to the
                            pirate captain on his return homeward to the island.</p>
                        <p>You are instructed to bring this matter immediately to the notice of the
                            government of the Netherlands. The subject of damages for so great a
                            violation of the rights of the United States will be considered when we
                            shall have properly verified the facts of the case. In the mean time you
                            will ask the government of the Netherlands for any explanation of the
                            transaction it may be able or see fit to give. You will further say that
                            the United States, if the case thus stated shall prove to be correct,
                            will expect, in view of the treaties existing between the two countries,
                            and the principles of the law of nations, as well as upon the ground of
                            assurances recently received from the goveror of the Netherlands, that
                            it will disown the action of its authorities at Curaçoa, and will adopt
                            efficient means to prevent a recurrence of such proceedings hereafter.
                            If the case thus presented shall not be found entirely erroneous, or be
                            very essentially modified, the United States will expect that the
                            governor of the island of Curaçoa will be promptly made to feel the
                            severe displeasure of the government of the Netherlands, a country with
                            which we have lived on terms of unbroken friendship for three quarters
                            of a century.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I avail myself of the departure of my
                            predecessor, Mr. Murphy, for America, who sails in the Arago from Havre
                            on the 20th instant, to send you this communication.</p>
                        <p>The news from America to the 8th instant, which comes to-day by
                            telegraph, is received with satisfaction. The continued successes in
                            Missouri; the election of a majority of Union representatives to the
                            Kentucky legislature, giving renewed assurance of the conservative
                            position of that important State; the prevailing quiet in Maryland and
                            Delaware; and the failure of the confederate commanders to take any
                            advantage of their recent extraordinary good fortune, all tend to
                            reproduce the general state of feeling that prevailed on this side of
                            the Atlantic before the occurrence of the disaster at Bull Run.</p>
                        <p>But there has never been anything here to correspond to what appears to
                            have been the momentary depression and alarm felt at home after the
                            repulse of our troops. The event was never regarded here to be of great
                            significance, as it was a flight without a pursuit, and a victory of
                            which the victor was not aware.</p>
                        <p>The reverse seems now to be all summed up in the fact of a failure to
                            advance on the part of the Union forces.</p>
                        <pb n="359" xml:id="pg_359" facs="0359"/>
                        <p>Still it is not to be disguised that the obstacles to be overcome in
                            reducing the insurgents are regarded to be formidable when the large
                            armed force they have been able to bring into the field is considered.
                            There exists, however, a consideration which seems to check confidence
                            in their ability to hold out, resting on the general belief of their
                            destitution of resources to maintain a large body of troops in the
                            field, and that the lapse of time will thus operate unfavorably on their
                            levies.</p>
                        <p>Your despatch of the 26th of July (No. 12) is received. I am gratified to
                            know that I am able to communicate anything which you deem of particular
                            interest.</p>
                        <p>It affords me still greater satisfaction to have your assurance in the

                            enter and replenish her exhausted stock of fuel and supplies with which

                        <p>I think it will prove that the orders of the Dutch government to their
                            colonial authorities to exclude privateers from their ports, which were
                            issued about the middle of June, and of which I apprised you on the 16th
                            of that month in my despatch No. 4, have by some means failed to reach
                            Curaçoa. The ships which were sent out were expected to rendezvous at
                            Curaçoa and winter in those seas. But they may be delaying their visit
                            to avoid the heats of summer. I hope to be able to afford you more
                            detailed information by the next mail, which want of time prevents me
                            from obtaining now in season for this.</p>
                        <p>I thought of suggesting the publication in our newspapers of the Dutch
                            proclamations, copies of which I forwarded to you with the despatch
                            referred to, but I concluded the department did not need my suggestions
                            on that head.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Since writing to you on the 28th ultimo in
                            regard to my action on the strength of the public reports in respect to
                            the steamer Sumter, I have received your despatch, No. 15, under date of
                            the 15th of August, and also its duplicate.</p>
                        <p>I immediately addressed a communication to this government presenting the
                            substance of that despatch. I have since had two interviews with Baron
                            Van Zuylen, the minister of foreign affairs, on the questions involved
                            and likely to be involved in the case. Mr. Van Zuylen has informed me
                            that his government has received a brief communication from the governor
                            of Curaçoa stating that the vessel in question put into the port of
                            Curaçoa in distress, and was not a privateer.</p>
                        <p>In the course of our first interview Baron Van Zuylen dropped the remark
                            that it was probable the vessel was regarded as a ship-of-war of the
                            so-called Confederate States, but he subsequently seemed to desire to
                            withdraw the suggestion.</p>
                        <p>I felt it to be my duty to protest against the idea that aid and
                            countenance could be afforded by a friendly power to the Sumter, though
                            she did assume the character of a ship-of-war of the insurgents. I
                            claimed that were she afforded shelter and supplies on this ground by
                            the authorities at Curaçoa, and should the Dutch government approve the
                            act, it would be, substantially, a recognition of the southern
                            confederacy, and that in my judgment such an act would be regarded by
                            the United States as an unfriendly, and even hostile act, which might
                            lead to the gravest consequences. I held that nothing more need be asked
                            by the so-styled Confederate States, as a practical measure of
                            recognition, than that a ship like the Sumter, claiming to be a national
                            vessel of those States, should be permitted to enter the neighboring
                            ports of foreign nations, and there obtain the necessary means to enable
                            her to depredate upon the commerce of the United States. That such a
                            course on the part of any power, aggravated by the fact that she was
                            unable to obtain such supplies at home, so far from being neutral
                            conduct was really to afford the most efficient aid to the men who were
                            in rebellion against their own government, and plundering and destroying
                            the vessels and property of their fellow citizens on the high seas. I
                            protested against such a doctrine as tending necessarily to the
                            termination of all friendly relations between our government and any
                            government that would tolerate such practices, whether that government
                            were France or England or Spain or Holland. I remarked that it was not
                            for me to judge of the purposes of European powers in regard to the
                            existing state of things in the United States; but if there were to be
                            exhibited a disposition anywhere to take advantage of our present
                            situation, I believed it would be found that such a course could not be
                            taken with impunity now, nor without leading to alienation and
                            bitterness in the future.</p>
                        <p>Baron Van Zuylen hereupon explained that the earnest desire of his
                            government was to maintain friendly relations with the United States,
                            and to do nothing to interrupt the existing harmony between the two
                            countries. That the point in question had not been considered by his
                            government, and that the whole case should receive careful attention so
                            soon as the facts relating to it could be ascertained. He has since sent
                            me a note on the subject, which I enclose.</p>
                        <p>The baron stated to me that the governor of Curaçoa had received the
                            instructions of the Dutch government, and the baron was of the opinion
                            that <pb n="361" xml:id="pg_361" facs="0361"/> the governor had paid too
                            much attention to the letter, overlooking the spirit of the
                            instructions, which remark I took to mean, that as the governor’s
                            instructions only ordered the exclusion of privateers and vessels <hi
                                rend="italic">not</hi> in distress, and that as the Sumter claimed
                            to be a vessel of war, and to be <hi rend="italic">in</hi> distress, the
                            governor had sought to shield his action under this shallow and
                            transparent device of the privateer, which could certainly deceive
                            nobody who was not willing to be deceived.</p>
                        <p>I presume there is no danger of the Dutch government taking any position
                            on this question <hi rend="italic">in haste</hi>, as that is not their
                            way. It is quite probable they will take time to send to Curçaoa for
                            facts and particulars. Meantime the British government seem likely to
                            have to act on the same question, as I see the Sumter has been at
                            Trinidad, which will afford them a precedent, for which I am the more
                            sorry, as I learned enough while I was in England to satisfy me that
                            that government was likely to indulge in loose practices in regard to
                            vessels sailing under the confederate flag.</p>
                        <p>But there is nothing in the circumstances or dispositions of this
                            government, in my opinion, to induce them to exhibit unfriendliness to
                            us or grant favors to the confederates, whatever there may be on the
                            part of some of their slaveholding governors, of whom I infer him of
                            Curaçoa to be one. I expect therefore to find the authorities here
                            pursue a course void of offence towards the United States, however
                            others may act. I shall make it my endeavor to induce the minister of
                            foreign affairs to have sent out at once such instructions to the West
                            Indies as will prevent the Sumter, or her confederates, from making use
                            of the Dutch ports in future, whatever their pretensions.</p>
                        <p>Since penning the foregoing, and at the last moment before being
                            compelled to close for the mail, I have had a third interview with Baron
                            Van Zuylen. He states that the instructions sent out in June were framed
                            purposely different from those of France, and excluded all reference to
                            vessels of war, solely because that course was deemed more favorable to
                            the United States government which had ships-of-war and no privateers.
                            You will remember that I called attention to this peculiarity at the
                            time.</p>
                        <p>In answer to my, inquiry whether he would not immediately adapt his
                            instructions to cover such cases as that of the Sumter, information of
                            which I was desirous to transmit by the next steamer, he replied that
                            the subject was now under consideration in the colonial department. He
                            insisted, however, that the governor of Curaçoa declared the vessel was
                            admitted on the ground of her being in distress, she having carried away
                            one of her masts, and that before admitting her he convoked his council,
                            who recommend the course he pursued.</p>
                        <p>I renewedly represented to Baron Van Zuylen the very grave character of
                            this question and its vital importance to the commerce of the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>Since the government here must by this time fully understand that our
                            government is very much in earnest on this subject, I entertain the hope
                            that they will hurry their deliberations to a favorable conclusion.</p>
                        <p>Allusion having been made on my part to the possible influence of
                            slaveholding sympathies in this case, I was pleased to be informed by
                            Baron Van Zuylen that the question of slavery had been finally
                            determined in Holland, and that emancipation is to take place in all the
                            Dutch colonies within two years.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, with great respect, your most obedient
                            servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your despatch of August 18, (No. 13,) has
                            been received, and the opinions it expresses seem to be just, while the
                            information it gives is very satisfactory. Treason is apt to mature its
                            energies before it strikes the first blow; on the other hand, loyalty is
                            unapprehensive of danger and usually waits for conviction of the
                            necessity for defence. The course of this domestic civil war illustrates
                            this maxim. The fortunes of the insurrection hang on immediate success
                            and despatch; efforts, therefore, are made to secure it. I feel sure, on
                            the contrary, that the government has been continually gaining strength
                            with every expenditure of vigor it has made. You will be gratified to
                            learn that the paper issued by the government is at par in the market
                            where gold and silver are recognized as the only lawful tender in the
                            payment of debts.</p>
                        <p>While you will not hold out inducements of rewards or bounties for
                            soldiers, you may say, whenever it shall seem expedient, that any
                            foreigners arriving in this country will probably find no difficulty in
                            finding military employment.</p>
                        <p>With a high appreciation of your discretion and vigilance, I am, sir,

                            <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I do not understand this government
                                to have yet distinctly conceded ‘belligerent rights’ to the
                                self-styled Confederate States.</p>
                            <p>“In behalf of my government I beg to say that I trust Holland will
                                not take this position now, and open the questions to flow
                                therefrom. By doing so, this government may make an enemy of the
                                United States, through the consequences growing out of that act. But
                                Holland will not thereby make a friend of the rash and misguided men
                                who lead the rebellion against the American government. For their
                                object is to perpetuate and extend African slavery. With this object
                                Holland can have no sympathy. Tour government has just now
                                determined to abolish that remnant of barbarism in your colonial
                                possessions.</p>
                            <p>“The slaveholders’ rebellion cannot be successful. The United States
                                has determined it shall not be, and that it will preserve the union
                                of the States at whatever cost.</p>
                            <p>“But even if we admit, for argument’s sake, that some of the
                                slaveholding States should be allowed hereafter to depart from the
                                Union, still would the rebellion be unsuccessful in its objects, and
                                hospitality shown to its progress be unavailing. The United States
                                would be still resolute to defeat the purposes of the rebel
                                slaveholder. They would do this by their own unaided efforts. They
                                might readily co-operate with foreign powers to the same end. Such
                                of those powers as hold possessions in America, wherein slavery has
                                been abolished, would join in this object from motives of justice
                                and humanity, as well as from considerations of policy and
                                consistency. Those who have colonies where the practice still
                                prevails would gladly concur in self-defence. England having
                                abolished slavery, France having put it under her feet, the position
                                of these two great maritime powers on this subject is fixed. The
                                recent action of the French Emperor is conclusive as to the policy
                                of that powerful monarchy. Spain, in her late trespass upon St.
                                Domingo, has been constrained to formally stipulate that she will
                                not reintroduce slavery in that island; Mexico and Central America
                                will be only too eager to enter into stipulations that shall save
                                them from any attempted spoliation, and preserve the condition of
                                freedom from slavery for all their inhabitants now and hereafter. A
                                common civilization throughout the world will look with favor on a
                                common union to crush the offensive purposes of the rebellious
                                slaveholder. His success, therefore, is out of the question. Unless
                                the world is to go backward, and history reverse its lessons, this
                                rebellion in its leading purpose is foredoomed. Even governments
                                cannot save that against which humanity revolts. Surrounded by
                                communities on the north, on the south, on the west, that have
                                expelled slavery; the islands of the Caribbean sea nearly all
                                emancipated from this pestilent system; the fabric of the rebellious
                                slaveholder, which he is so madly ambitious to erect, were even its
                                temporary establishment possible, would soon be washed away by the
                                attrition of surrounding influence upon its crumbling foundations,
                                and its remains left a ruin in the world.</p>
                            <p>“It is thus neither just nor politic, in any point of view, for the
                                powers of Europe to do anything to encourage this abortive and
                                criminal enterprise of the rebellious American slaveholder. For
                                though they should do ever so much, the effort will be none the less
                                abortive, through the operation of forces that governments cannot
                                control.</p>
                            <p>“The recognition of ‘belligerent rights’ to the party in question by
                                England and France was a precipitate and unnecessary act. It was
                                surely time enough to do this when the alternative presented an
                                embarrassing situation.</p>
                            <p>“The Dutch government has been wiser. In continuing to occupy the
                                position of refusing all countenance to the authors of such a
                                hateful rebellion, <pb n="364" xml:id="pg_364" facs="0364"/> the
                                Netherlands will do an act which will be viewed with the liveliest
                                satisfaction by the United States, and, I may be permitted to add,
                                one worthy the traditions of this ancient and renowned state, and
                                will set an example well worthy the respect and consideration of
                                other nations.</p>
                            <p>“The undersigned, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>
                            <p>“Baron <hi rend="smallcaps">Van Zuylen</hi>, <hi rend="italic"
                                    >&amp;c., &amp;c.</hi>”</p>
                            <p>On the 9th instant I had an interview with Baron Van Zuylen, again
                                urging him in the most earnest manner to issue such instructions to
                                the Dutch authorities in the West Indies as would peremptorily
                                exclude from their ports every species of craft set afloat by the
                                secessionists.</p>
                            <p>Baron Van Zuylen appears, and I have no doubt is, very desirous to do
                                all he possibly can, under what he deems the requirements of public
                                law, to carry out the wishes of the United States in this matter. He
                                does not consider that his government has recognized belligerent
                                rights, and desires not to be pressed on that point. I told him we
                                had no desire to press him to do anything, except to issue such
                                instructions to his colonial governors as will effectually exclude
                                the piratical vessels of the secessionists from making use of the
                                Dutch ports.</p>
                            <p>He asked then if we would consent to have our own ships-of-war
                                excluded. I told him if that was necessary to relieve him from a
                                dilemma, I did not know how far such an act might be tolerated for
                                the sake of an advantage which we could procure in no other way. We
                                might not find fault, if thereby we found our interests advanced.
                                But, of course, I could not undertake to commit my government on the
                                point. I remarked that exclusion would not operate to our
                                disadvantage, inasmuch as we had command of the sea, while it would
                                be fatal to the plunderers, as they had no retreat at home. He
                                intimated that his government contemplated making the proposition to
                                the United States. He also remarked that the course of our own
                                government threw impediments in their way; for while we regarded the
                                secessionists as rebels, we did not seem to treat them as such when
                                taken prisoners, not even their privateers. I concluded the
                                interview by renewedly urging every consideration I could adduce to
                                induce him to issue the desired orders, and to lose no time in doing
                                it.</p>
                            <p>He will soon make a written communication on the whole subject, which
                                I will forward at the earliest moment after receiving it.</p>
                            <p>After my interview, I addressed Baron Van Zuylen the following

                            <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to our conversation of
                                to-day, I beg to suggest that what appears to you a practical
                                difficulty may, it seems to me, be properly overcome by your

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to enclose the
                            communication from the Dutch government in reference to the Sumter case.
                            Though dated the 17th, it did not make its appearance to me till the
                            20th.</p>
                        <p>You will perceive that the ground taken in regard to the harboring of the
                            Sumter in the port of Curaçoa is, that it was the case of a vessel in
                            distress.</p>
                        <p>This paper, however, goes beyond the case in hand, and argues the claim
                            of the seceding States to be considered belligerents, and their rights
                            as such, besides going over the whole ground of the rights of
                            neutrals.</p>
                        <pb n="366" xml:id="pg_366" facs="0366"/>
                        <p>Baron Van Zuylen makes out to his own satisfaction that the secessionists
                            hold that position, and that this carries with it the right of
                            hospitality, in neutral ports, to their ships-of-war.</p>
                        <p>To my suggestion in my note of the 9th, that the Sumter was in no just
                            sense a ship-of-war, but a privateer, or, as our government claims, a
                            pirate, and that the want of the ordinary characteristics of a
                            ship-of-war, besides the fact that she bore a strange flag of no
                            recognized nationality, entitled us to ask of Holland, as a friendly
                            nation, to <hi rend="italic">assume</hi> her unlawful character. Mr. Van
                            Zuylen opposes an argument to show that the Sumter was really a
                            ship-of-war of the Confederate States, and that an impartial neutrality
                            demanded that she be so treated. He finds his support of his position
                            that this was the Sumter’s real character in the declarations of her
                            captain and in the allegation of <hi rend="italic">Harpers’
                            Weekly</hi>.</p>
                        <p>The minister of foreign affairs seems to admit the force of the argument
                            I had previously urged, that it was inconsistent with all ideas of a
                            just neutrality that these marauding vessels of the secessionists could
                            be allowed to make free use of the neighboring ports of a power holding
                            friendly relations with the United States, for hostile purposes, and
                            this, too, while deprived of all shelter or resource at home. And, in
                            reply to my earnest request that he would cause to be issued to the
                            Dutch colonial authorities in the West Indies orders against such use of
                            their ports, Baron Nan Zuylen de Nijevelt declares, under cover of his
                            general principles, that orders shall be issued in the sense of
                            forbidding the use of the Dutch ports as the base of operations against
                            United States commerce, or, as he phrases it, by either of the
                            belligerents.</p>
                        <p>In regard to this part of Mr. Van Zuylen’s communication, I will here
                            observe that much will depend upon the character of these instructions,
                            and not less upon the spirit in which they are executed. It is in the
                            power of the Dutch government, and of its colonial authorities, to so
                            act, upon the basis of the rule laid down on this head, as to avoid
                            further cause of complaint on the part of the United States, and to
                            effectually prevent these sea robbers from making use of the Dutch ports
                            as a means of pursuing their ravages; and I have so expressed myself to
                            Baron Van Zuylen in the note of which I have the honor to annex a copy.
                            I will add that I have confidence that such orders will be given.</p>

                            <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have had the honor to receive your
                                communication of the 17th instant, which will, in due time, receive
                                that attention its importance merits.</p>
                            <p>“Meantime I desire to observe that, as must have been obvious to you,
                                I have hitherto contented myself with advancing general
                                considerations appealing to the friendly dispositions of Holland,
                                rather than in invoking the application of the strict rules of
                                public law to the case under review.</p>
                            <p>“The Dutch government exercises its undoubted right in overlooking
                                such considerations, and in assuming the championship of a so-called
                                neutrality, which insists upon treating a domestic disturbance as a
                                war between equals.</p>
                            <p>“For those who so desire, as I am sure Holland does not, it is easy
                                to be persuaded of an incipient nationality in an insurrection, and
                                to see a ship-of-war in every pirate that insults mankind with her
                                depredations or shocks it with her crimes.</p>
                            <p>“I have great satisfaction in learning from his communication that
                                Baron Van Zuylen recognizes the force of the considerations I have
                                had the honor <pb n="367" xml:id="pg_367" facs="0367"/> to present
                                to him touching the evident violation of a just neutrality which is
                                involved in the free use of the ports of the Netherlands by the

                                commerce and shipping of the United States, and also in learning
                                that the government of his Majesty has determined that it will not
                                permit its ports to be made the base of operations against that
                                commerce, and that instructions in this sense will be addressed to
                                the governors of the Netherlands colonial possessions.</p>
                            <p>“It is in the power of the Dutch government, acting upon the rule it
                                has thus laid down, to issue such instructions to its colonial
                                authorities as shall prevent further cause of complaint on the part
                                of the United States, if those instructions shall be executed in
                                good faith.</p>
                            <p>“The United States government will rely upon the action of Holland in
                                this respect, and will still confidently look for such a course on
                                the part of the Dutch government as will aid it in driving the
                                instigators of rebellion and plunderers of property upon the high

                                    <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I shall to-day forward your
                                        communication of the 17th instant to my government. I do it
                                        with reluctance, since its basis is found, as I have already
                                        remarked to you, in the assumption of the government of the
                                        Netherlands that the domestic disturbance in the United
                                        States is a war between equals.</p>
                                    <p>“It cannot be supposed that the United States will consent to
                                        debate the question of an abridgment of their sovereignty
                                        with Holland or any other nation.</p>
                                    <p>“The United States are one whole undivided nation, especially
                                        so far as foreign nations are concerned, and Holland is, by
                                        the law of nations and by treaties, not a neutral power
                                        between two imaginary parties there, but a friend of the
                                        United States. There is in the United States, as there has
                                        always been since the establishment of the government, one
                                        political power, namely, the United States of America,
                                        competent to make war and peace, and conduct alliances and
                                        commerce with foreign nations. There is none other, either
                                        in fact, or recognized by foreign nations. There is, indeed,
                                        an armed sedition seeking to overthrow the government, and
                                        the government is employing military and naval force to
                                        suppress it. But these facts do not constitute a war
                                        presenting two belligerent powers, and modifying the
                                        national character, rights, and responsibilities, or the
                                        character, rights, and responsibilities of foreign
                                        nations.</p>
                                    <p>“That Holland should take a different view of the case will,
                                        I am sure, be a subject of very deep regret to the United
                                        States.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The department of the colonies has
                                just communicated to me the information, transmitted by the governor
                                of Curaçoa, concerning the affair of the ship “Sumter,” and I hasten
                                to bring to your notice the following observations, by way of
                                sequence to the preliminary reply which I had the honor to address
                                to you on the 2d of this month. According to the principles of the
                                law of nations, all nations without exception may admit vessels of
                                war belonging to a belligerent State to their ports, and accord to
                                them all the favors which constitute an asylum. Conditions are
                                imposed on said vessels during their stay in the port or roadstead.
                                For example, they must keep perfect peace with all vessels that may
                                be there; they may not augment their crews, nor the number of their
                                guns, nor be on the lookout in the ports or roadsteads for the
                                purpose of watching after hostile vessels arriving or departing,
                                &amp;c. Besides, every state has the right to interdict foreign
                                vessels of war from entrance to ports which are purely military.
                                Thus it was that Sweden and Denmark, in 1854, at the time of the
                                Crimean war, reserved the right to exclude vessels of war from such
                                or such ports of their dominions.</p>
                            <p>The neutral power has also the right to act like France, who, by her
                                declaration of neutrality in the war between the United States and
                                the Confederate States, under date of 9th June last, (Moniteur of
                                11th June,) does not permit any vessel of war, or privateer, of one
                                or the other of the belligerents, to enter and remain with their
                                prizes in French ports longer than twenty-four hours, unless in case
                                of refuge under stress.</p>
                            <p>In the proclamation of the month of June last, which was communicated
                                to you with my despatch of the 13th, the government of the
                                Netherlands has not excluded vessels of war from her ports.</p>
                            <p>As to privateers, the greatest number of the maritime nations allows
                                them the privilege of asylum upon the same conditions nearly as to
                                vessels of war.</p>
                            <p>According to a highly-esteemed author on the law of nations,
                                (Haute-feuille, Droits et Devoirs des Nations Neutres, I, p. 139,)
                                privateers may claim entrance into the ports of nations which have
                                consented to accord asylum to them, not only in cases of pressing
                                dangers, but even in cases in which they may deem it advantageous,
                                or even only agreeable, and for obtaining rest or articles of
                                secondary necessity, such as the refreshments they may have need
                                of.</p>
                            <p>The terms of the proclamation of the Netherlands government, which
                                admits privateers into Netherlands ports only in cases of distress,
                                harmonize with this doctrine.</p>
                            <p>Moreover, according to the information received from the governor of
                                Curaçoa, the “Sumter” was actually in distress, and that functionary
                                could not, therefore, refuse to allow the said vessel to enter the
                                port.</p>
                            <p>Strong in its amicable intentions, the King’s government does not
                                believe itself bound to confine itself to the defence of the conduct
                                of one of its agents in the particular case under discussion. It is
                                not ignorant that it can or may hereafter be a contested question in
                                such cases as to the reality of the distress in which such vessel or
                                other would be, and that thus the subject of the admission generally
                                of the Confederate States vessels would rest untouched. I,
                                therefore, sir, think it opportune to look into the question <pb
                                    n="369" xml:id="pg_369" facs="0369"/> to determine whether the
                                Sumter should have been admitted at Curaçoa outside of the condition
                                of well-assured distress.</p>
                            <p>It is evident that the reply to be made is dependent on another
                                question—that is to say, was this vessel a man-of-war or a
                                privateer?</p>
                            <p>In the latter case, the Netherlands government could not, except in
                                case of a putting in compelled by distress, (relâche forcée,) admit
                                the Sumter into the ports of its territories.</p>
                            <p>It is not sufficient to dispose of the difficulty by the declaration
                                that the Sumter is, as is stated in your despatches, “a vessel
                                fitted out for, and actually engaged in, piratical expeditions,” or
                                “a privateer steamer.” Such an assertion should be clearly proved,
                                in accordance with the rule of law, “<hi rend="italic">affirmanti
                                    incumbit probatio</hi>.”</p>
                            <p>After having poised, with all the attention which comports with the
                                weightiness of the matter, the facts and circumstances which
                                characterize the dissensions which now are laying desolate the
                                United States, and of which no government more desires the prompt
                                termination than does that of the Netherlands, I think I may express
                                the conviction that the Sumter is not a privateer, but a
                                man-of-war—grounding myself on the following considerations:</p>
                            <p>In the first place, the declaration of the commander of the vessel
                                given in writing to the governor of Curaçoa, who had made known that
                                he would not allow a privateer to come into the port, and had then
                                demanded explanations as to the character of the vessel. This
                                declaration purported “the Sumter is a ship-of-war duly commissioned
                                by the government of the Confederate States.”</p>
                            <p>The Netherlands governor had to be contented with the word of the
                                commander couched in writing. Mr. Ortolan, (Diplomatic de la Mer, I,
                                p. 217,) in speaking of the evidence of nationality of vessels of
                                war, thus expresses himself:</p>
                            <p>“The flag and the pennant are visible indications, but we are not
                                bound to give faith to them until they are sustained by a cannot
                                shot.”</p>
                            <p>The attestation of the commander may be exigible, but other proofs
                                must be presumed; and, whether on the high seas or elsewhere, no
                                foreign power has the right to obtain the exhibition of them.</p>
                            <p>Therefore the colonial council has unanimously concluded that the
                                word of the commanding officer was sufficient.</p>
                            <p>In the second place, the vessel armed for war by <hi rend="italic"
                                    >private persons</hi> is called “privateer.” The character of
                                such vessel is settled precisely, and, like her English name,
                                (privateer,) indicates sufficiently under this circumstance that she
                                is a <hi rend="italic">private</hi> armed vessel—name which Mr.
                                Wheaton gives them.— (Elements of International Law, II, p. 19.)</p>
                            <p>Privateering is the maritime warfare which privateers are authorized
                                to make, <hi rend="italic">for their own account</hi>, against
                                merchant vessels of the enemy by virtue of letters of marque which
                                are issued to them by the State.</p>
                            <p>The Sumter is not a private vessel; is not the private property of
                                unconnected individuals—of private ship-owners. She, therefore,
                                cannot be a privateer; she can only be a ship-of-war or ship of the
                                State armed for cruising. Thus the Sumter is designated, in the
                                extract annexed from “Harpers’ Weekly,” under the name of “rebel
                                ship-of-war.”</p>
                            <p>Thirdly. It cannot be held, as you propose in your despatch of the
                                9th of this month, that all vessels carrying the confederate flag
                                are, without distinction, to be considered as privateers, because
                                the principles of the law of nations, as well as the examples of
                                history, require that the rights of war be accorded to those
                                States.</p>
                            <p>The government of the United States holds that it should consider the
                                States of the south as rebels.</p>
                            <pb n="370" xml:id="pg_370" facs="0370"/>
                            <p>It does not pertain to the King’s government to pronounce upon the
                                subject of a question which is entirely within the domain of the
                                internal regulation of the United States; neither has it to inquire
                                whether, in virtue of the Constitution which rules that republic,
                                the States of the south can separate from the central government,
                                and whether they ought then, aye or no, to be reputed as rebels
                                during the first period of the difficulties.</p>
                            <p>But I deem it my duty to observe to you, sir, that, according to the
                                doctrines of the best publicists, such as Vattel, III, c. 18, § 292,
                                and Mr. de Rayneval, Droit de la Nation et des Gens, I, p. 161,
                                there is a notable difference between rebellion and civil war.
                                “When,” says Vattel, “a party is formed in the state, which no
                                longer obeys its sovereign, and is strong enough to make head
                                against him, or in a republic, when the nation divides into two
                                opposing parties, and on one side and the other take up arms, then
                                it is civil war.” It is, therefore, the latter which now agitates
                                the great American republic.</p>
                            <p>But, in this case, the rights of war must be accorded to the two
                                parties.</p>
                            <p>Let me be allowed to cite here only two passages; the one from
                                Vattel, (II, c. 4, § 56,) which reads: “Whenever affairs reach to
                                civil war the ties of political association are broken, or at least
                                suspended, between the sovereign and his people. They may be
                                considered as two distinct powers; and, since one and the other are
                                independent of any foreign authority, no one has the right to judge
                                between them. Each of them may be right. It follows, then, that the
                                two parties may act as having equal right.” The other passage is
                                taken from the work of a former minister, himself belonging to the
                                United States, Mr. Wheaton, who, in his Elements of International
                                Law, c. I, p. 35, (Am. ed., part 1, p. 32,) thus expresses himself:
                                “If the foreign state would observe absolute neutrality in the face
                                of dissensions which disturb another state, it must accord to both
                                belligerent parties all the rights which war accords to public
                                enemies, such as the right of blockade, and the right of
                                intercepting merchandise contraband of war.”</p>
                            <p>As for historic evidence, it will suffice to call to mind from
                                ancient times the struggle of the United Provinces with Spain, and
                                from modern date the war between the Hispano-American colonies and
                                the mother country since 1810, the war of independence of Greece
                                from Turkey since 1821, &amp;c.</p>
                            <p>It will doubtless be useless to recollect, on this occasion, that the
                                principle to see only insurgents in the States of the south, having
                                neither sovereignty nor rights of war, nor of peace, was put forward
                                by England, at the breaking out of the war of independence of the
                                Anglo-American colonies, in the vindicatory memoir published by the
                                British court in 1778 in answer to the exposition of the motives for
                                the conduct of France, which had lately signed, on the 6th day of
                                February of that year, a treaty with the United States, in which
                                they were regarded as an independent nation.</p>
                            <p>But the court of Versailles set out from other principles, which she
                                developed in “Observations on the Vindicatory Memoir of the Court of
                                London,” saying, among other things: “It is sufficient to the
                                justification of his Majesty that the colonies had established their
                                independence not merely by a solemn declaration, but also in fact,
                                and had maintained it against the efforts of the mother
                                country.”</p>
                            <p>Existing circumstances seem to present the same characteristics; and
                                if it is desired to treat the States of the south as rebels, and
                                accuse them of felony, there might here be cited as applicable to
                                the actual conduct of the United States towards the confederates the
                                following remark of the court of Versailles: “In advancing this
                                proposition, (that the possession of independence, of which the
                                French cabinet said the Americans were in the enjoyment in 1778, was
                                a veritable felony,) the English minister had, without doubt,
                                forgotten the course he had himself taken towards the Americans <pb
                                    n="371" xml:id="pg_371" facs="0371"/> from the publication of
                                the declaration of independence. It is remembered that the creatures
                                of the court constantly called upon the rebellion vengeance and
                                destruction. However, notwithstanding all their clamors, the English
                                minister abstained, after the declaration of independence, from
                                prosecuting the Americans as rebels; he observed, and still observes
                                towards them, the rules of war usual among independent nations.
                                American prisoners have been exchanged through cartels,” &amp;c.</p>
                            <p>The rights of war cannot, then, in the opinion of the King’s
                                government, be refused to the Confederate States; but I hasten to
                                add that the recognition of these rights does not import in favor of
                                such States recognition of their sovereignty.</p>
                            <p>“Foreign nations,” says Mr. Martens, (Précis du Droit des Gens, 1.
                                VIII, c. 3, § 264,) “cannot refuse to consider as lawful enemies
                                those who are empowered by their actual government, whatever that
                                may be. <hi rend="italic">This is not recognition of its
                                    legitimacy</hi>.”</p>
                            <p>This last recognition can only spring from express and official
                                declaration, which no one of the cabinets of Europe has thus far
                                made.</p>
                            <p>Finally, and in the last place, I permit myself here to cite the
                                example of the American privateer Paul Jones.</p>
                            <p>This vessel, considered as a pirate by England, had captured two of
                                his Britannic Majesty’s ships in October, 1779. She took them into
                                the Texel, and remained there more than two months, notwithstanding
                                the representations Mr. York, ambassador of Great Britain at the
                                Hague, who considered the asylum accorded to such privateer (pirate
                                as he called it in his memoir to the states general of 21st March,
                                1780) as directly contrary to treaties, and even to the ordinances
                                of the government of the republic.</p>
                            <p>Mr. York demanded that the English vessels should be released.</p>
                            <p>The states general refused the restitution of the prizes.</p>
                            <p>The United States, whose belligerent rights were not recognized by
                                England, enjoyed at that period the same treatment in the ports of
                                the republic of the United Provinces as the Netherlands authorities
                                have now accorded to the Confederate States.</p>
                            <p>If the cabinet of the Hague cannot, therefore, by force of the
                                preceding, class all the vessels of the Confederate States-armed for
                                war in the category of privateers, much less can it treat them as
                                pirates, (as you call them in your despatch of the 12th of this
                                month,) or consider the Sumter as engaged in a filibustering
                                expedition—“engaged in a piratical expedition against the commerce
                                of the United States”—as it reads in your communication of the 2d of
                                September.</p>
                            <p>Here again historic antecedents militate in favor of the opinion of
                                the Netherlands government.</p>
                            <p>Is there need, in fact, to remind you that at the outset of the war
                                of American independence, in 1778, the English refused to recognize
                                American privateers as lawful enemies, under the pretence that the
                                letters of marque which they bore did not emanate from the
                                sovereign, but from revolted subjects?</p>
                            <p>But Great Britain soon had to desist from this pretension, and to
                                accord international treatment to the colonists in arms against the
                                mother country.</p>
                            <p>The frankness with which the King’s government has expressed its
                                convictions in relation to the course to be taken towards the States
                                of the south will, without doubt, be estimated at its just value by
                                the government of the United States.</p>
                            <p>It will perceive therein the well-settled intention to preserve in
                                safety the rights of neutrality; to lay down for itself and to
                                follow a line of conduct equally distant from feebleness as from too
                                great adventurousness, but suitable for maintaining intact the
                                dignity of the state.</p>
                            <p>The government of the Netherlands desires to observe, on the occasion
                                of <pb n="372" xml:id="pg_372" facs="0372"/> existing affairs in
                                America, a perfect and absolute neutrality, and to abstain therefore
                                from the slightest act of partiality.</p>
                            <p>According to Hubner, (Saisie de Bâtiments Neutres,) “neutrality
                                consists in absolute inaction relative to war, and in exact and
                                perfect impartiality manifested by facts in regard to the
                                belligerents, as far as this impartiality has relation to the war,
                                and to the direct and immediate measures for its prosecution.”</p>
                            <p>“Neutrality,” says Azuni, (Droits Maritimes,) “is the continuation in
                                a state of peace of a power which, when war is kindled between two
                                or more nations, absolutely abstains from taking any part in the
                                contest.”</p>
                            <p>But if the proposition be admitted that all the vessels of the
                                Confederate States armed for war should be considered <hi
                                    rend="italic">prima facie</hi> as privateers, would there not be
                                a flagrant inequality between the treatment and the favors accorded
                                to vessels of war of the United States and the vessels of the
                                Confederate States, which have not for the moment a navy properly so
                                called?</p>
                            <p>This evidently would be giving proof of partiality incompatible with
                                real duties of neutrality. The only question is to determine with
                                exactitude the distinctive characteristics between a privateer and a
                                ship-of-war, although this may be difficult of execution. Thus is
                                ignored that which Count Reventlon, envoy of the King of Denmark at
                                Madrid, drew attention to in 1782, that there exists among the
                                maritime powers regulations or conventions between sovereigns, which
                                oblige them to equip their vessels in a certain manner, that they
                                may be held veritably armed for war.</p>
                            <p>You express also, in your despatch of September 2, the hope that the
                                Netherlands government will do justice to your reclamation,
                                grounding yourself on the tenor of treaties existing between the
                                Netherlands and the United States, on the principles of the law of
                                nations, and, finally, upon the assurances you have received from
                                the King’s government.</p>
                            <p>Amidst all the European powers there are few who have better defended
                                the rights of neutrals, and have suffered more in this noble cause
                                than Denmark; and one of her greatest statesmen of the close of the
                                last century, Count Bernstorff, has been able to declare with
                                justice, in his memoir of July 28, 1793, a document that will long
                                continue to be celebrated: “A neutral power fulfils all its duties
                                by never departing from the most strict impartiality, nor from the
                                avowed meaning of its treaties.”</p>
                            <p>I have endeavored, sir, to show, in what precedes, that the
                                government of the Netherlands has fulfilled conscientiously its
                                first duty, and will adhere faithfully thereto.</p>
                            <p>The cabinet of the Hague does not observe and will not observe less
                                religiously the tenor of treaties.</p>
                            <p>The treaty of the 19th of January, 1839, and the additional
                                convention of the 26th of August, 1852, only relate to commerce and
                                navigation; the only treaties that can be invoked in the present
                                case are those of the 8th of October, 1782.</p>
                            <p>I do not think it my duty to enter here upon a discussion of
                                principles on the question of deciding whether these treaties can
                                still be considered as actually in force, and I will not take
                                advantage of the circumstance that the cabinet of Washington has
                                implicitly recognized, by the very reclamation which is the object
                                of your despatches, that the treaties of 1782 cannot any longer be
                                invoked as the basis of international relations between the
                                Netherlands and the United States.</p>
                            <p>I will only take the liberty of observing to you, sir, that the
                                execution of the stipulations included in those diplomatic acts
                                would be far, in the present circumstances, from being favorable to
                                the government of the republic.</p>
                            <p>In fact, we should, in this case, admit to our ports privateers with
                                their <pb n="373" xml:id="pg_373" facs="0373"/> prizes, which could
                                even be sold there by virtue of article 5 of the before-cited
                                convention of 1782, on rescues.</p>
                            <p>It would, perhaps, be objected that the treaty of 1782, having been
                                concluded with the United States of America, could not be invoked by
                                a part of the Union which had seceded from the central government,
                                and I do not dissent from the opinion that this thorny question of
                                public law would give rise, should the case occur, to very serious
                                difficulties.</p>
                            <p>But we cannot lose sight of the fact that the treaty spoken of was
                                concluded, even before the recognition of the United States by
                                England in 1783, with the oldest members of the republic, among
                                others, to wit, with Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and
                                Georgia, and that those States actually figure among the
                                secessionists.</p>
                            <p>In 1782 the republic of North America was only a simple confederation
                                of states, remaining sovereign, united only for common defence,
                                (Staatenbund) and it is only since the establishment of the
                                Constitution, of the 17th of September, 1787, that the pact which
                                binds together the United States received the character which is
                                attributed to it by Mr. Wheaton, also, (Elements of International
                                Law,) of a perfect union between all the members as one people under
                                one government, federal and supreme, (Bundestaat,) “a commonwealth,”
                                according to Mr. Motley in his pamphlet “Causes of the Civil War in
                                America,” p. 71.</p>
                            <p>In view of this fundamental difference between the present character
                                of the government of the United States and that of the party
                                contracting the treaty of 1782, it would be difficult to refuse in
                                equity the privilege of the secessionist States to avail themselves
                                of it.</p>
                            <p>It will, therefore, not escape your penetration that it is
                                preferable, as well for the Netherlands as for the cabinet of
                                Washington, to leave the treaty above mentioned at rest, and that,
                                in excluding privateers from its ports the government of the
                                Netherlands has acted only in the interests of the government of the
                                United States, to which it is bound by feelings of a friendship
                                which dates even from the time of the existence of the republic of
                                the united provinces, and which the King’s government will make
                                every effort to maintain and consolidate more and more.</p>
                            <p>According to the law of nations, the cases in which the neutrality of
                                a power is more advantageous to one party than to the other do not
                                affect or impair it; it suffices that the neutrality be perfect and
                                strictly observed. The government of the Netherlands has not
                                departed from it, therefore, in denying admission to the ports of
                                his Majesty’s territories to privateers, although at first glance
                                this determination is unfavorable to the southern States.</p>
                            <p>The difficulties which have actually arisen, and which may be renewed
                                hereafter, the desire to avoid as much as possible everything that
                                could compromise the good understanding between the governments of
                                the United States and the Netherlands, impose on the last the
                                obligation to examine with scrupulous attention if the maintenance
                                of the general principles which I have had the honor to develop
                                might not in some particular cases impair the attitude of neutrality
                                which the cabinet of the Hague desires to observe. If, for example,
                                we had room to believe that the Sumter, or any other vessel of one
                                of the two belligerent parties, sought to make of Curaçoa, or any
                                other port in his Majesty’s dominions, the base of operations
                                against the commerce of the adverse party, the government of the
                                Netherlands would be the first to perceive that such acts would be a
                                real infraction, not merely of the neutrality we wish to observe,
                                but also of the right of sovereignty over the territorial seas of
                                the state; the duty of a neutral state being to take care that
                                vessels of the belligerent parties commit no acts of hostility <pb
                                    n="374" xml:id="pg_374" facs="0374"/> within the limits of its
                                territory, and do not keep watch in the ports of its dominion to
                                course from them after vessels of the adverse party.</p>
                            <p>Instructions on this point will be addressed to the governors of the
                                Netherlands colonial possessions.</p>
                            <p>I flatter myself that the preceding explanations will suffice to
                                convince the federal government of the unchangeable desire of that
                                of the Netherlands to maintain a strict neutrality, and will cause
                                the disappearance of the slightest trace of misunderstanding between
                                the cabinets of the Hague and of Washington.</p>
                            <p>Accept, sir, the renewed assurance of my high consideration.</p>

                            the steamer. It is only just now that I have received your despatch of
                            September 4, (No. 15.) The proceeding at Curaçoa in regard to the Sumter
                            was so extraordinary, and so entirely contrary to what this government
                            had expected from that of Holland, that I lose no time in instructing
                            you to urge the consideration of the subject with as much earnestness as
                            possible. I cannot believe that that government will hesitate to disavow
                            the conduct of the authorities if they have been correctly reported to

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I am just now informed by a despatch from
                            Henry Sawyer, esq., our consul at Paramaribo, that on the 19th day of
                            August last the piratical steamer “Sumter” entered that port, and was
                            allowed by the authorities there to approach the town and to purchase
                            and receive coals, to stay during her pleasure, and to retire
                            unmolested, all of which was done in opposition to the remonstrances of
                            the consul.</p>
                        <p>You will lose no time in soliciting the attention of his Majesty’s
                            government to this violation of the rights of the United States. They
                            will be well aware that it is the second instance of the same kind that
                            has occurred in regard to the same vessel in Dutch colonies in the West
                            Indies.</p>
                        <p>It is some relief of the sense of injury which we feel that we do not
                            certainly know that the authorities who have permitted these wrongs had
                            received instructions from their home government in regard to the rights
                            of the United States in the present emergency. We therefore hope for
                            satisfactory explanations. But, in any case, you will inform that
                            government that the United States will expect them to visit those
                            authorities with a censure so unreserved as will prevent the repetition
                            of such injuries hereafter. <pb n="375" xml:id="pg_375" facs="0375"/> An
                            early resolution of the subject is imperatively necessary, in order that
                            this government may determine what is required for the protection of its
                            national rights in the Dutch American forts.</p>
                        <p>I am, sir, respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

                                        date of the 4th of September last, which I lose no time in
                                        laying before your excellency.</p>
                                    <p>“The consul states.”</p>
                                    <p rend="center">[See above.]</p>
                                    <p>“The reappearance of the Sumter in a port of the Netherlands,
                                        after so brief an interval, seems to disclose a deliberate
                                        purpose on the part of the persons engaged in rebellion
                                        against the United States government to practice upon the
                                        presumed indifference, the expected favor, or the fancied
                                        weakness of the Dutch government.</p>
                                    <p>“During a period of forty-six days, during which we have
                                        heard of this piratical vessel in the West Indies, it would
                                        appear that she had been twice entertained and supplied at
                                        Dutch ports, and spent eighteen days under their
                                        shelter.</p>
                                    <p>“This can be no accidental circumstance.</p>
                                    <p>“In the multitude of harbors with which the West India seas
                                        abound, the Sumter has had no occasion to confine her visits
                                        so entirely to the ports of one nation, especially one so
                                        scantily supplied with them as Holland. And the fact that
                                        she does so is, in my judgment, not fairly susceptible of
                                        any other interpretation than the one I have given.</p>
                                    <p>“I feel convinced that the government of the Netherlands will
                                        see in this repeated visit of the Sumter (this time, it
                                        appears, without any pretext) a distinct violation of its
                                        neutrality according to its own views, as laid down <pb
                                            n="376" xml:id="pg_376" facs="0376"/> in your
                                        excellency’s communication to me of the 17th of September
                                        last, and a case which will call for the energetic assertion
                                        of its purpose expressed in the paper referred to, namely,
                                        not to allow its ports to be made the base of hostile
                                        operations against the United States. For that the Sumter is
                                        clearly making such use of the Dutch ports would seem to
                                        admit of no controversy.</p>
                                    <p>“In view of the existing state of the correspondence between
                                        the United States and the Netherlands on the general subject
                                        to which this case belongs, and of the questions and
                                        relations involved therein, I shall be excused for the
                                        brevity of this communication upon a topic of so much
                                        importance and so provocative of comment.</p>
                                    <p>“The undersigned avails himself,” &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>
                                    <p>I called to-day upon Baron Von Zuylen, but he was absent, and
                                        I shall not therefore be able to see him again before the
                                        close of the mail which takes this. And I do not know that
                                        an interview would in any way affect the existing state of
                                        things or give me any new information. This government’s
                                        intentions are good; and it desires to avoid all difficulty
                                        with the United States, and with everybody else.</p>
                                    <p>As I stated in my despatch of the 25th September, I have
                                        confidence that orders have been given that will impede the
                                        operations of these vessels in Dutch ports hereafter, and
                                        probably drive them elsewhere.</p>
                                    <p>I have the honor to be, with great respect, your most
                                        obedient servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: After reflection, upon the reappearance of
                            the Sumter, and her prolonged stay in the port of Paramaribo, (this time
                            apparently without pretext of any kind,) I have felt, in view of the
                            position taken by the Dutch <pb n="377" xml:id="pg_377" facs="0377"/>
                            government in their communication to me of the 17th of September, that
                            we were entitled to be specially informed of the precise interpretation
                            which this government puts upon their general declaration in the
                            communication referred to, namely, that it will not permit its ports to
                            be made the base of hostile operations against the United States
                            commerce.</p>
                        <p>I have accordingly made the direct inquiry of Baron Van Zuylen, without
                            waiting to hear what you have to say in response to that communication.
                            In reply to my inquiry, Baron Van Zuylen has informed me that, previous
                            to his receiving information of the appearance of the Sumter at
                            Paramaribo, orders were issued by the department of the colonies,
                            instructing the colonial authorities not to permit the repetition of the
                            visits of the Sumter, and other vessels of the so-called Confederate
                            States; and if they did make their appearance in Dutch ports, to require
                            them to leave within twenty-four hours, under penalty of being held to
                            occupy a hostile attitude towards the government of the Netherlands. And
                            further, that those authorities have also been instructed to forbid the
                            furnishing of such vessels with more than twenty-four hours supply of
                            fuel. These instructions, thus defined, are to the point. Whether they
                            have been made general, and with that disregard of distinctions between
                            the rights of mere belligerents and those of recognized nationalities,
                            enjoying pacific relations and acting under treaties of amity and
                            friendship, that mark the communication to which I have adverted, I did
                            not deem it pertinent to inquire, nor do I consider the inquiry of any
                            value as regards the practical bearings of this case.</p>
                        <p>In compliance with my request, Baron Van Zuylen has promised to furnish
                            me with a copy of the order referred to, which, when received, I shall
                            transmit to you without delay.</p>
                        <p>Although this order, as thus described to me by Mr. Van Zuylen, only
                            sustains the expectations I have expressed to you on two former
                            occasions as to what the action of this government would be, yet,
                            considering the present attitude of the question, it is a matter of some
                            surprise to me that a copy of it should not have been tendered without
                            waiting to have it asked for.</p>
                        <p rend="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
                        <p>Taking it to be as herein described, I do not see that the position of
                            this government, so far as its action is concerned, is amenable to very
                            grave censure, whatever may be said of its theoretic views, since the
                            Dutch ports are now, substantially, shut to the vessels. The restriction
                            in regard to supplying fuel, if adopted by other powers holding colonies
                            in the West Indies, will put an end to rebel operations by steam in
                            those seas.</p>
                        <p>I take some gratification in reflecting that my persistent appeals to the
                            government to issue specific orders, on some ground, to their colonial
                            authorities, looking to the exclusion of the piratical vessels of the
                            seceding States from the Dutch ports, have not been wholly unavailing.
                            That the government has argued against it, and declined acting on any
                            suggestion I could make, is of small consequence, so long as they have
                            found out a way of their own of doing the thing that was needed.</p>
                        <p>Baron Van Zuylen has renewedly expressed great regret that any questions
                            should have arisen between the two governments.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, with great respect, your most obedient
                            servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to enclose you the reply
                            of the minister of foreign affairs to the communication I addressed to
                            him on the 8th instant, in regard to the reappearance of the Sumter at
                            Paramaribo. He states therein the character of the orders which have
                            been sent to the colonial authorities, to which I referred in my last
                            despatch, of October 12, (No. 22.)</p>
                        <p>The British minister here, Sir Andrew Buchanan, expressed incredulity and
                            surprise when I informed him this government had issued the order in
                            question. He declared the British government would not do it, and that
                            the United States would not under similar circumstances. He said it was
                            giving us an advantage, and was not therefore neutral conduct. He added
                            that Russia asked Sweden to close her ports against both belligerents
                            during the Crimean war, and England would not permit it, alleging that
                            as Russia did not want to use them, and England did, it gave the former
                            an advantage to which that power was not entitled. The British
                            government held that Sweden, as a neutral, had no right to alter the
                            natural situation unless it operated equally.</p>
                        <p>You see herein how thoroughly English officials (and it seems to me all
                            others) are imbued with the idea that the rights of a mere belligerent
                            are the same as the rights of a nation, in cases like the one under
                            consideration.</p>
                        <p>I have received to-day a letter from our consul at Paramaribo, dated
                            September 20, in which he says the United States steamer Powhatan
                            arrived there on the 14th in search of the Sumter, and left for Brazil
                            the same day; also that the Keystone State arrived on the 18th on the
                            same errand, and left on the 19th for the West India islands.</p>
                        <p>Your despatch of the 28th of September, acknowledging receipt of mine of
                            the 4th, has arrived. As you make no mention of mine of the 11th, it
                            would seem another mail has missed. I wrote our despatch agent at London
                            on the subject several days ago.</p>
                        <p>He replies that my despatch of the 4th of September went on the 7th, and
                            that of the 11th on the 14th, which was in regular order.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, with great respect, your most obedient
                            servant,</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: By your despatch of the 8th of this
                                month you have fixed my attention, on the arrival of the “Sumter” at
                                Paramaribo, and you complain that on this occasion the said vessel
                                was admitted into ports of the Netherlands during eighteen days out
                                of the forty-six in which the Sumter had shown herself in the West
                                Indian seas.</p>
                            <p>You suppose that this is not a fortuitous case, and you demand that
                                the government of the Netherlands, in accordance with the intentions
                                mentioned at the close of my communication of the 17th September
                                last, may not permit <pb n="379" xml:id="pg_379" facs="0379"/> its
                                ports to serve as stations or as base of hostile operations against
                                the United States.</p>
                            <p>You have not deemed it your duty to enter for the moment on the
                                discussion of the arguments contained in my above-mentioned
                                communication, but you say that you wish to await preliminarily the
                                reply of the cabinet at Washington.</p>
                            <p>I may, therefore, on my part, confine myself for the moment to
                                referring, as to what regards the admission in general of the Sumter
                                into the ports of the Netherlands and the character of this vessel,
                                to the arguments contained in my communication of the 17th
                                September, from which it follows, that if we do not choose to
                                consider <hi rend="italic">prima facie</hi> all the ships of the
                                seceding States as privateers, and if, in the present case, the
                                Sumter could not be, in the opinion of the government of the
                                Netherlands, comprised among such, entrance to the ports of the
                                Netherlands cannot be prohibited to that vessel without a departure
                                from neutrality and from the express terms of the proclamation of
                                the royal government.</p>
                            <p>It has already been observed that the latter, in forbidding access to
                                the ports of the Netherlands to privateers, favors the United States
                                much more, among others, than the declaration of the 10th of June by
                                the French government, which, not permitting any vessel-of-war or
                                privateer of the one or the other of the belligerents to sojourn <hi
                                    rend="italic">with prizes</hi> in the ports of the empire for
                                longer time than twenty-four hours, except in case of shelter
                                through stress, (<hi rend="italic">relâche forcée</hi>,) admits them
                                without distinction when they do not bring prizes with them. But,
                                without entering here into useless developments, I think I may
                                observe to you, sir, that the royal government, whilst refusing to
                                treat as pirates, or even to consider as privateers, all the vessels
                                of the southern States, has striven, as much as the duties of strict
                                neutrality permit, to keep the Sumter away from our ports. When this
                                vessel arrived at Paramaribo, the commanders of two ships of the
                                French imperial marine, which were there at the time, declared to
                                the governor of Surinam that the Sumter was a regular vessel-of-war
                                and not a privateer. The commander of the Sumter exhibited
                                afterwards, to the same functionary, his commission as commandant in
                                a regular navy.</p>
                            <p>Although there was no reason, under such circumstances, to refuse to
                                the Sumter the enjoyment of the law of hospitality in all its
                                extent, the governor, before referred to, strove to limit it as much
                                as possible. Thus, although pit coal is not reputed contraband, if
                                not at most, and within a recent time only, contraband by accident,
                                it was not supplied to the Sumter except in the very restricted
                                quantity of 125 tons, at the most sufficient for four days’
                                progress.</p>
                            <p>However, the government of the Netherlands, wishing to give a fresh
                                proof of its desire [to avoid] all that could give the slightest
                                subject for complaint to the United States, has just sent
                                instructions to the colonial authorities, enjoining them not to
                                admit, except in case of shelter from stress, (<hi rend="italic"
                                    >relâche forcée</hi>,) the vessels-of-war and privateers of the
                                two belligerent parties, unless for twice twenty-four hours, and not
                                to permit them, when they are steamers, to provide themselves with a
                                quantity of coal more than sufficient for a run of twenty-four
                                hours.</p>
                            <p>It is needless to add that the cabinet of the Hague will not depart
                                from the principles mentioned at the close of my reply of the 17th
                                September, of which you demand the application; it does know and
                                will know how to act in conformity with the obligations of
                                impartiality and of neutrality, without losing sight of the care for
                                its own dignity.</p>
                            <p>Called by the confidence of the King to maintain that dignity, to
                                defend the rights of the Crown, and to direct the relations of the
                                state with foreign powers, I know not how to conceal from you, sir,
                                that certain expressions in <pb n="380" xml:id="pg_380" facs="0380"
                                /> your communications above mentioned, of the 23d and 25th
                                September last, have caused an unpleasant impression on the King’s
                                government, and do not appear to me to correspond with the manner in
                                which I have striven to treat the question now under discussion, or
                                with the desire which actuates the government of the Netherlands to
                                seek for a solution perfectly in harmony with its sentiments of
                                friendship towards the United States, and with the observance of
                                treaties.</p>
                            <p>The feeling of distrust which seems to have dictated your last
                                despatch of the 8th of this month, and which shows itself especially
                                in some entirely erroneous appreciations of the conduct of the
                                government of the Netherlands, gives to the last, strong in its good
                                faith and in its friendly intentions, just cause for astonishment.
                                So, then, the cabinet of which I have the honor to form part deems
                                that it may dispense with undertaking a justification useless to all
                                who examine impartially and without passion the events which have
                                taken place.</p>
                            <p>The news which has reached me from the royal legations at London and
                                at Washington, relative to the conduct of the British government in
                                the affair of the Sumter, can only corroborate the views developed
                                in my reply of 17th September last, and in the present
                                communication.</p>
                            <p>It results from this, in effect, that not only has the British
                                government treated the Sumter exactly as was done at Curaçoa, since
                                that vessel sojourned six or seven days at the island of Trinidad,
                                where she was received amicably and considered as a vessel-of-war,
                                but that the crown lawyers of England, having been consulted on the
                                matter, have unanimously declared that the conduct of the governor
                                of that colony of England had been in all points in conformity with
                                the Queen’s proclamation of neutrality.</p>
                            <p>According to them the Sumter was not a privateer but a regular
                                vessel-of war, (duly commissioned,) belonging to a state possessing
                                the rights of war, (belligerent rights.)</p>
                            <p>The Sumter, then, has been treated as a vessel-of-war of the United
                                States would have been, and that vessel had the same right to obtain
                                supplies at Trinidad as any vessel belonging to the navy of the
                                northern States.</p>
                            <p>Accept, sir, the fresh assurance of my high consideration.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your despatch of the 25th of September,
                            No. 18, has been received. It is accompanied by a note which was
                            addressed to you by Baron Van Zuylen, on the 17th day of September last,
                            on the subject of the admission of the pirate steamer Sumter into the
                            port of Curaçoa.</p>
                        <p>I reproduce the account of that transaction, which was made by this
                            government a subject of complaint to the government of the Netherlands.
                            The steamer Sumter hove in sight of the port of Curaçoa on the evening
                            of the 15th of July, and fired a gun for the pilot, who immediately took
                            to sea. On his reaching the pirate vessel she hoisted what is called the
                            confederate flag, and the same being unknown in that port, the pilot
                            told the captain that he had to report to the governor before taking the
                            vessel into port. <pb n="381" xml:id="pg_381" facs="0381"/> The pilot
                            having made this report, the governor replied to the captain that,
                            according to orders from the supreme government, he could not admit
                            privateers into the port, nor their prizes, but in the case of distress,
                            and therefore the steamer could not be admitted before her character was
                            perfectly known.</p>
                        <p>In reply to this message the captain of the steamer remained outside of
                            the port until the next morning, when he sent a despatch to the
                            governor, by an officer, stating that his vessel being a duly
                            commissioned man-of-war of the Confederate States, he desired to enter
                            the port for a few days. The colonial court assembled the same evening,
                            and, on the ground of the declaration and assurance of the privateer
                            captain that the vessel is not a privateer, it was decided that she
                            should enter the port, and she entered accordingly.</p>
                        <p>The consul of the United States thereupon informed the governor, by a
                            note, that the steamer was, by the laws and express declaration of the
                            United States, a pirate, and that on her way from New Orleans to Curaçoa
                            she had taken and sent for sale to the Spanish island of Cuba several
                            American merchant vessels, and on these grounds he asked upon what
                            pretext and conditions the unlawful steamer had obtained admittance into
                            Curaçoa.</p>
                        <p>The governor answered that, according to the orders received from the
                            supreme government, neither privateers nor their prizes are to be
                            allowed admittance to the ports or bays of this colony, save only in
                            cases of distress. But that this prohibition does not extend to
                            vessels-of-war, and that the Sumter being a man-of-war, according to the
                            rules of nations, could not be repelled from that port.</p>
                        <p>The piratical vessel was then supplied, at Curaçoa, with 120 tons of
                            coals, and departed at her own time and pleasure. On receiving this
                            information you were instructed to call the attention of the government
                            of the Netherlands to the proceeding of the governor of Curaçoa, and to
                            ask that the proceedings, if correctly reported, might be disavowed, and
                            that the governor might be made to feel the displeasure of his
                            government.</p>
                        <p>You performed this duty in due season by addressing a proper note to
                            Baron Van Zuylen. On the 2d of September he acknowledged your note, and
                            promised you an early reply on the merits of the subject.</p>
                        <p>On the 17th of September he communicated this reply to you in the note
                            which is now before me.</p>
                        <p>I encounter a difficulty in giving you instructions for your reply to
                            that paper, because, first, since the correspondence was opened, a
                            similar case of violation of our national rights has occurred in the
                            hospitalities extended to the same piratical vessel in the Dutch port of
                            Pernambuco, and has been made a subject of similar complaint, which, as
                            yet, so far as I am advised, remains unanswered; and, secondly, the note
                            of Baron Van Zuylen promises that special instructions shall be speedily
                            given to the colonial authorities of the Netherlands in regard to
                            conduct in cases similar to those which have induced the existing
                            complaints. I cannot, of course, forsee how far those instructions, yet
                            unknown to me, may modify the position assumed by the minister of
                            foreign affairs in the paper under consideration.</p>
                        <p>Under these circumstances, I must be content with setting forth, for the
                            information of the government of the Netherlands, just what the United
                            States claim and expect in regard to the matter in debate.</p>
                        <p>They have asked for an explanation of the case, presented by the
                            admission of the Sumter by the governor of Curaçoa, if one can be
                            satisfactorily given; and if not, then for a disavowal of that officer’s
                            proceedings, attended by a justly deserved rebuke.</p>
                        <p>These demands have been made, not from irritation or any sensibility <pb
                                n="382" xml:id="pg_382" facs="0382"/> of national pride, but to make
                            it sure that henceforth any piratical vessel fitted out by or under the
                            agency of disloyal American citizens, and cruising in pursuit of
                            merchant vessels of the United States, shall not be admitted into either
                            the continental or the colonial ports of the Netherlands under any
                            pretext whatever. If that assurance cannot be obtained in some way, we
                            must provide for the protection of our rights in some other way. Thus,
                            the subject is one of a purely practical character; it neither requires
                            nor admits of debate or argument on the part of the United States. If
                            what is thus desired shall be obtained by the United States in any way,
                            they will be satisfied; if it fails to be obtained through the
                            disinclination of the government of the Netherlands, its proceedings in
                            this respect will be deemed unfriendly and injurious to the United
                            States. The United States being thus disposed to treat the subject in a
                            practical way, they are not tenacious about the manner or form in which
                            the due respect to their rights is manifested by the government of the
                            Netherlands, and still less about the considerations or arguments upon
                            which that government regulates its own conduct in the matter. They
                            regard the whole insurrection in this country as ephemeral; indeed, they
                            believe that the attempt at piracy under the name of privateering, made
                            by the insurgents, has already well nigh failed. While, therefore, they
                            insist that shelter shall not be afforded to the pirates by nations in
                            friendship with the United States, they, at the same time, are not
                            unwilling to avoid grave debates concerning their rights that might
                            survive the existing controversy. It remains only to say in this
                            connexion that the course which the United States are pursuing in their
                            complaints to the government of the Netherlands is not peculiar, but it
                            is the same which has been and which will be pursued towards any other
                            maritime power on the occurrence of similar grievances.</p>
                        <p>With these remarks, I proceed to notice Baron Van Zuylen’s communication.
                            You will reply to him that the United States unreservedly claim to
                            determine for themselves absolutely the character of the Sumter, she
                            being a vessel fitted out, owned, armed, sailed, and directed by
                            American citizens who owe allegiance to the United States, and who
                            neither have nor can, in their piratical purposes and pursuits, have or
                            claim any political authority from any lawful source whatever.</p>
                        <p>The United States regard the vessel as piratical, and the persons by whom
                            she is manned and navigated as pirates.</p>
                        <p>The United States, therefore, cannot admit that the Sumter is a
                            ship-of-war or a privateer, and so entitled to any privileges whatever,
                            in either of those characters, in the port of Curaçoa; nor can they
                            debate any such subject with the government of the Netherlands. This
                            will be all that you will need to say in reply to the whole of Baron Von
                            Zuylen’s note, except that portion of it which states, rather by way of
                            argument than of assertion, that according to the information received
                            from the governor of Curaçoa, (by the government of the Netherlands,)
                            the Sumter was actually in distress, and that funtionary, therefore,
                            could not refuse to allow the said vessel to enter the port.</p>
                        <p>If this position shall be actually assumed by the government of the
                            Netherlands, two questions will arise: first, whether the fact that the
                            Sumter was in distress was true, or a belief of the truth of that fact
                            was the real ground upon which she was admitted by the colonial governor
                            into the port of Curaçoa; secondly, how far a piratical vessel, roving
                            over the seas in pursuit of peaceful commercial vessels of the United
                            States, and fleeing before their naval pursuit, but falling into
                            distress herself, is entitled to charity at the hands of a State,
                            friendly to the nation upon whose commerce her depredations are
                            directed.</p>
                        <p>It would hence be idle to occupy ourselves with a discussion of these <pb
                                n="383" xml:id="pg_383" facs="0383"/> questions until we know that
                            the government of the Netherlands determines to stand upon the main
                            position from which they are derived.</p>
                        <p>You will therefore ask the Baron Van Zuylen for an explicit statement on
                            this subject.</p>
                        <p>I cannot but hope, however, that the government of the Netherlands will
                            come to the conclusion that it is wisest and best, in view of the
                            relations of the two countries, to give such directions to its agents as
                            will render further prosecution of this discussion unnecessary, while it
                            will prevent similar injuries in future to our national dignity and
                            honor. Should it determine otherwise, and not be able to place the
                            conduct of the governor general at Curaçoa in a better light than it has
                            already done, it will become necessary to consider what means we can
                            take to protect, in the ports of the Netherlands, national rights which
                            cannot be surrendered or compromised.</p>
                        <p>I am, sir, your obedient servant,</p>

                            16th instant, the last communication of this government in respect to
                            the “Sumter” case, referring to the orders recently given to its
                            colonial authorities, by which the stay of such vessels in Dutch ports
                            is limited to 24 hours, and by which they are also forbidden to take on
                            board more than 24 hours’ supply of coal.</p>
                        <p>Considering these orders to be important, I have, in the following copy
                            of my reply to the Dutch government, ventured to express a qualified
                            satisfaction at their issue. I am in hopes you will adopt a similar view
                            of the case, as I conceive this government to be well disposed towards
                            the United States, and to consider that it has strained a point in our
                            favor.</p>
                        <p>I doubt if England or France will do anything of the sort; but the course
                            of Holland will, at least, furnish excellent grounds for some pertinent
                            questions in case they decline.</p>
                        <p>I have informed Mr. Adams, and also Mr. Dayton and Mr. Schurz, of the
                            final action of this government in this case. The copy of my note
                            follows, (to Baron Van Zuylen.)</p>

                            <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In reply to your communication of the
                                15th instant, which I have had the honor to receive, I take pleasure
                                in assuring your excellency that it has been far from my purpose to
                                say anything at any time which should occasion painful impressions
                                on the part of his Majesty’s government, or to use language marked
                                by impatience or irritation at the course of the government of the
                                Netherlands. But while making this disclaimer, frankness compels me
                                to add that I should not know in what more moderate terms to express
                                my sentiments than those I have had the honor to employ in
                                addressing his Majesty’s government.</p>
                            <p>“I desire further to say, in respect to that part of your
                                excellency’s communication which refers to the recent orders given
                                to the Dutch colonial authorities not to permit vessels engaged in
                                pirating upon United States <pb n="384" xml:id="pg_384" facs="0384"
                                /> commerce to remain in their ports more than 24 hours, and, when
                                steamers, not to be furnished with more than 24 hours’ supply of
                                fuel, that, while I receive the announcement with satisfaction, it
                                is qualified by deep regrets at the position his Majesty’s
                                government has thought proper to take in placing the misguided
                                persons in rebellion against the United States on a footing of
                                equality, in a most important respect, with the government to which
                                they owe obedience; for, though the orders in question deny shelter
                                and aid to pirates, it is impossible to regard with complacency the
                                fact that the exclusion operates equally against the vessels of the
                                United States, denying to them that accustomed hospitality ever
                                accorded by friendly nations.</p>
                            <p>“Abstaining, however, now as heretofore, from any discussion on this
                                topic while awaiting the reply of my government to your
                                communication of the 17th of September, I will only add that I feel
                                assured the United States government will fully share these regrets,
                                and I can only hope will not impeach my expressions of satisfaction
                                at the orders which you inform me have been given in accordance with
                                the rule of action laid down in that paper, notwithstanding the
                                position falls so far short of that which the United States have

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have had the honor to receive your
                                letter of the 22d of this month, relative to the affair of the
                                “Sumter,” and it has been gratifying to me to learn from its tenor
                                that you have received with satisfaction the information as to the
                                measures adopted by the government of the Low Countries to prevent
                                the return or the prolonged stay in its ports of vessels which, like
                                the “Sumter,” seemed to desire to use them as the base of their
                                operations against the commerce of the adverse party.</p>
                            <p>You regret only that the government of the King should have adopted
                                the same treatment towards the war vessels of the seceding States
                                and those of the United States.</p>
                            <p>Without entering here into an extended discussion, rendered,
                                moreover, almost superfluous by my two preceding communications, I
                                shall merely permit myself, sir, in referring to their contents, to
                                cause you to observe that, agreeably to the doctrine of the best
                                publicists, neutrality imposes upon those nations which desire to
                                enjoy its benefits a complete abstention from all that could
                                establish a difference of treatment between the belligerent parties,
                                and that this principle applies as well to the cases of civil war,
                                or even of rebellion, as to that of an ordinary war.</p>
                            <pb n="386" xml:id="pg_386" facs="0386"/>
                            <p>Your government having desired that measures should be taken to
                                prevent a prolonged stay in our ports of the Sumter, or of other
                                vessels-of-war of the seceding States, we have admitted the justice
                                of this claim. But these measures could not reach exclusively one of
                                the two parties; they were to be general, and the consequence of it
                                is that the new instructions given to the governors of Curaçoa and
                                of Surinam neither permit the vessels-of-war of the United States,
                                except in the case of being compelled to put into a port, to sojourn
                                in the ports of the Netherlands, in the West Indies, for a longer
                                time than twice 24 hours, (and not for only 24 hours, as you seem to
                                believe.)</p>
                            <p>Nevertheless, the privateers, with or without their prizes, are, as
                                heretofore, excluded from the Netherland ports, and it is by an
                                oversight, which I hasten to rectify, that the words “and the
                                privateers” have been introduced into that part of my communication
                                of the 15th of this month which calls your attention to the
                                instructions transmitted to the colonial authorities.</p>
                            <p>Be pleased, sir, to accopt the renewed assurance of my high
                                consideration.</p>

                            has been received.</p>
                        <p>I learn from it that the government of the Netherlands has made an order
                            which will, it is hoped, practically prevent the recurrence of such
                            countenance and favor to pirates in the ports of that state as we have
                            heretofore complained of. You will express to Baron Zuylen our
                            satisfaction with this proceeding, viewed in that light, but you will be
                            no less explicit in saying that this government by no means assents to
                            the qualifications affecting its claims as a sovereign power upon the
                            Netherlands by which the proceeding is qualified.</p>
                        <p>Not only are we not seeking occasions for difference with any foreign
                            powers, but we are, on the other hand, endeavoring to preserve amity and
                            friendship with them all, in a crisis which tries the magnanimity of our
                            country. Influenced by these feelings, I can only hope that no new
                            injury or disrespect to our flag may occur in the ports of the
                            Netherlands, to bring the action of their government again under review
                            by us.</p>
                        <p>I am directed by the President to express his approval of the diligence
                            and discretion you have practiced in this important transaction.</p>

                        <p>I had the honor, on the 25th instant, to receive your circular of the
                            20th ultimo, with its enclosure, addressed to the late minister
                            resident, respecting the fitting out of privateers in Turkey to act
                            against the commerce of the United States, and shall give my faithful
                            and vigilant attention to the orders which it contains. The minister
                            resident, on his departure, gave me the “circulars” of the department,
                            one of February 28, and the other of March 9, 1861, of which he had not
                            either acknowledged the receipt, nor made any use in carrying out the
                            injunctions of the President. These, also, call for my immediate
                            attention, and shall be faithfully executed.</p>
                        <p>I would here take occasion to add that I am confident there is not now
                            one citizen of the United States in this place animated with sentiments
                            other than those of entire loyalty to the government of the United
                            States, and of devotion to the cause of the Union. Not only from the
                            members of all the foreign legations resident here, but also from all
                            foreigners in this city, I receive expressions of the most friendly
                            nature in favor of the American Union. The unhappy and misguided
                            position assumed by some of its southern States is deeply deplored and
                            strongly condemned by them, and all entertain the hope that a returning
                            sense of patriotism, and a correct view of their own interests, will,
                            before long, restore peace and happiness to our great and prosperous
                            country. These are, also, the sentiments expressed by all of the
                            functionaries of the Sultan’s government; and I believe it will, at any
                            time, be easy for the legation to invoke the most friendly conduct on
                            the part of the Sublime Porte in behalf of the government of the United
                            States of America.</p>

                            as will preserve the Union intact. H. H. warmly deprecated the principle
                            of “secession,” advocated by the southern States, as ruinous to all
                            governments, and especially to the great American republic, the strength
                            of which so much depends upon its unity. He expressed a warm interest in
                            the future welfare and prosperity of the government of the United
                            States, from which the sublime porte has received so many evidences of a
                            sincere and disinterested friendship.</p>
                        <p>The Sultan is acting with much energy of character, and introducing many
                            salutary and greatly needed financial reforms in the government. His
                            activity and intelligence have already rendered him very popular among
                            his subjects, and inspire them with great hopes for the future of the
                            empire. There exists perfect harmony and co-operation among all his
                            ministers and other public functionaries.</p>

                            also copies of a letter from his highness, and my reply, on his recent

                        <p>Yesterday I called, by appointment, upon Count Manderstrom, minister of
                            foreign affairs. Count M., in behalf of his government, welcomed me most
                            cordially to Sweden as the representative of the United States of
                            America. Count Manderstrom informed me of the absence of his Majesty in
                            Norway, whose return was daily expected, and that an early day would be
                            fixed for the audience to present my letter of credence. During the
                            interview he referred to the condition of affairs in the United States,
                            and expressed himself strongly in favor of our government.</p>
                        <p>From the limited opportunity I have had to judge, I have no hesitation in
                            the declaration of the opinion that the sympathy of the entire north of
                            Europe is almost unanimously in favor of the existing government of the
                            United States. The emigration from this part of Europe having been to
                            the northern or free States, they speak as if they would like to give
                            active aid to their friends, relatives, and countrymen.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor, in reply to your
                            circular of May 20, to inform you that I am almost confident no effort
                            or attempt to purchase articles contraband of war, or to fit out vessels
                            in any port of Sweden, under letters of marque, need be apprehended. The
                            public voice of this nation, represented by a free press, is clearly and
                            emphatically in favor of my government, and view secession as a
                            causeless rebellion, which ought to be suppressed by the strong arm of
                            military law. Should, contrary to my expectation, efforts be made by
                            mercenary men to give in any manner assistance to the rebels, I have no
                            doubt I shall receive information of the fact in time to call the
                            attention of his Majesty’s government to the subject.</p>
                        <p>Frequently application has been made to me by honorable discharged
                            officers of the army of Sweden to know if their services would be
                            accepted by my government, and on what conditions. I have replied that I

                            on their arrival in America and entering the service. Two of these
                            officers are eminent military engineers.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Since I last wrote quite a change is
                            visible in diplomatic circles in regard to American affairs. They now
                            speak out openly that the government of the United States should act
                            vigorously and efficiently; enforce the laws by the strong arm of
                            military power; that the rebellion should be annihilated by force and
                            not by compromise; that is a mistaken policy to suppose that delay and
                            the holding out of the olive branch ever fitted rebels for grace, or
                            brought them to a sense of their guilt.</p>
                        <p rend="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
                        <p>On the 29th of July the King joins his fleet in the Baltic, and will
                            visit the coasts of Norway and Denmark; he will be absent some four or
                            five weeks. Her Majesty at the same time visits her parents, the King
                            and Queen of Holland. Count Edward Piper, who has been appointed
                            minister to the United States, is one of the first noblemen in Sweden,
                            with a thorough English education and manners, and whose appointment was
                            intended as a compliment to the United States. Count Manderstrom
                            informed me at our last conference that a large Swedish frigate would be
                            sent to the American waters to protect Swedish interests against
                            privateers if it should be necessary. From all quarters the firm and
                            decided course of the administration is spoken of with respect and
                            esteem; no one now seems to doubt of the speedy triumph of the
                            government.</p>

                            has been received, and it is entirely satisfactory in regard to your own

                        <p>We notice with much pleasure the willingness of military gentlemen of
                            talent and experience in Sweden, as in other nations, to enter the army
                            of the United States. It is a proof of a sympathy with our great cause
                            of inestimable value. We wish, indeed, that we were able to engage to
                            accept all who should come. But this is impossible, for the reason that
                            they are coming in unknown numbers from various European states, while
                            at the same time a long repressed martial spirit has broken out among
                            our own countrymen, which gives us more candidates than we have places
                            for.</p>
                        <p>Gradually we have taken into the service several able and spirited

                            of affairs in the United States, but when I assured him, as I had before
                            done on a similar occasion, that the Union would be preserved, his
                            manner was more expressive of doubt than belief, though he replied that
                            he hoped I was not mistaken, as it would be a great pity to see so fine
                            a country ruined, and I regret to say that my colleagues, and European
                            politicians generally, regard the disruption of the States as an

                            privateers.</p>
                        <p>I have notified our consular agents of the importance of vigilance.</p>
                        <p>Would it not be good policy to take into regular commission a
                            considerable number of our clipper ships, till our navy can be placed on
                            a basis commensurate with the crisis?</p>
                        <p>The telegraph announces that the President has notified the foreign
                            powers that he will discontinue diplomatic relations with any nation
                            that recognizes the so-called Confederate States.</p>
                        <p>I trust that it is true, for such a policy will produce good results, and
                            is not less wise than it is dignified.</p>
                        <p>If we come out of this contest triumphant, and the Union be preserved,
                            our nation will be more powerful and more glorious, more loved and more

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: A combination of individuals in
                                certain of the southern States of the United States have raised the
                                standard of insurrection, and under the pretended authority of the
                                self-styled Confederate States of America have threatened to grant
                                pretended letters of marque for the purpose of committing assaults
                                on the lives, vessels, and property of good citizens of the United
                                States, lawfully engaged in commerce on the high seas, and in the
                                waters of the United States. And in consequence thereof, on the 19th
                                day of April, 1861, and the eighty-fifth year of the independence of
                                the United States, the President, by formal proclamation, declared
                                that if any person, under the pretended authority of the said
                                so-called but unrecognized Confederate States, or under any other
                                pretence, shall molest a vessel of the United States, or the persons
                                or cargo on board of her, that such person will be held amenable to
                                the laws of the United States for the punishment of piracy.</p>
                            <p>In the name, therefore, of the government of the United States, I
                                have the honor to request that the government of H. M. F. Majesty
                                may cause such measures to be taken as will effectually prevent any
                                vessel from being prepared in any of his Majesty’s ports for the
                                aforesaid piratical purposes.</p>
                            <p>Under the conviction that reliable information as to said
                                insurrection will be gratifying to his Majesty’s government, I
                                briefly submit the following statement: <list>
                                    <label>1.</label>
                                    <item>The government of the so-called Confederate States has
                                        been neither recognized by any sovereign state, nor has it
                                        been acknowledged by the people it professes to represent.
                                        But, on the contrary, the combination of individuals who
                                        have usurped the title of a government refuse to submit
                                        their constitution to the ratification or rejection of the
                                        citizens of said States.</item>
                                    <label>2.</label>
                                    <item>The insurrectionists are wanting in the great elements
                                        necessary to successful war. Their ports are strictly
                                        blockaded; their supplies are cut off, by land and by sea,
                                        and within themselves they are destitute of the means of
                                        carrying on a prolonged struggle.</item>

                                        in the future nothing can be more certain than are the

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have just had my first interview with
                            Mr. d’Avila, the minister of foreign affairs, since being presented to
                            the King, and desire to report its purpose and character. While no
                            instructions have reached me in regard to the desired action of this
                            government concerning privateers, I considered it proper, in view of the
                            facilities offered by the ports of Portugal and her colonies to prizes,
                            to call the attention of the proper authorities to it at the earliest
                            opportunity when I was in an official position to do so with effect.</p>
                        <p>On the very day of my arrival here, and when I did not anticipate the
                            painful delays and difficulties which have since occurred, I told
                            General Morgan of my intention to ask for a proclamation excluding
                            privateers, as soon as I was presented. He addressed a note to the
                            foreign office on the 2d instant, in which the general question was
                            discussed at much length. And although he afterwards called several
                            times upon Mr. d’Avila, no answer was obtained before his departure
                            yesterday.</p>
                        <p>These were the circumstances under which I felt it necessary to go
                            forward and to ask for some decisive action. I told Mr. d’Avila frankly
                            that I did not desire to signalize my advent here by any protracted
                            correspondence, and least of all by a controversy, and that the
                            sentiments which I had expressed at my audience of presentation were
                            those which really animated me. I informed him that a condition of
                            affairs existed in the United States which required me to claim an early
                            and positive expression of views by the Portuguese government on this
                            subject, and therefore he must excuse my seeming urgency. He inquired if
                            I adopted the note which General Morgan had addressed to him. I answered
                            that I accepted the principle, but was willing to waive a
                            correspondence, if the object could be accomplished by a direct and
                            candid interchange of opinions orally, when there would be less
                            difficulty in understanding each other, and a readier mode of reaching a
                            conclusion promptly. He concurred in this suggestion, and said it
                            reflected his own sincere dispositions.</p>
                        <p>I then told him that a proclamation forbidding the ports of Portugal and
                            her colonies to privateers and their prizes, in explicit terms, would be
                            satisfactory, and argued that, as Portugal had acquiesced in the treaty
                            of Paris of 1856, there ought to be no difficulty in making this
                            declaration. In order to strengthen the reason, I suggested that the
                            proclamation might be made broad and general, because I most desired the
                            assertion of a practical principle which would cover the case
                            completely. He seemed to assent to the idea, and remarked that it was
                            disembarrassed materially by the fact that the government of the United
                            States had discountenanced the issuing of letters of marque. I told him
                            that the government had not only done that, but that it deprecated and
                            denounced the system, which certain insurrectionary and tumultuous
                            assemblages of people had proclaimed with a professed authority.</p>
                        <p>In order that no misapprehension might occur, I notified Mr. d’Avila that
                            a proclamation or declaration which, in doubtful phrases or by
                            implication, recognized the existence of any pretended organization in
                            the United States, independent of the government which accredited me,
                            and which alone has power to make treaties and conduct diplomatic
                            intercourse, would be regarded as a most unfriendly act by the
                            President.</p>
                        <p>After again urging upon him reasons for an early decision, he explained
                            that the cortes were now in session night and day, but expected to
                            adjourn soon, when he would lay the matter before the King’s council,
                            and obtain their opinion, which he thought would conform to my request.
                            I asked him <pb n="406" xml:id="pg_406" facs="0406"/> to name a
                            convenient day when an answer might be expected. He declined fixing a
                            time certain, but expressed the belief that by the middle of next week
                            the council could be convened, and this subject should have precedence
                            over all others.</p>
                        <p>In proposing a proclamation such as I have suggested, vessels-of-war and
                            their prizes would be allowed entry to the ports of Portugal, which the
                            English and French governments have expressly excluded, putting them on
                            the same footing with privateers. As I have acted upon my own motion in
                            this matter, I submit it to your approbation.</p>
                        <p>With high respect, your obedient servant.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Since my despatch (No. 6) of the 25th
                            instant, information reached me * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
                            * * * * * that plans were concerted by the parties who had recently
                            applied for the privilege of fitting out a privateer, and others, to
                            accept letters of marque from the so-called Confederate States, and to
                            use some of the remote islands of Portugal as places of rendezvous for
                            outfit and for the disposal of any prizes that might be taken.</p>
                        <p>In view of the facilities offered for these nefarious enterprises in the

                            <p>The undersigned presents his compliments to his excellency M.
                                d’Avila, minister of foreign affairs of his most faithful Majesty,
                                and begs leave to repeat in this form, for the convenience of a more
                                precise understanding, the substance of the ideas which he had the
                                honor to express in his interview with his excellency on the 25th
                                instant.</p>
                            <p>Portugal has acceded fully to the anti-privateering doctrine
                                established by the declaration of the congress of Paris of April,
                                1856, to which the assent of the United States has recently been
                                given.</p>
                            <p>Opposed to the principle and practice of privateering, Portugal ought
                                not <pb n="407" xml:id="pg_407" facs="0407"/> to hesitate, as it
                                appears to the undersigned, to declare by general proclamation, as a
                                general principle and rule, that her ports are no longer open to
                                privateers or their prizes.</p>
                            <p>This is the extent of the present request of the undersigned. He does
                                not ask that Portugal shall make any particular application of the
                                general rule to the peculiar and unhappy state of things now
                                existing in the United States, nor that any unnecessary notice or
                                cognizance should be taken of the disturbed condition of domestic
                                affairs in the United States. Indeed, the government of the United
                                States would not view with satisfaction any such superfluous and
                                unnecessary expression of views or sentiments by any foreign power
                                in regard to a state of things purely domestic, local, and
                                temporary, to which a satisfactory termination will soon be placed
                                by the ample power of the United States government. On the contrary,
                                as the undersigned took occasion to assure his excellency M.
                                d’Avila, at the personal interview referred to, any declaration
                                which recognized the existence, even by implication, of a pretended
                                organization in the United States, independent of the government,
                                which alone has the power to make treaties, and to conduct
                                diplomatic intercourse, and the authority of which cannot be
                                questioned, would be considered as a most unfriendly act.</p>
                            <p>As little as the government of the United States would pretend to
                                interfere in any analogous question that might possibly arise
                                between the government of his most faithful Majesty and any of the
                                provinces, of his kingdom, can the United States be disposed to view
                                with satisfaction any such expression as that suggested on the part
                                of his or any foreign government. At the same time it is manifest
                                that questions of the most embarrassing and even dangerous character
                                are, at any moment, liable to occur, if unlawful and piratical
                                privateers, with unlawful prizes, should make their appearance in
                                the waters of Portugal or her colonies, and it is with a view to the
                                amicable anticipation of such possible contingencies that the
                                undersigned has requested, and now repeats the request, that the
                                government of his most faithful Majesty should simply carry out, to
                                its natural and necessary consequence and application, the principle
                                of the declaration of Paris above referred to, as having been fully
                                acceded to by the enlightened government of his most faithful
                                Majesty.</p>
                            <p>The undersigned begs to add the expression of his hopes that in
                                advance of the issue of the proclamation, which, under these
                                circumstances, he believes and expects will be issued at the
                                earliest convenient day by his most faithful Majesty, the
                                undersigned may be favored with an opportunity of seeing the
                                proposed terms of the same, in order that, by means of frank
                                interchange of views, there may be the more perfect certainty of
                                such a friendly and reciprocally satisfactory harmony of views
                                between the two governments as shall correspond to the sentiments
                                already fully expressed by the undersigned on behalf of the
                                President of the United States, and most satisfactorily and
                                cordially responded to by his most faithful Majesty.</p>
                            <p>In conclusion, the undersigned respectfully asks that this subject,
                                in view of its importance and possible complications, may be brought
                                to the early notice of his most faithful Majesty, so as to preclude
                                the happening of events which might involve grave consequences, to
                                which the interests and good will of both nations are alike opposed.
                                He appreciates the reasons which have been assigned for the delay,
                                since the subject was first presented by his immediate predecessor,
                                in a note to his excellency M. d’Avila, dated on the 2d of July; but
                                urgent considerations have recently arisen which require the
                                undersigned to submit this request on behalf of the government of
                                the United States.</p>
                            <p>The undersigned avails himself of this occasion to renew the
                                assurances of his most distinguished consideration.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I received a note from Mr. d’Avila, the
                            minister of foreign affairs, yesterday, requesting an interview with me
                            at 4 o’clock. I called at the foreign office at the appointed hour, and
                            he immediately presented the original draft, in Portuguese, of a
                            proposed proclamation, of which I enclose a translated copy, marked No.
                            2. After hearing it read and reduced into English, I expressed my
                            acceptance of its general scope and spirit, but expressly demurred to
                            the declaration at the end of article 2, by which armed vessels are
                            placed in the same category as privateers in regard to prizes. Although
                            I knew it was of no practical importance to the United States under
                            present circumstances, it was easy to foresee that in the event of war
                            with England or France, and with their ability to blockade our ports,
                            that prizes taken by American ships-of-war would be thus excluded from
                            Portugal and her possessions. Hence my objection to that point. I told
                            Mr. d’Avila that it went beyond the treaty of Paris, upon which the
                            proclamation was professedly predicated, and that it did what I had
                            sought to avoid by introducing indirectly our domestic question. He said
                            his object was to exclude the prizes of vessels-of-war of the so-called
                            Confederate States, in case they should create a navy, and thus to guard
                            against any future complication. To this suggestion I answered that, as
                            we were not dealing with supposititious or hypothetical cases, it was
                            necessary to adhere to the practical question, and, as we had stated, on
                            the basis of the declaration of Paris in regard to privateering and his
                            own preamble set out with that statement, the introduction of any
                            extraneous matter would be not only irrelevant, but likely to defeat the
                            object which both sides alike professed to have in view. He did not
                            respond to this suggestion, but agreed to let me take the rough draft,
                            in order that I might submit whatever observations might occur to me as
                            appropriate.</p>
                        <p>I prepared the accompanying note (marked No. 1) this morning, and sent it
                            to Mr. d’Avila an hour ago.</p>
                        <p>There are two councils before which such questions are considered; first,
                            the council of ministers or the cabinet; and second, the council of
                            state, which is a larger body, and includes the cabinet and other
                            distinguished persons. I understood Mr. d’Avila to say that the draft of
                            the proclamation had been laid before the former, and approved by them,
                            and that my proposed amendment must, therefore, be presented at another
                            meeting. I have reason to believe that my note of Saturday precipitated
                            this action, which, in a country where diplomacy is proverbially slow,
                            exhibits unusual promptitude.</p>
                        <p>I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

                            <p>The undersigned presents his most respectful compliments to his
                                excellency M. d’Avila and referring to the conversation he had the
                                honor to have with his excellency yesterday, and repeating his
                                thanks for his excellency’s courtesy in showing him the draft of the
                                proclamation contemplated by the government of his most faithful
                                Majesty, as a proper consequence and application of the principles
                                adopted by Portugal by her adhesion to the declaration of Paris of
                                April, 1856, he begs leave to submit the following observations to
                                his excellency’s enlightened consideration:</p>
                            <p>The declaration of Paris abolished privateering. It would seem to
                                follow as a necessary logical consequence to all powers acceding to
                                the same, that under no circumstances (except those of force, <hi
                                    rend="italic">majeure</hi>, and brief, indispensable
                                hospitality, in view of the laws of humanity) ought their ports to
                                be open to the admission of privateers or their prizes. So far,
                                then, as regards privateers and their prizes, the undersigned sees
                                nothing but what he must approve in the draft of the proclamation
                                referred to.</p>
                            <p>But the declaration of Paris did not go further, and change the
                                established maritime law of the world in regard to the legality of
                                the capture of prizes by the regular men-of-war of the naval forces
                                whose fleets roam the ocean. Such prizes have always been deemed
                                legitimate, and still remain so. It is no application of the
                                principles of the declaration of Paris to exclude such regular and
                                lawful prizes, made by the regular vessels of one nation, from the
                                ports of a friendly nation. In this respect the words, “<hi
                                    rend="italic">on por embareacoes annadas</hi>,” at the end of
                                article 2, appear not only to go much beyond the principles of the
                                declaration referred to, but even to be most unnecessarily
                                introduced into a proclamation avowedly designed for the mere”
                                execution and practical application of the principles of that
                                declaration. To introduce them at this moment in such a proclamation
                                would be deemed by the government of the United States not only as a
                                gratuitous deviation from the terms of the preamble to the same
                                proclamation, but as a deviation prompted by a reason which would
                                seem to involve an indirect, if not a direct, reference to the
                                present rebellion of a small portion of the United States. It would
                                be understood as placing on the same level the regular men-of-war of
                                the United States and the privateers of the States now in rebellion,
                                so far as regards the prizes made by them. It is only with reference
                                to the principle involved, to the apparent inconsistency between the
                                preamble and the sequence, and to the misconstruction to which it
                                would be consequently liable, that the undersigned indulges the hope
                                and expectation that the few words above cited may be omitted from
                                the proposed proclamation, and takes occasion to say that in that
                                form it will be perfectly acceptable to the government of the United
                                States, and will add another to the many links of friendly relation
                                and intercourse which already bind closely together the two
                                countries.</p>
                            <p>It is only proper for the undersigned to notify his excellency M.
                                d’Avila that information has been communicated to the government of
                                the United States which authorizes the belief that some of the
                                remote islands and colonies of this kingdom are proposed to be used
                                by designing and reckless persons to engage in the nefarious
                                enterprises referred to by the equipment of privateers, or the sale
                                of prizes, if any should be taken. He knows perfectly well, in
                                advance of any assurance, that such lawless undertakings would be
                                sternly deprecated by the government of his most faithful Majesty;
                                but his excellency cannot fail to discover in this fact an urgent
                                    <pb n="410" xml:id="pg_410" facs="0410"/> reason why a
                                proclamation of such sentiments, and in the unobjectionable form
                                suggested, should be immediately made. It is with this view, and to
                                provide against the contingency of future, and perhaps of impending,
                                difficulty, that the undersigned has brought the subject thus
                                promptly to the notice of his excellency, and with the most friendly
                                spirit and purpose.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Morgan’s despatch No. 70, of the date of July 5, has been received. I
                            am instructed by the President to say that Mr. Morgan’s proceeding in
                            addressing the Portuguese government on the subject of allowing the
                            fitting out or harboring of privateers to prey upon the commerce of the,
                            United <pb n="411" xml:id="pg_411" facs="0411"/> States is approved, as
                            well as the general tenor of his communication on that occasion.</p>
                        <p>The President cannot for a moment allow the belief that Portugal would be
                            the only or even the first power to permit proceedings so injurious to
                            the United States as a license or shelter granted to pirates engaged in
                            preying on their commerce would be. Nevertheless, we shall look not
                            without some solicitude for the result of the matter thus initiated by
                            Mr. Morgan.</p>
                        <p>Please assure him, if he is yet remaining in Lisbon, of the entire

                            ministers, or cabinet, were not only well disposed to adopt my proposed
                            amendment, but that they submitted the proclamation with the
                            revision.</p>
                        <p>When this fact became known to me, I urged, with every influence and
                            persuasion at my command, an immediate decision, so as to insure the
                            promulgation before any interrupting cause or accident could intervene.
                            But the King went away for a short time, and a council of state, to
                            which the proposed action of the council of ministers on important
                            questions is presented for examination, could not be convened. In the
                            meantime intelligence from the United States of an eventful character
                            affected opinion here, and gave increased weight to the objections which
                            had been urged by the British minister and others against the form of
                            proclamation which I had requested. A council of state was summoned upon
                            the return of the King, and the result of their deliberations is to be
                            found in the documents enclosed in this despatch.</p>
                        <p>While I should have been greatly gratified had my amendment been
                            accepted, I have the satisfaction to know that it did not fail from any
                            want of zeal, energy, or effort on my part, and that the proclamation as
                            it now stands is mainly predicated upon your policy, in execution of the
                            principle of the treaty of Paris, and is not open to the objections
                            urged against those issued by England, France, or Spain.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, sir, very respectfully,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: You are appointed a minister to represent
                            the United States near the republic of Peru.</p>
                        <p>This appointment is an overture by this government, under the present
                            administration, to renew the friendly relations with Peru, which had
                            been suspended, on the motion of this government, when administered by
                            the last President, James Buchanan.</p>
                        <p>The Peruvian government may naturally ask and be entitled to an
                            explanation of this change of position on the part of the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>It is confessed to be unfortunate when any government has occasion to
                            reverse its policy in any material respect, especially a policy of
                            friendship or of hostility towards foreign nations. Inconstancy is
                            always liable to be mistaken for inconsistency, and inconsistency is too
                            often the result of caprice.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, when we come to explain such a change in any case, however
                            necessary it may have been, we shall still find it necessary to explain
                            in such a manner as shall not cause it to be understood that the
                            reconsideration is due to personal or partisan considerations indulged
                            by the government.</p>
                        <p>Keeping these points in view, you will be at liberty to say, in your
                            communications with the representatives and statesmen of the country to
                            which you are accredited, that the President of the United States
                            entertains the opinions that the several states founded on the American
                            continent have common interests, arising out of their neighborhood to
                            each other, their common attitudes towards states in the eastern
                            hemisphere, and the similarity of their commercial, social, and
                            political institutions; that owing to the inexperience of mankind in the
                            conduct of republican representative institutions, and the
                            incompleteness of assimilation in the population of these American
                            states, there is always too much danger of faction at home, while
                            faction at home inevitably tends to invite intrigues and intervention
                            from abroad for the overthrow of the American powers with hopes of
                            reconquest from Europe. For these reasons, the President of the United
                            States, without at all reflecting upon the sentiments or the action of
                            his predecessor, determined, on assuming the administration of the
                            government, to resist rather than to yield to influences which might
                            tend to introduce anarchy into any one of the American states, or
                            produce alienation and war between them.</p>
                        <p>In reviewing the causes assigned by his predecessor for withdrawing our
                            representative from Peru, he came to the conclusion that, although
                            serious differences had arisen between the two countries, yet that there
                            was no imperative necessity resulting from those differences for a
                            declaration of war against Peru. Not being able to recommend to Congress
                            the adoption of hostilities against Peru, it seemed to result that the
                            differences between the two states might be accommodated by the two
                            powers in case of renewed and pacific relations.</p>
                        <pb n="416" xml:id="pg_416" facs="0416"/>
                        <p>The questions in difference between the two countries will be a subject
                            of special instruction in a distinct paper. I confine myself in this
                            despatch to instructions for your conduct in presenting yourself at
                            Lima.</p>
                        <p>You will assure the government of Peru that the United States are sincere
                            and earnest in their friendship and affection for that republic; that
                            they desire its prosperity and advancement, equally for the welfare of
                            its own people and the best interests of civilization; and that
                            consistently with that regard for own rights, which every nation must
                            always cherish which is really independent, the United States will
                            always be found to manifest the most cordial sympathies with the

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The Spanish American states are important
                            characters in the interesting drama of advancing civilization. They
                            occupy a virgin domain equal to about one-eighth of the habitable part
                            of the globe. Its fountains of wealth are inexhaustible. Its position
                            secures it nearly equal advantages of trade and intercourse with the
                            listless nations of the east, and with the vigorous nations of the west.
                            Its ports, as well as all its transit routes are essential features in
                            the commerce of the world. With the advantages of youth and singular
                            exemption from foreign oppression or aggression which the Spanish
                            American states have enjoyed for near half a century, it might have been
                            expected that they would within that period have become strong and
                            influential nations. The fact, thus far, is otherwise. They are just
                            strong enough to maintain independence without securing necessary fear
                            or respect. With much versatility, respectable talent, high cultivation,
                            and very generous aspirations, they are generally changeful and
                            capricious. The very mention of a South American state suggests always
                            the same inquiry: why a people so free, so virtuous, so educated, and so
                            emulous, are not more secure, fortunate, and happy. Everybody wishes the
                            Spanish American states well, and yet everybody loses patience with them
                            for not being wiser, more constant, and more stable. Such, I imagine, is
                            the temper in which every foreign state finds itself when it proposes to
                            consider its relations to those republics, and especially the republics
                            of Central America. I know, at least, that this has always been the
                            temper of our best statesmen in regard to Nicaragua. Union, or, at
                            least, practical alliance with Nicaragua has always been felt by them as
                            a necessity for the United States, and yet no one ever deems it prudent
                            to counsel the establishment of such intimate relations. Possessing one
                            of the continental transits most interesting to the United States,
                            Nicaragua is at once jealous of foreign intervention to render it
                            available, and incompetent to open and maintain it herself. But
                            Nicaragua, like the other Spanish American states, has far better
                            excuses for its shortcomings than it generally has credit for. That
                            state became precociously mature, and it adopted our model of government
                            with little of that preliminary popular education and discipline which
                            seem necessary to enable any people to administer, maintain, and
                            preserve free republican institutions. The policy pursued by foreign
                            nations towards Nicaragua has not been liberator generous. Great
                            Britain, in her wars with Spain, early secured a position in the state
                            very detrimental to its independence, and used it to maintain the
                            Indians in a condition of defiance against the Creole population, while
                            it did nothing, at least nothing effectually, to civilize the tribes
                            whom it had taken under its protection. Unwilling to lend the aid
                            necessary to the improvement of the country, Great Britain used its
                            protectorate there to counteract domestic efforts and intervention from
                            this government to make that improvement which was necessary for the
                            interest of Nicaragua herself, and hardly less necessary <pb n="420"
                                xml:id="pg_420" facs="0420"/> for all the western nations. Our own
                            government has been scarcely less capricious, at one time seeming to
                            court the most intimate alliance, at another treating the new republic
                            with neglect and indifference, and at another indirectly, if not
                            directly, consenting to the conquest and desolation of the country by
                            our own citizens for the purpose of re-establishing the institution of
                            slavery, which it had wisely rejected. It may be doubtful whether
                            Nicaragua has not until this day been a loser instead of a gainer by her
                            propinquity to, and intercourse with, the United States.</p>
                        <p>Happily this condition of things has ceased at last. Great Britain has
                            discovered that her Mosquito protectorate was as useless to herself as
                            it was injurious to Nicaragua, and has abandoned it. The United States
                            no longer think that they want slavery re-established in that state, nor
                            do they desire anything at the hands of its government but that it may
                            so conduct its affairs as to permit and favor the opening of an
                            inter-oceanic navigation, which shall be profitable to Nicaragua and
                            equally open to the United States and to all other maritime nations.</p>
                        <p>You go to Nicaragua in this fortunate conjuncture of circumstances. There
                            is yet another comfort attending your mission. Claims of American
                            citizens upon the government of Nicaragua have long been a source of
                            diplomatic irritation. A convention which provides for the settlement of
                            these claims has been already negotiated. It wants only the consent of
                            the Senate of the United States to an amendment proposed by Nicaragu,
                            which, it is believed, would not materially change the effect of the
                            convention, and such consent may, therefore, be expected to be given at
                            the approaching special session of Congress.</p>
                        <p>Your instructions, therefore, will be few and very simple. Assure the
                            republic of Nicaragua that the President will deal with that government
                            justly, fairly, and in the most friendly spirit; that he desires only
                            its welfare and prosperity. Cultivate friendly dispositions there toward
                            the United States. See that no partiality arises in behalf of any other
                            foreign state to our prejudice, and favor, in every way you can, the
                            improvement of the transit route, seeking only such facilities for our
                            commerce as Nicaragua can afford profitably to herself, and yield, at
                            the same time, to other commercial nations.</p>
                        <p>Let unpleasant memories of past differences be buried, and let Nicaragua
                            be encouraged to rely on the sympathy and support of the United States
                            if she shall at any time come to need them.</p>

                            the viceroy arrived at the United States consulate with the state
                            carriage, in which, together with our vice-consul, Mr. Johnson, I was
                            conveyed to the palace built by the late Mohammed Ali on the sea-shore.
                            We were also accompanied by a cavalcade of guards and janizaries
                            attached to the other consulates at Alexandria. As we entered the
                            court-yard the troops were drawn up in a line, with quite a fine effect,
                            on our right, and we were greeted with the vigorous music of a military
                            band.</p>
                        <p>Passing up the steps of the palace, and between the numerous attendants
                            and officers who stood in order on each side, I was welcomed by the
                            minister of foreign affairs, and by him presented to the viceroy, who
                            advanced towards the centre of the spacious hall of reception. I then
                            addressed him as follows:</p>
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">Your Highness</hi>: I have the honor to present
                                to your highness a letter of credence from the President of the
                                United States, announcing that I have been duly appointed to be the
                                consul general of the United States for Egypt and its
                                dependencies.</p>
                            <p>“In thus accrediting me as a diplomatic agent, the President desires
                                me to assure your highness of his cordial friendship, and of his
                                satisfaction in the continuance of those amicable relations which
                                have so long and so happily subsisted between the governments of
                                your highness and of the United States.</p>
                            <p>“During my official residence it will be my pleasant duty, acting in
                                harmony with these assurances of the President, to use all honorable
                                means to protect the interests of my fellow-citizens, and at the
                                same time to foster a good understanding between them and the
                                subjects of your highness. May these purposes receive your
                                highnesses benevolent approval.”</p>
                        </quote>

                        <p>In accepting my credentials, his highness replied, in French, that he
                            perfectly understood and was much pleased with what I had said; that he
                            welcomed me to Egypt, and hoped that his relations with the United
                            States woud be as agreeable hereafter as they had been in times
                            past.</p>
                        <p>The viceroy then invited me to the divan, where we sat holding a few
                            minutes of informal conversation, with the usual accompaniment of pipes
                            and coffee. His highness was in his most affable humor. He hoped that
                            Egypt would prove agreeable to me, though I might find it very different
                            from the United States. Here in Egypt, he remarked, things go on very
                            smoothly. I replied, in so far as things went smoothly, I trusted the
                            United States would be able to imitate the government of his highness.
                            The viceroy laughed, and then proceeding from gay to grave, mentioned
                            the melancholy tidings he had heard the night before of the Sultan’s
                            death. I responded that I lamented the sad event, but was very glad,
                            nevertheless, that the viceroy was in excellent health. His highness,
                            whose domains are but nominally a dependency of the Sultan’s, seemed to
                            take pleasure in this compliment. To the suggestion that a voyage to the
                            United States in one of the excellent steam yachts of his navy might be
                            interesting to him, the viceroy answered that he could not leave his
                            country for so long a time. This, I assured him, was the worst
                            disability under which his highness labored. The viceroy made no
                            explicit reference to the present domestic disturbances in the United
                            States, but expressed his good wishes for the welfare and harmony of our
                            government.</p>
                        <p>I was next invested with “the sabre of honor,” and returned home,
                            escorted in the state carriage as before. Immediately on my reception by
                            the viceroy a salvo of cannon had been fired, and at the signal, the
                            national flags of all the fifteen consulates in Alexandria were raised
                            for the day in compliment to the occasion. A horse, handsomely
                            caparisoned, awaited me as I left the palace, and was led to the
                            consulate as the gift of the viceroy. The uniform usage in Egypt makes
                            this present so essential a part of a first official reception by the
                            viceroy, that the refusal of it would be deemed ungracious, and our
                            government, in the case of all my predecessors, has permitted its
                            acceptance. As the oriental custom on such occasions made it necessary
                            for me to disburse a considerable sum of money in gratuities to the very
                            numerous soldiers and servants of the viceroy, his gift may be regarded
                            as in some degree reciprocated. The pecuniary value of the horse is by
                            no means large.</p>
                        <p>On returning to the consulate I found the military band of the viceroy
                            stationed in front, who continued their complimentary services during
                            the whole day. The consuls general of other nations, and the viceroy’s
                            minister for foreign affairs, then called upon me, appearing in full
                            uniform; and in the afternoon I returned their visits, paying my
                            respects first to the minister. By the minister and by the consuls a
                            deep and intelligent interest was manifested in the affairs of the
                            United States, and warm wishes were expressed for the continuance of our
                            Union. The vigor of our government, and the vastness, suddenness, and
                            spontaneous character of the military movement of our people in the
                            pending struggle for national integrity, seem to have filled them with
                            surprise. Indeed, among all well-informed men here, as well as elsewhere
                            abroad, the historic battle fields of Europe have paled in interest
                            before the tremendous uprising of the great nation beyond the Atlantic.
                            They almost forget the political complications nearer home in studying
                            the military map of the United States. The book-shops of the principal
                            transatlantic cities abound in maps, charts, and other publications
                            illustrative of the American contest, and the United States will become
                            to masses, hitherto ignorant of its geography, a ground more familiar
                            than <pb n="423" xml:id="pg_423" facs="0423"/> were India and the Crimea
                            when the progress of armies made their localities significant to the
                            whole world.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Haywood, secretary of the Manchester Cotton Supply Association, is
                            expected here daily on a mission to Egypt and India, relative to the
                            prospective deficiency of cotton produced by the pending conflict in the
                            United States.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Haywood, while here, will endeavor to induce the Egyptian government
                            to extend the cultivation of cotton. It is believed that the crop in
                            Egypt could be increased tenfold if the government would tender its aid.
                            Carelessness in allowing the small canals of irrigation to be obstructed
                            is said to be a cause of the comparative meagreness of the average yield
                            of this important staple.</p>
                        <p>This year, owing to the unusual height of the last overflow of the Nile,
                            the crop promises to exceed considerably that which preceded it. In
                            expectation of a scarcity in England, some of the commercial houses of
                            Alexandria are sending agents into the interior to buy up the cotton in
                            advance of harvest. But so well understood is the condition of the
                            cotton growing region in the United States, even by the poorest fellahs,
                            (peasants,) that it is difficult to persuade them to sell on terms which
                            heretofore they would have been delighted to accept. The ruling price,
                            at the last quotations, of Mako, which ranks next to Sea Island cotton,
                            is 275 piastres ($13 75) per cantar (a quintal;) but some of the largest
                            cotton growers insist on $17 00, and are holding back for that unheard
                            of figure.</p>
                        <p>The following information is derived from intelligent men whose business
                            connexions in Egpyt give authority to their statements in reference to
                            this important question. I also communicate some tabular statistics
                            which are appended to this despatch.</p>
                        <p>The cotton crop of Egypt commences to be gathered about the middle of
                            September. There are two qualities, the Sea Island and the Mako.</p>
                        <p>The Sea Island cottons are divided into two kinds. The first is that of
                            which the seed is new, and which is sown for the first time in Egypt.
                            The second is that which has been sown for the second time. The Sea
                            Island, after the second planting, are changed into fine Mako.</p>
                        <p>The Mako are divided into three kinds, which in commerce are called fine
                            quality, medium quality, and inferior quality.</p>
                        <p>It is very difficult to give an exact statement of the number of quintals
                            which Egypt annually produces. But, according to the official tables of
                            exports, the total amount of crop is valued, on an average yearly, at
                            from four hundred and sixty thousand to five hundred and fifty thousand,
                            divided as follows: <pb n="424" xml:id="pg_424" facs="0424"/>

                        <p>The tabular results of the last six months indicate that England will
                            absorb a far larger proportion of Egyptian cotton than heretofore.</p>
                        <p>As before remarked, a favorable expectation prevails respecting the new
                            crop, because the waters of the Nile have now almost reached the level
                            of the same period last year. But this expectation may fail, for the
                            goodness of the crop depends, not solely on the overflow of the Nile,
                            but also on the winds, which are more or less auspicious at the time of
                            the efflorescence of the pods.</p>
                        <p>Thus far the disturbances in America, which have produced various
                            fluctuations in the price of cotton, have not as yet caused an increase
                            of more than two dollars (40 piastres) per quintal.</p>
                        <p>An informal application has been made to me in behalf of various Greek
                            and Italian residents of Alexandria, who desire to enlist in the
                            military service of the United States, if means shall be furnished to
                            transport them thither. I replied that I should, while appreciating
                            their benevolent wishes to our country, await instructions from my
                            government before giving them any encouragement.</p>
                        <p>The 4th of July, in Alexandria, was observed in the usual manner. The
                            flags of all the fifteen consulates were raised for the day. The
                            minister of <pb n="425" xml:id="pg_425" facs="0425"/> foreign affairs of
                            the Egyptian government also paid me his annual visit in honor of the
                            occasion, during which he expressed his wishes for the permanence of our
                            Union, and his opinion of the hopelessness of the cause of its domestic
                            enemies. He appeared quite astonished at the magnitude and efficiency of
                            our military operations.</p>
                        <p>At a dinner, given by the vice-consul in honor of the day, which was
                            attended by the consul general of the kingdom of Italy and other
                            distinguished residents of the city, the occasion was enthusiastically
                            commemorated.</p>

                                the honor to inform your excellency that, in consequence of the
                                President of the so-called “Confederated States of America” having
                                issued a proclamation announcing that he has been empowered and is
                                prepared to issue letters of marque to all who are willing to enter
                                the service of the said States as privateers, he, the undersigned,
                                has been instructed by his government to be vigilant to the extent
                                of his power to prevent vessels from being fitted out in the ports
                                of Chili under the authority of the said “Confederated States.” The
                                government of the undersigned, denying the right of the States
                                composing the so-called “Confederated States of America” to secede,
                                as they have done, from the American Union, and maintaining that the
                                people of the States which have so seceded still owe fealty to the
                                Constitution and laws of the United States, has determined to
                                enforce obedience thereto on the part of the whole people thereof,
                                and has solemnly proclaimed and declared that any person who shall,
                                “under the pretended authority of the Confederated States, or under
                                any other pretence, molest a vessel of the United States, or the
                                persons or cargo on board of her, such person will be held amenable
                                to the laws of the United States for the prevention and punishment
                                of piracy.”</p>
                            <p>Information has recently been communicated to the undersigned of such
                                a character and from such sources as to induce the belief on his
                                part that there are now, or have very recently been, in Chili
                                parties endeavoring to effect a purchase of munitions of war to be
                                used in fitting out privateers for the service of the so-called
                                “Confederated States of America.”</p>
                            <p>Although the undersigned cannot vouch for the correctness of this
                                information, <pb n="430" xml:id="pg_430" facs="0430"/> he can assure
                                your excellency that he regards the same of sufficient importance,
                                in view of the before-mentioned instructions of his government, to
                                require him to inform your excellency thereof, and to very
                                respectfully suggest to your excellency’s government to adopt such
                                measures as it may deem advisable to secure vigilance on the part of
                                the proper officials to prevent the fitting out of privateers in the
                                ports of Chili with a view of committing assaults upon the lives and
                                property of citizens of his country engaged in lawful commerce.</p>
                            <p>In conclusion, the undersigned begs to add that he has directed
                                inquiries to be made at the different ports in Chili, and that he
                                will promptly impart to your excellency’s government any important
                                facts relating to the object of this note which may hereafter come
                                to his knowledge.</p>

                            dated the 31st ultimo, which your excellency was pleased to address me.
                            In it your excellency <pb n="431" xml:id="pg_431" facs="0431"/> informs
                            me that you have received instructions from your government to endeavor
                            to impede, as far as your powers will permit, that in the ports of Chili
                            privateers be armed for the service of the States which have recently
                            declined to recognize the authority of the government of the Union, and
                            have constituted themselves under a <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi>
                            government, with the title of Confederated States of
                            America—instructions given to your excellency in consequence of a recent
                            proclamation of the President of these States, wherein he announces that
                            he is empowered and prepared to issue letters of marque.</p>
                        <p>At the same time your excellency informs me that you have recently
                            received information inducing you to believe that there are at present,
                            or recently have been, in Chili, persons endeavoring to purchase
                            munitions of war, in order to employ the same in arming privateers for
                            the service of the said Confederated States of America; and in view, of
                            this information your excellency signifies to me a desire that my
                            government adopt such measures as it may deem expedient, in order to
                            prevent the fitting out of such privateers in the ports of the
                            republic.</p>
                        <p>I must assure your excellency, in reply, that my government, complying
                            with the duties which it owes to a friendly state, is disposed to
                            prevent preparations of warlike character, or any other operations
                            hostile to the United States, from being effected in any port whatever
                            of the territory of the republic; and that consequently the necessary
                            orders will be given to the respective authorities to keep especial
                            watch in this particular. However, as far as regards privateering
                            expeditions which may prepare or arm themselves on the coasts of Chili,
                            it might happen in many cases that the zeal and vigilance of the
                            authorities might prove inefficacious to discover them; so that it is to
                            be desired that whatever news your excellency might obtain on the
                            subject, you would have the kindness to transmit the same to me, in
                            order that I might, in view thereof, issue the most opportune
                            instructions to frustrate the carrying out of such expeditions.</p>
                        <p>In the mean time will your excellency be pleased to accept the assurances
                            of my distinguished consideration, with which I remain your excellency’s

                        <p>I have not been able yet to obtain from the Hawaiian government such a
                            proclamation as I desired upon the subject of privateering, or the
                            permission to enter the ports of this kingdom of any suspicious
                            vessels.</p>
                        <p>The King and a portion of his counsellors are sojourning on the island of
                            Hawaii during the summer months. Copies of the President’s proclamation
                            in relation to blockade of southern ports, together with the despatches
                            from the Department of State accompanying them, have been furnished to
                            the minister of foreign relations, since which. I have had several
                            interviews with that minister relative to the policy of this government
                            towards privateering, and the occupancy of their ports by privateering
                            vessels or prizes which might be captured by them.</p>

                                copies of two despatches from the Hon. William H. Seward, Secretary
                                of State of the United States, and of two proclamations (April 19
                                and April 27, 1861) issued by his excellency Abraham Lincoln,
                                President of the United States, announcing the blockade of the ports
                                of several of the southern States, and making known that all persons
                                acting under the pretended authority of the aforesaid southern
                                States, or under any pretence whatever, who shall molest vessels of
                                the United States or their cargoes, shall be considered and dealt
                                with as pirates.</p>
                            <p>You will observe, by a perusal of the copy of Mr. Seward’s despatch
                                to me of the 20th April, 1861, that I am instructed to be vigilant
                                in preventing aggressions upon American commerce by vessels or
                                persons acting under the pretended authority mentioned.</p>
                            <p>To this end I would respectfully call your attention to the fact that
                                the American clipper ship Bald Eagle, bound from San Francisco to
                                China, with a large amount of treasure on board, having been chased,
                                on her passage to this group, by a suspicious vessel, and to
                                officially inquire of you what course his Hawaiian Majesty’s
                                government intends to pursue with, regard to vessels of this
                                description found frequenting the King’s waters, or touching for
                                supplies or repairs at any of the ports in his Majesty’s
                                dominions.</p>

                                receipt of your despatch of the 24th instant, with its four
                                enclosures, which you did me the great favor of delivering
                                personally, along with verbal explanations, for which I beg to thank
                                you in the name of the King’s government.</p>
                            <p>By your despatch and its enclosures I am informed that the honorable
                                Secretary of State, William H. Seward, apprehensive lest, “under the
                                pretended authority of the so-called Confederate States of America,”
                                privateers might be fitted out in the ports of this kingdom for the
                                purpose of aggression on the commerce of the United States,
                                instructed you, on the 20th of April last, to be vigilant in
                                preventing any such unlawful purpose; to make known to the proper
                                authorities of this government the proclamations issued by the
                                President; impart to them all facts upon the subject which might
                                come to your knowledge; and to ascertain from the King’s government,
                                officially, what course they intended to pursue with regard to
                                vessels of that description frequenting the King’s waters, or
                                touching for supplies or repairs at any of the ports in his
                                Majesty’s dominions; all which instructions you carried out very
                                fully, and with great courtesy, in your precited despatch, and in
                                the facts, no less important to the United States than to this
                                kingdom, which you were pleased to impart to me verbally on the
                                occasion of its delivery.</p>
                            <p>In reply, I have the honor to refer you to the proclamation of the
                                late King of 16th May, 1854, asserting his neutral rights within the
                                whole extent of his jurisdiction, declaring all captures and
                                seizures made within that jurisdiction to be unlawful, and
                                prohibiting his subjects from engaging, either directly or
                                indirectly, in privateering, under the penalty of being treated and
                                punished as pirates; to the resolution of his late Majesty, in privy
                                council of 15th June, 1854, prohibiting the sale of prizes within
                                his jurisdiction, and to the resolution of his late Majesty, in
                                privy council of the 17th July of the same year, prohibiting all
                                privateers, and prizes made by them, from entering the ports of this
                                kingdom, unless in such circumstances of distress that their
                                exclusion would involve a sacrifice of life, and then only under
                                special permission of the King, after proof to his Majesty’s
                                satisfaction of such circumstances of distress; copies of all which
                                you will find in your archives, for they were duly passed at the
                                time to the Hon. David L. Gregg for his own and the information of
                                his government.</p>
                            <p>I have the honor to enclose copy of the reply of the honorable judges
                                of the supreme court, dated yesterday, in reply to my letters to
                                them of the 5th, 10th, 13th, and 24th instant, from which you will
                                see that, in their opinion, the said proclamation and resolutions
                                are in accordance with the rights of the King, and with his
                                Majesty’s duties as a neutral sovereign to the United States; and
                                that under the same neither can privateers be fitted out in the
                                ports of this kingdom, nor can its ports be used as a depot for the
                                spoils or the prisoners made by privateers.</p>
                            <p>Therefore it only remains for me to make known to the King, who is at
                                Kailua, your despatch and its enclosures, also the opinion of his
                                Majesty’s judges of the supreme court, and to suggest to his Majesty
                                that he be pleased to issue a proclamation revalidating the
                                aforesaid proclamation and resolutions, with an order that copies of
                                such proclamation be published in the Polynesian, and served
                                immediately by the pilots or harbor master upon any belligerent
                                vessel that may appear in his Majesty’s waters, until the conclusion
                                of the civil war now unhappily devastating the United States.</p>
                            <p>You can assure the honorable Secretary of State of your government
                                that <pb n="435" xml:id="pg_435" facs="0435"/> the King, knowing
                                well his obligations and responsibilities to the United States under
                                the law of nations and the existing treaty, will neglect no means to
                                fulfil them to the utmost extent of his power; but destitute as you
                                know him to be of either army, navy, or forts, that power is only
                                    <hi rend="italic">moral</hi>, and if armed vessels should enter
                                his waters, disregarding alike his neutral rights and the law of
                                nations, captures might be made within his jurisdiction contrary to
                                his proclamation, and in spite of all the efforts that he could make
                                to prevent them.</p>
                            <p>Therefore I repeat what I had the honor to state to you verbally,
                                that in a port where many millions of value in American whaleships,
                                oil and bone, and in merchant vessels, are often to be found, and
                                which might be captured or burnt by one strong privateer, in
                                defiance of all the King’s forces, it is of urgent necessity that
                                Honolulu should not be left without the presence of a vessel-of-war
                                of the United States of sufficient power to deter any such privateer
                                from committing aggressions on the ships or property of the citizens
                                of the United States within the King’s jurisdiction. I was happy to
                                understand from you that you had not neglected to make such a
                                recommendation to your government.</p>
                            <p>In conclusion, let me assure you that in this and every other
                                international matter it will afford me the utmost pleasure to confer
                                and concert with you with all that frankness and confidence that,
                                according to Martens and other publicists, ought to exist between a
                                foreign representative and the minister of foreign affairs of the
                                country to which he is accredited and sent; but more especially be
                                assured of the high respect and very distinguished consideration
                                with which I have the honor to be, sir, your most obedient, humble
                                servant,</p>

                                enclosures. The justices of the supreme court have examined the
                                proclamation issued by her Britannic Majesty the Queen, and also the
                                proclamation issued by the President of the United States, issued in
                                consequence of hostilities having arisen between the government of
                                the United States and certain States styling themselves the
                                Confederate States of America, together with the communication of
                                the Secretary of State, Mr. Seward, and the commissioner of the
                                United States at this court accompanying them.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Seward is apprehensive that efforts may be made to fit out
                                privateers in our ports for the purpose of aggression on American
                                commerce. To permit it would unquestionably be a breach of
                                neutrality and in derogation of our duty; neither can our ports be
                                used as a depot for the spoils or the prisoners of privateers.</p>
                            <p>We have also examined the proclamation issued in 1854 by his Majesty
                                the King, proclaiming neutrality in the war then pending between the
                                great maritime powers of Europe, and the resolutions of the privy
                                council which accompanied it, and we are of opinion that similar
                                declarations at this time will be in accordance with our rights and
                                duties as neutrals.</p>
                            <p>I beg to return to you the enclosures which accompanied your
                                communications.</p>
                            <p>I have the honor to be, sir, your most obedient servants,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: It is my unpleasant duty to inform you
                            that a daring and murderous attack was made on the British legation in
                            this city on the night of the 5th instant.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Alcock providentially escaped uninjured, but Mr. Oliphant, secretary
                            of legation, and Mr. Morrison, consul for Nagasaki, were wounded. Four
                            of the assailants were killed, and two wounded were made prisoners. Of
                            the Japanese defenders of Mr. Alcock three were killed and fifteen
                            wounded.</p>
                        <p>For full details of this bloody affair I beg to refer you to the
                            following enclosures: <list>
                                <item>No. 1, Mr. Alcock to Mr. Harris, July 6.</item>

                                    8.</item>

                            </list></p>
                        <p>The Japanese were evidently taken by surprise, but they soon recovered
                            from it and fought with great bravery, and at last beat off the
                            assailants.</p>
                        <p>This is the first instance in which a blow has been struck in defence of
                            a foreigner in this country, and may be considered as proof of the
                            desire of this government to give us protection.</p>
                        <p>I consider the present as a crisis in the foreign affairs of Japan, for
                            if the government is too weak to punish the instigators and agents of
                            this nefarious affair, it may be believed that it will lead to some very
                            decided action on the part of the English government, for the outrage
                            was too great to be overlooked.</p>
                        <p>There is a party in this country who are opposed to the presence of any
                            foreigners in Japan, and, in addition to this, there is a very strong
                            dislike to the English in particular, which feeling seems to attach
                            especially to Mr. Alcock. He was absent from this city for some three
                            months, during which time the utmost quiet prevailed; yet within
                            thirty-six hours after his return the attack in question was made on
                            him.</p>
                        <p>I am happy to say that these prejudices do not extend to our citizens in
                            this country, and I think that I am personally popular among all classes
                            of the Japanese. Yet it must not be concealed from you that I am, in
                            common with my colleagues, subject to the same unpopularity, that
                            attaches to the presence of all foreigners in Japan</p>
                        <p>I have requested the ministers for foreign affairs to give me an
                            interview on the 11th instant, and I shall then endeavor to place before
                            them, in a forcible manner, the great danger that will arise from any
                            want of firm action on their part at this juncture.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Last night between eleven and twelve
                                o’clock the British legation was suddenly attacked, and an entrance
                                effected at several points simultaneously by armed bands of
                                Japanese, said to be Loonins, and by others, Prince of Mito’s men.
                                Two of the members of the establishment, Mr. Oliphant and Mr.
                                Morrison, were met in a passage and both wounded; the first, I am
                                sorry to say, very severely, when a momentary diverson was effected
                                by a shot from Mr. Morrison’s revolver, which appears to have taken
                                effect. A few minutes later the same or another division of the
                                assassins sought to effect an entrance to the apartments occupied by
                                myself, by breaking through and hacking in pieces some glass doors
                                opening into another suite, having mistaken their way. To this
                                alone, under Providence, we probably owe our lives, for several
                                minutes were thus lost to them; at the end of which the Yaconins or
                                Dainios guards appeared to have come to the spot, and the assailants
                                were finally driven out of the house, after having penetrated into
                                nearly every room except my own, leaving traces of their presence by
                                slashing at all the beds and furniture. Marks of blood-were found in
                                various directions, and a prolonged conflict took place outside, in
                                the avenue and approaches to the legation, with the officers and men
                                on service.</p>
                            <p>Such a deed of atrocity, perpetrated in the capital of a government
                                to which foreign representatives are accredited by the western
                                powers, needs no comment. I only feel it a duty to communicate to my
                                colleagues the facts for their guidance and information, and to
                                acquaint them that, as a temporary measure, I have ordered up her
                                Majesty’s ship “Ringdove,” and caused a guard of men to be landed.
                                What measures it may be expedient to adopt for future security of
                                this and the other legations in Yedo, and the maintenance of those
                                international rights and immunities so grievously attacked, becomes
                                a serious consideration, and one the pressing importance of which
                                cannot well be overlooked. But on this part of the subject I shall
                                be glad to enter into further communication with you and the rest of
                                my colleagues, should you feel disposed to favor me with your
                                views.</p>

                            <p>I am informed by Mr. Alcock, the British envoy, that an attempt was
                                made on the night of the 5th instant to assassinate him and the
                                persons attached to the British legation in this city. I am further
                                informed that the house was broken into at the same moment of time
                                in three different places; <pb n="439" xml:id="pg_439" facs="0439"/>
                                and that, during the contest, two persons in her Britannic Majesty’s
                                service were wounded.</p>
                            <p>This makes the seventh attack on foreigners within the period of two
                                years; and in five of the attempts murder was committed. Up to this
                                day not one person has been punished for these atrocious crimes. You
                                have frequently assured me that you were making constant efforts to
                                arrest these criminals, but that you were unable to discover
                                them.</p>
                            <p>In the present case evidence is in your possession to enable you to
                                arrest the persons concerned in the last atrocious attempt at
                                murder, for you have made a prisoner of one of the men, and you have
                                a pocket-book found on the ground which contains a list of the names
                                of fourteen of the party; and these two sources of evidence will
                                enable you to arrest and bring to condign punishment the whole of
                                the gang. I feel it my duty to say to you that, in my opinion, your
                                failure to arrest and punish the perpetrators of previous criminal
                                acts has encouraged the present horrible attempt to take the life of
                                Mr. Alcock.</p>
                            <p>I have given you too many evidences of my friendship for you to doubt
                                my good will; and as your friend, who earnestly wishes to see Japan
                                peaceful, prosperous, and happy, I now say to you, that if you do
                                not promptly arrest and punish the authors of this last deed of
                                blood, that the most lamentable consequences to your country will
                                inevitably ensue; for if you do not punish these men, it will show
                                that you do not wish to do so. I urge you earnestly to consider this
                                friendly and serious warning.</p>
                            <p>I propose to have an interview with you in a few days, at which time
                                I will enter more largely into details than I can do in a
                                letter.</p>
                            <p>Stated with respect and courtesy.</p>

                                receipt of your letter of the 6th instant, giving me the particulars
                                of an attack made the previous night, by a band of Japanese
                                assassins, on her Britannic Majesty’s legation, and informing me
                                that Mr. Oliphant, secretary of her Britannic Majesty’s legation,
                                and Mr. Morrison, consul for Nagasaki, were wounded in the melee
                                which ensued, and adding the gratifying intelligence that you had,
                                providentially, escaped any bodily injury.</p>
                            <p>I cannot conceal from you the horror and indignation which the
                                atrocious attempt on your life excites in my mind, exceeding, as it
                                does, in the boldness of its design and in the extent of its
                                intended slaughter, all previous essays of the kind.</p>
                            <p>In the nineteen months that followed the residence of the foreign
                                representatives in this city, six distinct outrages were perpetrated
                                on the persons of foreigners. Yet, up to this day, not one of the
                                persons engaged in those criminal acts has been made to answer for
                                his crime. The Japanese ministers have reiterated the assurance of
                                their anxious desire to arrest and punish the <pb n="440"
                                    xml:id="pg_440" facs="0440"/> offenders in question, but have
                                declared their inability to identify them. In the present case no
                                such plea can be set up, for two of your assailants are prisoners,
                                and a pocket-book found on the ground near your legation contains a
                                list of fourteen of the gang. With these two sources of information
                                in their possession, there cannot be any difficulty in ascertaining
                                the names of the whole band, and their consequent arrest and
                                punishment.</p>
                            <p>Should this government fail in its duty in the present case, it will
                                be almost conclusive that it is either unable or unwilling to give
                                us that protection which the punishment of crime would secure by the
                                repression of criminal designs, and it will then become a matter of
                                serious consideration what line of conduct should be adopted to
                                secure to us those rights which we have guaranteed to us by our
                                solemn treaty stipulations.</p>
                            <p>I have addressed a letter to the Japanese ministers for foreign
                                affairs in the sense of the foregoing, and I have pointedly shown
                                them that any failure on their part at the present crisis will
                                greatly endanger the peace of their country.</p>
                            <p>I propose to have an interview with the ministers in this behalf,
                                when I intend to urge upon them the necessity that exists for their
                                action in this matter.</p>
                            <p>In this connexion I beg to say that if you intend to have an
                                interview with the ministers shortly, I will defer mine until after
                                yours has taken place.</p>
                            <p>I renew to you my cordial congratulations on your truly providential
                                escape from a daring and almost successful attempt on your life.</p>
                            <p>I have the honor to be, sir, your most obedient humble servant,</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have to thank you for the
                                congratulations of escape from the assassins, conveyed in your
                                letter of this date, and the expression of your views upon the
                                present conjuncture, in which I am glad to say there is a general
                                accordance with my own.</p>
                            <p>If there be any divergence, it is in the absence of all hope on my
                                part that the Japanese government will behave otherwise on this than
                                on every former occasion of the like nature. They have shown great
                                supineness and indifference hitherto, and appear wholly unconscious
                                of the gravity of the circumstances and the atrocious nature of the
                                outrage offered to the flag.</p>
                            <p>I had proposed seeing the ministers to-morrow, but since the event of
                                the 5th I have thought it better to wait an answer to a letter which
                                I addressed them, urging them to give such full satisfaction as
                                should relieve them of all charge of complicity or indifference.</p>
                            <p>I expect Admiral Hope here also in a few days, which may further
                                induce me to postpone an interview. If you wish to see the
                                ministers, therefore, I beg I may not be a cause of delay.</p>
                            <p>I have the honor to be, sir, your most obedient humble servant,</p>

                            has been received.</p>
                        <p>The assaults committed upon the minister of Great Britain and the other
                            members of that legation, in violation of express treaty, of the laws of
                            nations, and of the principles of common humanity, have excited a deep
                            concern on the part of the President.</p>
                        <p>Your prompt, earnest, and decided proceedings in aid of the just desire
                            of her Britannic Majesty’s minister to obtain adequate satisfaction for
                            that outrage meet his emphatic approval. I have lost no time in assuring
                            the British government directly of the willingness of the United States
                            to co-operate with it in any judicious measure it may suggest to insure
                            safety hereafter to diplomatic and consular representatives of the
                            western powers in Japan, with due respect to the sovereignties in whose
                            behalf their exposure to such grave perils is incurred.</p>
