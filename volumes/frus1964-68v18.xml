                <p>Since 1861, the Department of State's documentary series <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> has constituted the official
                    record of the foreign policy and diplomacy of the United States. Historians in
                    the Office of the Historian collect, arrange, and annotate the principal
                    documents comprising the record of American foreign policy. The standards for
                    the preparation of the series and the general deadlines for its publication are
                    established by the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi>
                    statute of October 28, 1991 (22 USC 4351, et seq.). Volumes in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series are published when all the
                    necessary editing, declassification, and printing steps have been completed.</p>
                <p>The documents in this volume are drawn from the centralized indexed files of the
                    Department of State and the decentralized Bureau, Office, and other lot files of
                    the relevant Departmental units. The volume also includes records from the
                    Department of Defense and the Central Intelligence Agency. In addition, the
                    editor made extensive use of the Presidential and other papers at the <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B. Johnson</persName> Library in Austin, Texas.
                    Access to the recordings of President Johnson's telephone conversations at the
                    Johnson Library resulted in the inclusion of transcripts or summaries of

                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Overview</p>
                <p>President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B. Johnson</persName> sought to
                    continue his predecessor John F. Kennedy's policy of pursuing good relations
                    with Gamal Abdul Nasser's Egypt, then called the United Arab Republic (<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>), while maintaining good relations with Israel.
                    Keeping the Arab-Israeli dispute “in the icebox” was central to this approach.
                    Mounting tensions in the area, fueled by terrorist attacks on Israel and the
                    flow of Soviet arms to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, undermined this
                    policy. The administration reluctantly agreed to provide increasingly
                    sophisticated arms to Israel and Jordan. U.S. relations with the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> cooled, as <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                    intervention in Yemen and <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s vocal
                    criticism of U.S. policies annoyed Johnson and stirred Congressional opposition
                    to U.S. economic aid. Still, the administration tried to take an even-handed
                    approach to the Arab-Israeli dispute, to prevent a buildup of advanced weapons
                    in the area, and to prevent the increasingly frequent incidents on Israel's
                    borders from flaring into armed conflict. The volume concludes on the brink of
                    the crisis that preceded the Six-Day War.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Question of Arms for Israel and Jordan</p>
                <p>As the year 1964 began, Israel launched an intensive effort to obtain modern U.S.
                    tanks to counterbalance Soviet-equipped <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                    forces. The request ran counter to established U.S. policy to avoid becoming a
                    major arms supplier to either side in the Arab-Israeli dispute. Although the
                    Kennedy administration had diverged from the policy with its 1962 sale of Hawk
                    missiles to Israel, Johnson administration officials were reluctant to depart
                    further from it. While there was much sympathy for Israel's request within the
                    administration, as well as awareness of the domestic political benefits of
                    providing the tanks in an election year, there was also concern over the likely
                    Arab reaction and the impact of a sale on U.S. interests in the Near East and
                    influence in the Arab world. (3, 7, 10, 13, 28, 29, 42)</p>
                <p>After an interdepartmental review, the National Security Council Standing Group
                    agreed that the anticipated Arab reaction precluded a direct U.S. tank sale to
                    Israel, but that the United States should assist Israel in obtaining British,
                    French, or German tanks. White House aide <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Myer
                        Feldman</persName> was dispatched to Tel Aviv to tell the Israelis that the
                    United States would not sell tanks directly but would help them obtain tanks
                    from Europe. (47, 48, 54–57) When Israel's Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Levi Eshkol</persName> visited Washington in June 1964,
                    Johnson told him the United States would help Israel in every way possible to
                    obtain British and German tanks at an affordable price. (64, 65) Subsequently, a
                    complicated arrangement was worked out in which Israel would purchase U.S. tanks
                    from Germany, with modernization kits to be supplied by the United States,
                    supplemented by British tanks. The German tank deal was contingent on secrecy.
                    (98)</p>
                <p>While the tank negotiations were still underway, a new request for U.S. arms came
                    from Jordan. <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">King Hussein</persName> informed the
                    Embassy that Jordan was under pressure from the Unified Arab Command (<gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss>), which had been created in January 1964 by an
                    Arab summit meeting, to expand Jordanian military forces and introduce Soviet
                    equipment, including tanks and a squadron of supersonic fighters. Hussein had
                    told the <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> that Jordan could obtain U.S.
                    equipment, but if the United States would not provide it, he would be under
                    irresistible pressure to accept Soviet aircraft. (77) The request, especially
                    the request for supersonic aircraft, posed a difficult problem. A sale to Jordan
                    would lead to enormous pressure to sell similar equipment to Israel, with the
                    inevitable Arab reaction, but the administration considered the alternative of a
                    Soviet presence in Jordan unacceptable. (79, 80, 90, 115)</p>
                <p>At an <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> meeting in February 1965, President
                    Johnson and his advisers agreed that a tank sale to Jordan was necessary but
                    that they should try to persuade <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">King
                        Hussein</persName> to forego supersonics or buy Western European planes.
                    (128) Meanwhile, <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> was informed of
                    the pending U.S. tank sale to Jordan and the likelihood of Jordan's acquisition
                    of supersonic jets. His strongly negative reply increased Johnson's concern
                    about domestic reaction to the sale of arms to Jordan and persuaded U.S.
                    policymakers that it would be necessary to reverse the policy against direct
                    arms sales to Israel. (135, 136, 138)</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Harriman-Komer Mission</p>
                <p>In February 1965 Johnson sent Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs W.
                    Averell Harriman and <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> staffer <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Robert Komer</persName> to Tel Aviv with a package
                    proposal. The United States would consider direct arms sales to Israel on
                    favorable credit terms on a case-by-case basis. In return for this policy shift,
                    the Israeli Government would let its supporters in the United States know of its
                    acceptance of the U.S. arms sale to Jordan, pledge that it did not intend to
                    develop nuclear weapons, agree to inspection of its nuclear facilities by the
                    International Atomic Energy Agency (<gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>), and
                    agree that it would not take preemptive action against Arab projects for Jordan
                    River diversion but instead would take the problem to the United Nations.
                    (154)</p>
                <p>The Israelis soon discovered that <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName>
                    was asking for commitments on matters of vital interest to them but offering
                    only a promise to consider future sales on a case-by-case basis. (155–164) The
                    Israelis would not deny themselves a future nuclear option by accepting <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> controls, <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName> reported, nor would they completely forswear the
                    possibility of preemption on the water issue or promise to take the issue to the
                    United Nations, especially in exchange for a nebulous promise of possible future
                    arms. It would be possible to obtain some Israeli assurances, he thought, by
                    offering some arms sales, which were inevitable anyway. The German tank deal had
                    leaked, the German Government was backing away from it, and the administration
                    was virtually committed to provide the tanks that Israel had expected to obtain
                    from Germany. “In sum,” he cabled, “we [are] seven months pregnant on arms sales
                    to Israel as well as Jordan. If we sell to Jordan we must sell to Israel too. If
                    we don't sell to Jordan, Soviets will. Then we'll have to sell to Israel
                    anyway.” (165)</p>
                <p>Secretary of State Dean <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> cabled
                        <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> that he and the President
                    thought it was time for the Israeli Government to make some hard decisions.
                        <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> could tell them the United
                    States would replace the tanks if necessary, but apart from that, the Israelis
                    must accept the original package. (166) <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> replied with some asperity that all <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>'s points had been made to the point of
                    rudeness. <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName> supported this in a cable
                    to the President's Special Assistant for National Security Affairs <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">McGeorge Bundy</persName>, adding, “as <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> says, even Soviets are less tough
                    bargainers than Israelis.” (169) <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> told
                        <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> that he did not doubt the
                    forcefulness of Harriman's presentation but that his cable reflected the
                    President's feeling that “there are limits beyond which we cannot go in support
                    of Israel.” (168)</p>
                <p> Johnson then decided on another proposal. The U.S. Government would sell
                    military equipment comparable in quantities and kinds to what it sold to Jordan
                    but would regard such sales as an exception to its existing policy and not a
                    precedent for the future. In return, the Israeli Government would acknowledge
                    privately the need for U.S. arms sales to Jordan, pledge to utilize all peaceful
                    means concerning the Jordan water issue, and reiterate publicly that Israel
                    would not be the first country in the area to acquire or develop a nuclear
                    weapons capability. (172) The President had decided, <persName>Bundy</persName>
                    cabled <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName>, that since Israel was
                    unwilling to make firm undertakings not to develop nuclear weapons and to
                    refrain from preemptive attacks over Jordan water, the United States should not
                    accept a general open-ended commitment to supply arms to Israel. (178)</p>
                <p>After further negotiations between <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName>
                    and Israeli officials (<persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> had gone
                    on to other capitals), the two sides reached agreement on March 11. Israel
                    reaffirmed that it would not be the first to introduce nuclear weapons into the
                    area, and the United States reaffirmed its opposition to aggression in the area
                    and agreed to sell tanks equivalent to those sold to Jordan, tanks to complete
                    the German-Israeli tank deal if necessary, and up to 24 combat aircraft if
                    Israel could not obtain them from Western European sources. <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> assured <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName> privately of tacit Israeli acquiescence in the U.S. arms
                    sale to Jordan. (181, 182) A week later, the United States and Jordan reached
                    agreement on a U.S. sale of tanks and other equipment. (183, 185) A year later,
                    agreements were reached for the sale of 48 F–4s to Israel and 36 F–104s to
                    Jordan. (269, 274, 281)</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">U.S. Efforts at Near East Arms Control</p>
                <p>Both President Johnson and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>
                    were greatly worried about the threat of nuclear proliferation in the Near East.
                    U.S. officials had been concerned about Israel's nuclear program since a secret
                    Israeli nuclear facility at Dimona became public knowledge in 1960. The Israelis
                    refused to permit <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> inspection of Dimona,
                    but President Kennedy had obtained Israeli agreement for periodic visits to the
                    facility by U.S. teams of scientists. The Johnson administration continued to
                    insist on these visits. The visiting scientists found no evidence of an Israeli
                    atomic weapons program, but U.S. suspicions about Israeli intentions continued.
                    (12, 134, 175, 287, 389, 415) Johnson tried without success to obtain Israel's
                    agreement to <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> inspections of all its
                    nuclear facilities. (216, 229, 296, 330, 376)</p>
                <p>In addition to the pledge demanded of Israel at the time of the <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName> mission, U.S. officials continued to stress to the
                    Israelis the importance of the nuclear proliferation issue. At the time of the
                    F–4 sale in early 1966, the administration insisted on a reaffirmation of
                    Israel's pledge that it would not be the first to introduce nuclear weapons into
                    the area. Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Abba Eban</persName> told
                    Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">Robert S. McNamara</persName>
                    that Israel did not intend to build nuclear weapons, “so we will not use your
                    aircraft to carry weapons we haven't got and hope we will never have.” (269) A
                    few months later, <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> told an Israeli
                    envoy that the administration assumed Israel did not wish to go nuclear, and
                    that if it did, it would “lose U.S. support.” (311) When <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> told Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Walworth Barbour</persName> that this suggestion of sanctions was not in
                    accord with the atmosphere of trust that should prevail between good friends,
                        <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Barbour</persName> replied that it was not a
                    question of sanctions but of a loss of U.S. support. (321)</p>
                <p>Another Kennedy arms control initiative continued by the Johnson administration
                    was an effort to probe the possibility of an indirect arrangement to prevent the
                    introduction of advanced weapons by Israel and the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. Johnson dispatched U.S. officials for discussions with
                        <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> early in 1964 and wrote to
                        <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> inviting a letter affirming
                    his earlier statements that he had no intention of developing nuclear weapons.
                    In July 1964 Nasser sent Johnson such a letter. (24, 25, 51, 58, 85, 89) Johnson
                    then sent <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">John J. McCloy</persName>, who had
                    visited Cairo as Kennedy's emissary in June 1963, to Cairo in September 1964 to
                    discuss possible limitations on missiles. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s willingness to be cooperative on nuclear weapons did
                    not extend to missiles, of which he had a considerable supply. He told <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> the problem in the Middle East was not
                    missiles but Palestine; nothing could stop the arms race in the area except the
                    solution of the Israeli problem. (88, 95–97)</p>
                <p>Administration efforts to probe the possibility of a U.S.-Soviet agreement to
                    reduce the flow of arms to the area revealed no Soviet interest. Ambassador at
                    Large <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Llewellyn E. Thompson</persName> told Soviet
                    Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Anatoliy F. Dobrynin</persName> in
                    February 1966 that the Soviet supply of arms to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> added to the pressure on the United States to provide arms to
                    countries in the area. He asked whether an understanding not to sell
                    sophisticated weaponry such as supersonic planes or rockets to countries in the
                    area might be possible. (270) <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                    replied in the negative a few weeks later, instead suggesting the possibility of
                    a nuclear-free zone in the area. (278) <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> pursued this, suggesting to <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> that the United States and the Soviet Union might
                    obtain separate private assurances from countries in the area and then convey
                    them to their counterparts. He told <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> the United States was convinced the Israelis were not
                    planning to make nuclear weapons. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> appeared skeptical. (292)</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Deteriorating Relations With the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                </p>
                <p> Johnson initially sought to continue Kennedy's policy of trying to develop good
                    relations with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, although that
                    policy was already foundering on Congressional opposition to economic aid to the
                        <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s intervention in Yemen and for a time in the Congo, his
                    attacks on U.S. policy in Vietnam and other parts of the world, and the flow of
                    Soviet arms to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> engendered skepticism
                    about the policy not only in Congress but also within the administration. The
                    policy of trying to reach an understanding with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> had produced no benefits, <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> told the National Security Council in April 1964. (35)
                    Administration officials were unable to find a better alternative to this
                    policy, but legislative constraints and Johnson's own annoyance with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s policies limited U.S. economic aid,
                    the primary incentive they could offer <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>.</p>
                <p>In November 1964, a National Security Action Memorandum stipulated that all
                    recommendations on aid to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> should be sent
                    to the White House for the President's review. (106) Johnson was upset when
                        <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> agreed to continue P.L. 480
                    programs and other aid in the pipeline after a mob attack on the Embassy in
                    Cairo. (113, 115) Congress was on the verge of cutting off all P.L. 480 aid to
                    the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. It was important to get relations back
                    on an even keel, <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> told the President,
                    in order to end <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s intervention in
                    the Congo and prevent damage to U.S. interests and the growth of Soviet
                    influence in the Arab world. (123) Johnson and <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> argued successfully for legislation that would permit
                    carrying out the remaining commitments of the existing P.L. 480 agreement with
                    the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, provided the President certified it to
                    be in the national interest. Unofficially, members of Congress made it clear
                    that no aid should go to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> while its arms
                    shipments to the Congo continued. (125, 205)</p>
                <p>
                    <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> informed U.S. officials in April
                    1965 that <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> aid to rebels in the Congo had
                    ended. Two months later, Johnson released the last $37 million under the
                    existing P.L. 480 agreement. (206, 219, 223) <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                    intervention in Yemen continued, however, and <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> continued his periodic blasts at U.S. policies. In
                    September Congress adopted new legislation forbidding P.L. 480 aid to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> unless the President certified it essential to
                    the national interest. Soon afterward, <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> recommended offering the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> a new short-term P.L. 480 agreement in order to maintain some
                    degree of U.S. influence in Cairo. Johnson was reluctant, but <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> won his approval of a limited package of
                    P.L. 480 aid and credit sales for the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. (233,
                    241, 245, 248, 250, 256) The signature of a 6-month P.L. 480 agreement in
                    January 1966 and a February visit to Washington by President of the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> Assembly Anwar al-Sadat brought a brief warming
                    of relations. Both Johnson and <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> had
                    cordial conversations with Sadat. Johnson urged that the two countries try to
                    settle their differences in private rather than broadcasting them. (272, 275)
                        <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> did not take this advice,
                    however.</p>
                <p>In June 1966, <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> recommended against
                    signing a new P.L. 480 agreement. Administration officials were reluctant to
                    make this recommendation, Johnson's Special Assistant Walt
                        <persName>Rostow</persName> told him, but they felt <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> had “almost dared us publicly not to
                    renew our agreement.” (300) During the following months, the administration
                    extended $70 million in credit for food sales but continued to tell <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> officials that no decision had been reached on
                    a P.L. 480 agreement. <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Mustafa Kamel</persName> urged an agreement in meetings
                    with Johnson and <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>, assuring them that
                        <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> wanted good relations and
                    arguing with increasing urgency that an agreement was essential to prevent the
                    growth of Soviet influence in the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> asked why the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> needed Soviet arms and why it needed to keep an army in Yemen.
                    (301, 306, 307, 314, 377, 399)</p>
                <p>Although U.S. policymakers continued to hope for improved relations, <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> officials seemed increasingly persuaded that
                    the United States wanted a confrontation. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> told a visitor in late 1966 that he had become convinced
                    the U.S. Government was trying to overthrow and possibly assassinate him. (340)
                    He told Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BLD2">Lucius Battle</persName>
                    emotionally in March 1967 that the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> would not
                    respond to U.S. pressure; it did not want American wheat. (391) Meanwhile,
                    Johnson's advisers were raising the possibility of a new P.L. 480 agreement.
                    “It's hard to argue that we should burn all our bridges with the capital of the
                    Arab world,” <persName>Rostow</persName> told the President. (388) Johnson did
                    not approve the proposal. When the Middle East crisis erupted in May 1967,
                    administration officials were considering a proposal for a $24 million credit to
                    the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> but hesitating because of concern about
                    Congressional reaction. (412)</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Rising Tensions; More Arms for Jordan and Israel</p>
                <p>U.S. policymakers became concerned in mid-1965 with the rising number of
                    terrorist incidents and skirmishes on Israel's borders. The terrorism was not
                    the work of the Palestine Liberation Organization (<gloss target="#t_PLO1">PLO</gloss>), created in 1964, but of independent Palestinian terrorist
                    groups, chiefly Fatah. The latter was supported by Syria, although many
                    incidents occurred on Israel's borders with Lebanon and Jordan. (253, 355) U.S.
                    officials, concerned that border skirmishes might lead to wider fighting,
                    opposed Israeli reprisals and counseled the Israelis to take the incidents to
                    the United Nations. (218, 236, 246, 284, 317, 328) On one such occasion, Israeli
                    Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Golda Meir</persName> complained to
                    Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Barbour</persName> about a U.S. public
                    statement deploring the use of force by both sides. <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Barbour</persName> told her that Israeli reprisals made such statements
                    inevitable by removing Israel's status as injured party. <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName> told him tartly that she was not interested
                    in being an injured party; she did not want to be injured at all. (249)</p>
                <p>In November 1966 a large-scale Israeli raid into Jordan in retaliation for
                    terrorist incidents angered U.S. policymakers, who knew the Israelis were aware
                    of Jordanian efforts to prevent terrorism on the border with Israel. (221, 285,
                    327, 329) The United States voted for a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                    Security Council resolution censuring Israel, and President Johnson authorized a
                    message to the Israelis warning that another such raid would lead to a
                    suspension of U.S. military shipments. (333, 335, 342, 348) The raid profoundly
                    shocked the Jordanians and fueled unrest that threatened Jordan's stability.
                    President Johnson assured <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">King Hussein</persName> of
                    U.S. support, and U.S. officials sought to develop a positive response to
                    Jordan's request for new U.S. military aid to quell unrest in the armed forces.
                    (345, 346, 351, 354, 356) The United States and Jordan reached agreement on a
                    military aid package in December 1966. (369, 371–373)</p>
                <p>When the Israelis were informed of the pending decision on arms for Jordan, they
                    complained that it would unsettle the arms balance in the area. New York banker
                    Abraham Feinberg, who was sometimes an unofficial channel of communication
                    between Johnson and Israeli leaders, warned that the American Jewish community,
                    already upset by the U.S. vote to censure Israel, would be still more upset if
                    the administration gave arms to Jordan and not Israel. (358–359) Johnson told
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Arthur Goldberg</persName>, U.S. Representative
                    at the United Nations, to tell the Israelis that he could not make a deal but
                    that at the proper time, “we won't be chintzy with them.” (367) In January the
                    Israelis requested 200 armored personnel carriers (<gloss target="#t_APC1">APC</gloss>s) and other military equipment. The request engendered 4 months
                    of debate within the administration. The main issue, <persName>Rostow</persName>
                    told Johnson, was “how closely we should identify ourselves with Israel in view
                    of its unclear nuclear intentions and our interests in the Arab world.” (417)
                    Johnson approved most of the Israeli request. (381, 385–387, 394, 405–407, 410,
                    414) In mid-May 1967, as tension built on Israel's border with Syria, the
                    administration again counseled Israeli restraint. (419)</p>

                    the preparation of the Foreign Relations series. The staff of the Office of the
                    Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, plans, researches, compiles, and edits the
                    volumes in the series. This documentary editing proceeds in full accord with the
                    generally accepted standards of historical scholarship. Official regulations
                    codifying specific standards for the selection and editing of documents for the
                    series were first promulgated by Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_SFK1">Frank B. Kellogg</persName> on March 26, 1925. These regulations, with
                    minor modifications, guided the series through 1991.</p>
                <p>A new statutory charter for the preparation of the series was established by
                    Public Law 102–138, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1992
                    and 1993, which was signed by President <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">George
                        Bush</persName> on October 28, 1991. Section 198 of P.L. 102–138 added a new
                    Title IV to the Department of State's Basic Authorities Act of 1956 (22 USC
                    4351, et seq.).</p>
                <p>The statute requires that the Foreign Relations series be a thorough, accurate,
                    and reliable record of major United States foreign policy decisions and
                    significant United States diplomatic activity. The volumes of the series should
                    include all records needed to provide comprehensive documentation of major
                    foreign policy decisions and actions of the United States Government. The
                    statute also confirms the editing principles established by Secretary Kellogg:
                    the Foreign Relations series is guided by the principles of historical
                    objectivity and accuracy; records should not be altered or deletions made
                    without indicating in the published text that a deletion has been made; the
                    published record should omit no facts that were of major importance in reaching
                    a decision; and nothing should be omitted for the purposes of concealing a
                    defect in policy. The statute also requires that the Foreign Relations series be
                    published not more than 30 years after the events recorded. The editor is
                    convinced that this volume, which was compiled in 1994–1996, meets all
                    regulatory, statutory, and scholarly standards of selection and editing.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Structure and Scope of the Foreign Relations Series</p>
                <p>This volume is part of a subseries of volumes of the Foreign Relations series
                    that documents the most important issues in the foreign policy of the 5 years
                    (1964–1968) of the administration of <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B.
                        Johnson</persName>. The subseries presents in 34 volumes a documentary
                    record of major foreign policy decisions and actions of President Johnson's
                    administration. This volume documents U.S. policy toward the Arab-Israeli
                    dispute from January 1964 to May 1967.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Principles of Document Selection for the Foreign
                    Relations Series</p>
                <p>In preparing each volume of the Foreign Relations series, the editors are guided
                    by some general principles for the selection of documents. Each editor, in
                    consultation with the General Editor and other senior editors, determines the
                    particular issues and topics to be documented either in detail, in brief, or in
                    summary.</p>
                <p>The following general selection criteria are used in preparing volumes in the
                    Foreign Relations series. Individual compiler-editors vary these criteria in
                    accordance with the particular issues and the available documentation. The
                    editors also apply these selection criteria in accordance with their own
                    interpretation of the generally accepted standards of scholarship. In selecting
                    documentation for publication, the editors gave priority to unpublished
                    classified records, rather than previously published records (which are
                    accounted for in appropriate bibliographical notes).</p>
                <p>Selection Criteria (in general order of priority):</p>
                <p>1. Major foreign affairs commitments made on behalf of the United States to other
                    governments, including those that define or identify the principal foreign
                    affairs interests of the United States;</p>
                <p>2. Major foreign affairs issues, commitments, negotiations, and activities,
                    whether or not major decisions were made, and including dissenting or
                    alternative opinions to the process ultimately adopted;</p>
                <p>3. The decisions, discussions, actions, and considerations of the President, as
                    the official constitutionally responsible for the direction of foreign
                    policy;</p>
                <p>4. The discussions and actions of the National Security Council, the Cabinet, and
                    special Presidential policy groups, including the policy options brought before
                    these bodies or their individual members;</p>
                <p>5. The policy options adopted by or considered by the Secretary of State and the
                    most important actions taken to implement Presidential decisions or
                    policies;</p>
                <p>6. Diplomatic negotiations and conferences, official correspondence, and other
                    exchanges between U.S. representatives and those of other governments that
                    demonstrate the main lines of policy implementation on major issues;</p>
                <p>7. Important elements of information that attended Presidential decisions and
                    policy recommendations of the Secretary of State;</p>
                <p>8. Major foreign affairs decisions, negotiations, and commitments undertaken on
                    behalf of the United States by government officials and <pb n="V" xml:id="pg_V" facs="0005"/>representatives in other agencies in the foreign affairs
                    community or other branches of government made without the involvement (or even
                    knowledge) of the White House or the Department of State;</p>
                <p>9. The main policy lines of intelligence activities if they constituted major
                    aspects of U.S. foreign policy toward a nation or region or if they provided key
                    information in the formulation of major U.S. policies, including relevant
                    National Intelligence Estimates and Special National Intelligence Estimates as
                    may be declassified;</p>
                <p>10. The role of the Congress in the preparation and execution of particular
                    foreign policies or foreign affairs actions;</p>
                <p>11. Economic aspects of foreign policy;</p>
                <p>12. The main policy lines of U.S. military and economic assistance as well as
                    other types of assistance;</p>
                <p>13. The political-military recommendations, decisions, and activities of the
                    military establishment and major regional military commands as they bear upon
                    the formulation or execution of major U.S. foreign policies;</p>
                <p>14. Diplomatic appointments that reflect major policies or affect policy
                    changes.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Sources for the Foreign Relations Series</p>
                <p>The Foreign Relations statute requires that the published record in the Foreign
                    Relations series include all records needed to provide comprehensive
                    documentation on major U.S. foreign policy decisions and significant U.S.
                    diplomatic activity. It further requires that government agencies, departments,
                    and other entities of the U.S. Government engaged in foreign policy formulation,
                    execution, or support cooperate with the Department of State Historian by
                    providing full and complete access to records pertinent to foreign policy
                    decisions and actions and by providing copies of selected records. Many of the
                    sources consulted in the preparation of this volume have been declassified and
                    are available for review at the National Archives and Records Administration.
                    The declassification review and opening for public review of all Department of
                    State records no later than 30 years after the events is mandated by the Foreign
                    Relations statute. The Department of State and other record sources used in the
                    volume are described in detail in the section on Sources below.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Focus of Research and Principles of Selection for Foreign
                    Relations, 1964–1968, Volume XVIII</p>
                <p>The editor of the volume sought to present documentation illuminating
                    responsibility for major foreign policy decisions in the U.S. Government, with
                    emphasis on the President and his advisers. The documents include memoranda and
                    records of discussions that set forth policy issues and options and show
                    decisions or actions taken. <pb n="VI" xml:id="pg_VI" facs="0006"/>The emphasis
                    is on the development of U.S. policy and on major aspects and repercussions of
                    its execution rather than on the details of policy execution.</p>
                <p>President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon Johnson</persName> and Secretary of
                    State <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> were directly involved in the
                    many discussions relating to the Arab-Israeli dispute, and the editor tried to
                    document their roles in the policy deliberations and decisions as much as
                    possible. Their meetings and correspondence with Arab and Israeli leaders, as
                    well as their responses to pressures from both sides to provide sophisticated
                    weaponry and their appointments of special emissaries to visit the troubled
                    region, for example, are included in the documentary record.</p>
                <p>Major topics covered in the volume include: 1) U.S. efforts to continue the
                    preceding Kennedy administration's policy of trying to foster more friendly
                    relations with Gamal Abdel Nasser of the United Arab Republic (<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>) while maintaining good relations with Israel;
                    2) mounting tensions in the area, fueled by terrorist attacks on Israel and the
                    flow of Soviet arms to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, which undercut
                    this approach and led to the U.S. decision to provide increasingly sophisticated
                    armaments to Israel and Jordan; 3) the deteriorating U.S. relations with the
                        <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> as a result of the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>'s intervention in Yemen and <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s criticisms of U.S. policies, which
                    annoyed President Johnson and stirred Congressional opposition to economic
                    assistance; and 4) the continuing U.S. efforts, despite these irritants, to
                    pursue an even-handed approach to the Arab-Israeli dispute, prevent an arms race
                    in advanced weapons in the area, and seek to defuse the increasingly frequent
                    incidents on Israel's borders from flaring into full-scale war. The volume
                    concludes on the brink of the crisis that preceded the Six Day War; the crisis
                    and resulting war are documented in volume XIX.</p>
                <p>The editor included a selection of intelligence estimates and analyses seen by
                    high-level policymakers, especially those that were made available to President
                    Johnson.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Editorial Methodology</p>
                <p>The documents are presented chronologically according to Washington time or, in
                    the case of conferences, in the order of individual meetings. Memoranda of
                    conversation are placed according to the time and date of the conversation,
                    rather than the date the memorandum was drafted.</p>
                <p>Editorial treatment of the documents published in the Foreign Relations series
                    follows Office style guidelines, supplemented by guidance from the General
                    Editor and the chief technical editor. The source text is reproduced as exactly
                    as possible, including marginalia or other notations, which are described in the
                    footnotes. Texts are transcribed and printed according to accepted conventions
                    for the publication of <pb n="VII" xml:id="pg_VII" facs="0007"/>historical
                    documents in the limitations of modern typography. A heading has been supplied
                    by the editors for each document included in the volume. Spelling,
                    capitalization, and punctuation are retained as found in the source text, except
                    that obvious typographical errors are silently corrected. Other mistakes and
                    omissions in the source text are corrected by bracketed insertions: a correction
                    is set in italic type; an addition in roman type. Words or phrases underlined in
                    the source text are printed in italics. Abbreviations and contractions are
                    preserved as found in the source text, and a list of abbreviations is included
                    in the front matter of each volume.</p>
                <p>Bracketed insertions are also used to indicate omitted text that deals with an
                    unrelated subject (in roman type) or that remains classified after
                    declassification review (in italic type). The amount of material not
                    declassified has been noted by indicating the number of lines or pages of source
                    text that were omitted. Entire documents withheld for declassification purposes
                    have been accounted for and are listed by headings, source notes, and number of
                    pages not declassified in their chronological place. The amount of material
                    omitted from this volume because it was unrelated to the subject of the volume,
                    however, has not been delineated. All brackets that appear in the source text
                    are so identified by footnotes.</p>
                <p>The first footnote to each document indicates the document's source, original
                    classification, distribution, and drafting information. This note also provides
                    the background of important documents and policies and indicates whether the
                    President or his major policy advisers read the document. Every effort has been
                    made to determine if a document has been previously published, and, if so, this
                    information has been included in the source footnote.</p>
                <p>Editorial notes and additional annotation summarize pertinent material not
                    printed in the volume, indicate the location of additional documentary sources,
                    provide references to important related documents printed in other volumes,
                    describe key events, and provide summaries of and citations to public statements
                    that supplement and elucidate the printed documents. Information derived from
                    memoirs and other first-hand accounts has been used when appropriate to
                    supplement or explicate the official record.</p>

                <p>The Information Response Branch of the Office of IRM Programs and Services,
                    Bureau of Administration, Department of State, conducted the declassification
                    review of the documents published in this volume. The review was conducted in
                    accordance with the standards set forth in Executive Order 12958 on Classified
                    National Security Information and applicable laws.</p>
                <p>Under Executive Order 12958, specific information may be exempt from automatic
                    declassification after 25 years if its release could be expected to:</p>
                <p>1) reveal the identity of a confidential human source, or reveal information
                    about the application of an intelligence source or method, or reveal the
                    identity of a human intelligence source when the unauthorized disclosure of that
                    source would clearly and demonstrably damage the national security interests of
                    the United States;</p>
                <p>2) reveal information that would assist in the development or use of weapons of

                <p>4) reveal information that would impair the application of state of the art

                <p>5) reveal actual U.S. military war plans that remain in effect;</p>
                <p>6) reveal information that would seriously and demonstrably impair relations
                    between the United States and a foreign government, or seriously and
                    demonstrably undermine ongoing diplomatic activities of the United States;</p>
                <p>7) reveal information that would clearly and demonstrably impair the current
                    ability of U.S. Government officials to protect the President, Vice President,
                    and other officials for whom protection services, in the interest of national
                    security, are authorized;</p>

                    national security emergency preparedness plans; or</p>
                <p>9) violate a statute, treaty, or international agreement.</p>
                <p>The principle guiding declassification review is to release all information,
                    subject only to the current requirements of national security as embodied in law
                    and regulation. Declassification decisions entailed concurrence of the

                    completed in 1999, resulted in the decision to withhold about .3 percent of the
                    documentation proposed for publication; 2 documents were withheld in full. The
                    Office of the Historian is confident, on the basis of the research conducted in
                    preparing this volume and as a result of the declassification review process
                    described above, that the documentation and editorial notes presented here
                    provide an accurate account of U.S. policy in the Arab-Israeli dispute from
                    January 1964 to mid-May 1967.</p>

                <p>The editors of the Foreign Relations series have complete access to all the
                    retired records and papers of the Department of State: the central files of the
                    Department; the special decentralized files (“lot files”) of the Department at
                    the bureau, office, and division levels; the files of the Department's Executive
                    Secretariat, which contain the records of international conferences and
                    high-level official visits, correspondence with foreign leaders by the President
                    and Secretary of State, and memoranda of conversations between the President and
                    Secretary of State and foreign officials; and the files of overseas diplomatic
                    posts. All the Department's indexed central files for these years have been
                    permanently transferred to the National Archives and Records Administration
                    (Archives II) at College Park, Maryland. Many of the Department's decentralized
                    office (or lot) files covering this period, which the National Archives deems
                    worthy of permanent retention, have been transferred or are in the process of
                    being transferred from the Department's custody to Archives II.</p>
                <p>The editors of the Foreign Relations series also have full access to the papers
                    of President Johnson and other White House foreign policy records. Presidential
                    papers maintained and preserved at the Presidential libraries include some of
                    the most significant foreign affairs-related documentation from the Department
                    of State and other Federal agencies including the National Security Council, the
                    Central Intelligence Agency, the Department of Defense, and the Joint Chiefs of
                    Staff.</p>
                <p>In preparing this volume, the editor made extensive use of Presidential papers
                    and other White House records at the <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B.
                        Johnson</persName> Library. The bulk of the foreign policy records at the
                    Johnson Library are in the country files and other component parts of the
                    National Security File. The editor also consulted the Papers of <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">George Ball</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Robert Komer</persName>, two officials who were deeply involved in
                    policymaking for the region in the first half of the Johnson administration.</p>
                <p>Thanks to the leadership of the Johnson Library, the Department of State
                    historians had full access to the audiotapes of President Johnson's telephone
                    conversations. These audiotapes include substantial numbers of telephone
                    conversations between President Johnson and Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>, Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, the President's Special Assistant
                    for National Security Affairs <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">McGeorge
                        Bundy</persName>, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Arthur
                        Goldberg</persName>, and key members of Congress. The editor of this volume
                    selected for publication seven audiotapes of President Johnson's telephone
                    conversations dealing with Arab-Israeli issues. The editor prepared transcripts
                    of parts of these conversations, which were incorporated into footnotes or
                    editorial notes. Although the transcripts give the substance of the
                    conversations, readers are urged to consult the recordings for a full
                    appreciation of those dimensions that <pb n="XVI" xml:id="pg_XVI" facs="0016"/>cannot be captured fully in a transcription, such as the speakers' inflections
                    and emphases that may convey nuances of meaning.</p>
                <p>Second in importance only to the White House records at the Johnson Library were
                    the records of the Department of State. Because the Ambassadors in the countries
                    of the region played a major role in the formulation of policy, the volume
                    includes a large selection of telegraphic correspondence between the Embassies
                    and the Department of State. The Department's central files contain the cable
                    traffic recording U.S. diplomatic relations with Israel, the United Arab
                    Republic, Jordan, and other Arab countries; memoranda of diplomatic
                    conversations; and memoranda proposing action or providing information. Some
                    important documents are found only in the Department's lot files. The Conference
                    Files maintained by the Executive Secretariat contain briefing materials as well
                    as records of conversations. Documentation on initiatives that were not approved
                    is often found only in desk or bureau files. The <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> Papers include summaries of telephone conversations and
                    other useful documentation. Files of the Office of Near Eastern Affairs include
                    a selection of correspondence that provides insights into policy-making.</p>
                <p>Department of State historians also have access to records of the Department of
                    Defense, particularly the records of the Secretaries of Defense and their major
                    assistants and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p>
                <p>The Central Intelligence Agency provides the Department of State historians
                    access to intelligence documents from records in its custody and at the
                    Presidential libraries. This access is arranged and facilitated by the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>'s History Staff, part of the Center for the
                    Study of Intelligence, pursuant to a May 1992 memorandum of understanding.</p>
                <p>This volume includes a number of intelligence records. Among the intelligence
                    records reviewed for the volume were those in country and intelligence files at
                    the Johnson Library, the files of the Directors of Central Intelligence,
                    especially <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">John McCone</persName>, <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> intelligence reports and summaries, retired
                    files of the Department of State's Bureau of Intelligence and Research
                    containing National Intelligence Estimates, and the <gloss target="#t_INR1">INR</gloss> Historical Files.</p>
                <p>Almost all of this documentation has been made available for use in the Foreign
                    Relations series thanks to the consent of the agencies mentioned, the assistance
                    of their staffs, and especially the cooperation and support of the National
                    Archives and Records Administration.</p>
                <p>The following list identifies the particular files and collections used in the
                    preparation of this volume. The declassification and transfer to the National
                    Archives of the Department of State records is in process, and many of those
                    records are already available for public review at the National Archives. The
                    declassification review of other records is going forward in accordance with the
                    provisions of Executive Order <pb n="XVII" xml:id="pg_XVII" facs="0017"/>12958,
                    under which all records over 25 years old, except file series exemptions
                    requested by agencies and approved by the President, should be reviewed for
                    declassification by 2000.</p>

                    <p>Dear Mr. Prime Minister:</p>
                    <p>The visit to Israel of my good friend, Sargent Shriver, Director of the Peace
                        Corps, provides an occasion for me to renew the frank and friendly exchange
                        between our two governments.<note n="2" xml:id="d1fn2"> Shriver delivered
                            the President's letter to Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> on January 7. Their conversation is summarized in
                            telegram 751 from Tel Aviv, January 8. (Ibid.) A January 29 memorandum

                            File, Israel)</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>I am of course familiar with the correspondence between President Kennedy and
                        yourself as well as former Prime Minister Ben-Gurion. I too value greatly
                        the close and candid relationship that exists between our two governments.
                        This must continue, so I look forward to establishing the same high degree
                        of mutual understanding as existed during the administrations of our
                        predecessors.</p>
                    <p>Among the major problems which we will have to consider in the near future is
                        that of the Jordan waters, on which we stand behind you in your right of
                        withdrawal in accordance with the Unified Plan.<note n="3" xml:id="d1fn3">The Unified Plan, or Johnston Plan, developed in 1953–1955 negotiations
                            with the riparian states of the Jordan River Basin conducted by
                            Presidential emissary Eric Johnston, had never received formal
                            acceptance. For information about the Plan and U.S. policy concerning
                            it, see <ref target="frus1961-63v17#d8">

                        future security, in ways which will stabilize rather than upset the
                        situation in the area. We are much concerned, too, with finding a
                        satisfactory way to settle the refugee problem, as a prerequisite to
                        Arab-Israeli peace. You may be sure that we are giving these questions our
                        earnest attention and hope to exchange views fully and frankly with your
                        government on the best means of handling them. I hope to write you again
                        soon in response to your letter of November 4<note n="4" xml:id="d1fn4">For

                    <p>Your Majesty:</p>
                    <p>I am taking the occasion of the visit of my good friend and colleague Sargent
                        Shriver to the Holy Land to have him convey to Your Majesty my sincere
                        greetings and warm good wishes.</p>
                    <p>Although I have never visited Jordan, I feel I know your country both because
                        of my deep interest in the Bible and because of the very close and cordial
                        relations this country has with Jordan. Our support of Jordan's progress
                        under Your Majesty's wise leadership has been shown in many ways. We have
                        followed with pride the advances in Jordan's economic and political welfare.
                        The United States <pb n="3" xml:id="pg_3" facs="0035"/>is pleased to be
                        associated with Your Majesty's efforts to build your country and serve your
                        people.</p>
                    <p>I know the heavy burdens and serious obstacles faced by Your Majesty in
                        leading Jordan forward. Only a few years ago it took great faith to believe
                        Jordan could overcome the obstacles in its advance towards economic
                        self-sufficiency. Your Majesty supplied that faith through your leadership.
                        Your enduring confidence has now demonstrated that economic independence in
                        the foreseeable future is no idle dream. Let me assure you most sincerely
                        and categorically that the United States will continue to assist as it is
                        able Jordan's efforts toward achieving the goals you have so wisely

                    <p>The Ambassador said that on his recent consultation in Israel he had found
                        the government preoccupied with the key issue of defense. <pb n="4" xml:id="pg_4" facs="0036"/>Israel regarded the talks on November 12 and

                        subsequently had given further information especially on the tank situation.
                        He believed that the United States now had a good picture of Israeli
                        needs.</p>
                    <p>In Jerusalem, the Ambassador said, the Prime Minister had asked him to put to
                        the Secretary for consideration of the U.S. Government the entire security
                        situation in Israel, and especially the position concerning tanks, which was
                        very serious indeed. He appreciated the opportunity to do that now. There
                        were two aspects, qualitative and quantitative. Qualitatively, there was no
                        question that Israel was now completely out-classed by the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. Israel had Centurions, AMX's and Shermans.
                        By contrast, the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> had obtained Soviet
                        T–54's, Stalin 3's, and also had a declining number of T–34's. The T–54's,
                        which were coming in larger numbers, out-classed anything in the Israeli
                        tank inventory in all respects; fire power, armor, maneuverability, etc.
                        Thus, it was vital for Israel to replace at least three hundred of its tanks
                        with more effective tanks. It sought to obtain from the United States two
                        hundred M–48–A–3's within a year or so; and within two or three years one
                        hundred M–60's. These would all be replacements of old tanks.</p>
                    <p>Israel also faced a quantitative problem, the Ambassador said. In the
                        November talks the Israeli representatives had expressed the view, with
                        which they understood the Americans agreed, that minimum safety lies in
                        Israel maintaining a ratio of one to two, or at worst one to three, tanks
                        facing the Arabs. To maintain such ratio in the next two or three years
                        Israel would need to add two hundred more M–60's.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked where Israel had obtained its Shermans. The Ambassador
                        responded that they had been bought mostly in Europe, and that Israel had
                        obtained them because they were all that were available.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador stated that Israel believed its policy of deterrence had
                        worked in the past fifteen years. Now Israel was faced with problems of
                        maintaining the deterrent. It regarded these problems as finite. With the
                        aid he was discussing Israel thought it could preserve its position for the
                        next five years or so making it quite clear to the Arabs that attacks on
                        Israel would not pay.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador said that while the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> was
                        the main threat to Israel, his country had to keep certain tank strength to
                        face the Jordanian armed forces, whom Israel rated highly. It also kept a
                        small number of tanks against the Syrians and Iraqis, because Israel was
                        very vulnerable <pb n="5" xml:id="pg_5" facs="0037"/>in the middle of the
                        country, at places not more than ten miles wide and good tank country.</p>
                    <pb n="6" xml:id="pg_6" facs="0038"/>
                    <p>The Secretary, stating that he was not implying anything by his question,
                        asked whether Israel had looked into the race between tanks and anti-tank
                        missiles. He had the impression that over time the tank was likely to be on
                        the way out, like horse cavalry. As an old infantryman, he would be happier
                        handling a modern anti-tank weapon than being inside a tank. The Ambassador
                        said this question had come up briefly at the November talks, and that
                        General <persName corresp="#p_RY1">Rabin</persName> had made the Israeli
                        view clear. Israel was thinking of its immediate tank problem as a very
                        short range issue during a period of extreme vulnerability. The one thing to
                        do in the next few years was to meet tanks with tanks.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador continued that Israel hoped to get these tanks from the United
                        States as military assistance. Its military burden had become very heavy.
                        The Prime Minister was an old hand at defense problems, having been
                        Secretary General of the Finance Ministry and Minister of Finance, and now
                        being Minister of Defense as well as Prime Minister. Thus he was very alert
                        to the financial aspects of the military burden, and had shown himself very
                        sensitive to it, so he was not inflating the need.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that military assistance funds were very stringent at the
                        moment. Some of the recent cuts had been more damaging to our military
                        assistance program than to the economic assistance program. We would, of
                        course, study the request. The Secretary asked whether we have had from
                        Israel information about its military expenses outside of any aid question.
                        The Ambassador replied that Israel had not been asked to provide this. The
                        Secretary pondered that it might be useful.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador said he wanted to speak a word about the naval side. The
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> had developed a capability of
                        blockading, bombarding and landing, against which Israeli defenses were
                        absolutely out-classed. Now Israel faced the problem of ship-to-shore
                        missiles as well. This was another aspect in Israel's enormous defense
                        burden. In the budget for the coming year, starting April 1, the Israel
                        defense establishment would get one billion Israeli pounds, 40 percent of
                        the regular budget, and 11 percent of the <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that we were very sympathetic to the problem of defense,
                        and would take a look at Israeli requests. Military assistance was a
                        considerable problem for us, he noted, with reduced availabilities and very
                        important needs. He said he thought it would be helpful if the Government of
                        Israel would let us have information on defense expenses abroad, since this
                        information could be highly relevant and was of the sort always expected of
                        military aid recipients.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked if the Israeli Government had made its request in
                        writing. The Ambassador said not except in the letter that Prime Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> had addressed to President

                                Document 391</ref>.</note> I stressed that 1964 was likely to prove
                        a real test of our improving relationship. This was primarily because of the
                        Jordan waters, one of those Arab-Israeli issues on which the US and <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> necessarily disagreed. We were impressed by
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s handling of this problem
                        so far (I cited Port Said speech<note n="4" xml:id="d4fn4">A memorandum by
                                <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Robert W. Komer</persName> of the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Staff commenting on the speech is

                        commentary), and we emphatically hoped that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> as the No. 1 Arab leader could sustain a policy of
                        restraint. I gently reminded Habib how circumstances over the last
                        year—particularly Yemen—had led to the Gruening Amendment,<note n="5" xml:id="d4fn5">Reference is to an amendment to the Foreign Assistance
                            Act of 1963, signed December 16, 1963 (P.L. 88–205; 77 Stat. 387),
                            barring U.S. foreign aid, including assistance under P.L. 480, to any
                            country that the President determined was engaging in or preparing for
                            aggressive military action against the United States or any country
                            receiving U.S. assistance. The amendment's sponsors made it clear that
                            it was aimed at the United Arab Republic.</note>
                        <pb n="7" xml:id="pg_7" facs="0039"/>which seriously limited our freedom of
                        maneuver. I feared that an outpouring of Arab hostility over the Jordan
                        waters would lead to great Congressional pressure on the Administration.
                        This (despite our own recognition that the Arabs intended no military
                        action) might just force our hand. If we could only get through 1964 without
                        a real setback in US relations with the Arabs, I felt sure that the obvious
                        uptrend of the last few years would be continued and strengthened.</p>
                    <p>Habib seemed most receptive, but asked what kind of an “out” we could provide
                        for the Arabs. I replied that we had attempted to devise just such an out
                        with the unified plan of 1955, calling for an equitable division of the
                        Jordan waters among various users. We were insistent that Israel stick to
                        this allocation, which left 60% of the waters for the Arabs. Habib asked
                        what our attitude would be toward an Arab call for international observation
                        and checking, both of water withdrawals and of nuclear developments. I
                        parried that our response would obviously depend on the nature of the
                        proposals but in principle I felt we would favor any such international
                        arrangement that seemed acceptable to the parties.</p>
                    <p>As Habib left he mentioned Abu Simbel and the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>'s hope that President Johnson would send some personal
                        message when the US contribution was made. I told him only half
                            jocularly<note n="6" xml:id="d4fn6">The words “only half jocularly” were

                        we could suitably memorialize US help for Abu Simbel.</p>

                    <p rend="center">SUMMARY OF AMBASSADOR <persName corresp="#p_BJS1">BADEAU</persName>'S LETTER OF JANUARY 3, 1964 TO THE PRESIDENT</p>
                    <p>1. Egypt is the paramount Eastern Arab state and the leader of the
                        nationalist reform movement. Although the drive for Arab unity has slowed,
                        Nasser remains the most widely respected Arab leader. This gives the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> a significant independent capacity to
                        affect American interests in the area.</p>
                    <p>2. Our interests are: to blunt Soviet penetration; to preserve Western access
                        to sea and air routes and to Arab oil; and to promote peace and progress in
                        the area.</p>
                    <p>3. Our policy has featured: extension of economic assistance; evenhandedness
                        in area disputes; and readiness to commit our power and prestige to the
                        defense of our interests.</p>
                    <p>4. The wisdom of these policies has been shown by an increase in American
                        influence at the expense of Soviet influence since 1956. In addition,
                        inter-Arab quarrels have been moderated; the public <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> position on Jordan waters has been moderate, as has their
                        position on recent U.S. support for Israel; the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> has kept the Israel question in the icebox, and is now
                        considered to be likely to attack Israel only if it believes Israel has
                        begun to produce nuclear weapons. Private U.S. claims are slowly being
                        adjudicated; Western access to the Suez Canal seems assured (barring
                        Arab-Israel hostilities); and the Egyptians have shown an increasing
                        appreciation of the advantage of closer cooperation with the West.</p>
                    <p>5. The remaining problems between Cairo and Washington are manageable.
                        Egyptian withdrawal from Yemen has been slow, but they recognize the
                        disengagement principle. There is no present threat to the Saudi Government
                        or to Aden, and there might be chaos in Yemen if the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> moved out too fast.</p>
                    <pb n="9" xml:id="pg_9" facs="0041"/>
                    <p>6. The <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> remains heavily dependent on
                        Soviet military aid, but Western aid—especially PL 480—has helped preserve
                        nonalignment; the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> is still hostile to
                        Israel, but leans toward containment. Time may heal even this wound.</p>
                    <p>7. In conclusion, cessation of U.S. aid to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> would not moderate their policies, would nullify the gains
                        since 1956 and jeopardize our interests. The guillotine can only be used
                        once per subject.</p>

                            reviewed the Yemen problem and pointed out that Congressional amendments
                            aimed at the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> were “storm signals” as
                            to the state of U.S. public opinion and its possible impact on U.S.
                            economic assistance to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>.
                            (National Archives and Records Administration, <gloss target="#t_RG1">RG</gloss> 59, Central Files 1964–66, POL 1 <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>-US)</note> I discussed Jordan waters problem along
                        lines reftel.</p>
                    <p>Earlier in conversation President stated Summit Conference had been under
                        consideration since last mid-summer. So long as Baath regimes controlled
                        both Syria and Iraq, <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> considered summit
                        meeting impossible and therefore had waited until Baath collapse in Baghdad
                        had isolated and weakened Baath in Syria, putting it in a position where it
                        could not refuse to attend conference. This factor determined date of
                        issuance call for summit.</p>
                    <p>Re Jordan waters, I briefly presented US attitude based upon reftel, stating
                        I had requested political counselor Bergus to meet with Presidential advisor
                        Hassan Al Kholi on January 7 for full exposition of US <pb n="10" xml:id="pg_10" facs="0042"/>position. US position put forward not in
                        intent to influence summit deliberations but as factual statement of our
                        well-known diagnosis of problem and attitude thereon.</p>
                    <p>In making presentation I particularly stressed riparian rights, pointing out
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> as downstream user of Nile waters
                        originating beyond its borders should be particularly sensitive to correct
                        riparian position. President at once responded by saying withdrawal of Nile
                        waters based upon agreement between countries concerned and no such
                        agreement had been made between Arab states and Israel.</p>
                    <p>While admitting this diplomatically true, I pointed out Johnston Plan had
                        evoked a technical “meeting of minds” by all parties concerned and on this
                        basis <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> believed progress in utilizing
                        potential of Jordan waters for benefit of all parties could be made.
                        President did not argue point but passed on to ask what my “personal”
                        opinion was—“not as Ambassador but as long-time student of Middle Eastern
                        affairs.” I responded neither I personally nor my Government were in any
                        position to put forward “our solution,” but it seemed to me any objective
                        student of situation would identify following points:</p>
                    <p>(A) Use of force—either overt or covert—would not solve Jordan water problem
                        and therefore this solution must be put aside as neither in interests of
                        Arabs nor of international community whose concern for tranquillity in
                        Middle East was active and legitimate.</p>
                    <p>(B) Plans to divert headwaters of Jordan, as speculated upon in Cairo press,
                        equally unrealistic and dangerous. Whatever legal rights or wrongs of such a
                        move, any riparian state whose chief water supply is thus cut off would have
                        no recourse but to fight. If in course of an Ethiopian-<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> dispute, Ethiopia diverted Blue Nile, Egypt
                        would certainly move to stop this. I opined Israel would do same and would
                        win large measure of sympathy and support in international community.</p>
                    <p>(C) Question appeared to be not whether Israel would or would not use more
                        Jordan water, but if it would do this within context of Johnston Plan which
                        had been technically recognized as possible and beneficial to all users.
                        Therefore most protective and constructive action Arabs could take would be
                        to develop their own use of water, both as benefit to themselves and as
                        inhibition of Israelis using more water than allotted to them by Johnston
                        scheme.</p>

                        members.</p>
                    <p>President's only response was to ask, “Do you mean if we were to divert
                        headwaters of Jordan, we would be subject to Israeli aggression?” I objected
                        to use of word “aggression,” saying water was such vital interest any state
                        would move to protect it, and this could scarcely be called “aggression.”
                        President then said, “This means we must remain <pb n="11" xml:id="pg_11" facs="0043"/>strong and prepared.” With this he dropped topic, being
                        obviously unwilling to discuss any details of summit meeting.</p>

                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> explained briefly
                        that he was calling, as he had on several others, to explain the basis for
                        Israel's increased security requirements, especially for tanks. As Prime
                        Minister <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> had said in his 4
                        November 1963 letter, Israel's needs fell into three categories: (1)
                        surface-to-surface missiles to meet the growing <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> missile threat; (2) tanks to modernize Israeli armor; (3)
                        some means of countering growing <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> naval
                        strength. The Prime Minister had also stressed the great economic burden
                        that Israel was carrying, which it had to take into account in seeking to
                        meet its security needs. Of course Israel's immediate and primary need was
                        for tanks.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> commented that we could see how the growing
                        imbalance between Israeli and Arab armor posed a “real” problem, and were
                        actively looking into it. But why did Israel need missiles? We genuinely had
                        trouble in following their reasoning here. To us, for Israel to spend a lot
                        of money on missiles seemed wasteful and unnecessary. <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName>
                        <pb n="12" xml:id="pg_12" facs="0044"/>responded that Israel had hoped
                        escalation of the arms race in the Middle East could have been avoided, but
                        the US itself had found that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
                        was uninterested in arms controls. The Israelis had presented to us their
                        evidence about growing <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> missile
                        stockpiles. These created a real psychological and military problem for
                        Israel. In the absence of any effective arms controls, the Israeli
                        Government felt it had to go ahead and develop a deterrent to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s missiles.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Bundy</persName> said that he literally could not follow the
                        Ambassador's argument. He could see a psychological problem, but in
                        practical military terms <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s
                        missiles were useless. So what would Israel get from matching them with an
                        equally wasteful investment? It reminded him of the arguments of those
                        people in the US who thought we ought to build blast shelters and
                        anti-missile missiles just because the Soviets might have them rather than
                        because we saw an actual need for them. Tanks, he granted again, were a
                        “real issue.” We could talk about this, but when we got down to brass tacks
                        there was a genuine question as to why we should give tanks as grant aid to
                        Israel when it was, as we had heard, planning to buy surface-to-surface
                        missiles from France. We simply didn't see <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s missiles as posing the kind of threat that would
                        require a major Israeli investment in anyone's missiles in return. Our
                        intelligence people had looked at the problem again after the US-Israeli
                        intelligence talks. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName>
                        confirmed that we couldn't believe the Israeli estimate that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> would build a 900–1000 missile force
                        by 1969 or that even a force of this size with conventional warheads could
                        interrupt Israeli mobilization. He and Col. Ron had a brief exchange about
                        the differences in our estimates.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> then put the case of
                        Israeli missiles on political grounds, saying that we must appreciate the
                        Israeli situation—Israel, surrounded by the Arabs, hemmed in on every side,
                        harassed by constant Arab hostility, had to show its own people that it was
                        able to deter any level of Arab military attack. Mr.
                            <persName>Bundy</persName> again expressed skepticism as to whether a
                        substantial Israeli investment in <gloss target="#t_SSM1">SSM</gloss>s was
                        the answer. He noted that Israel did not seem to have told us very much
                        about its missile plans. How far along were they? <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> replied that their plans had not yet jelled, as
                        General <persName corresp="#p_RY1">Rabin</persName> had indicated when
                            here.<note n="2" xml:id="d7fn2">

                    <p>
                        <persName>Bundy</persName> thought it would be helpful if the Israelis would
                        tell us about their plans. It would create a tough problem for the US to
                        find that others were selling Israel missiles while we were giving tanks.
                        Moreover, while not deprecating the seriousness with which Israel <pb n="13" xml:id="pg_13" facs="0045"/>must look at every aspect of the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> military build-up, we tended to credit the
                        Israelis with greater qualitative superiority over the Arabs than the
                        Israelis did themselves. <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName>
                        objected to what he called the general tendency in the US Government to
                        “overexaggerate” Israel's superior technology and manpower. He pointed out
                        that 55% of the children entering primary school this year were of
                        non-European descent. Israel was having a hard time absorbing so many
                        immigrants. The quality of its armed forces vis-a-vis the Arabs wasn't as
                        high as many Americans seemed to think. He then returned to the problem of
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> missiles, saying that one of the
                        difficulties was that these missiles might make the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> cocky enough to try a fight with Israel, simply because the
                        Egyptians wouldn't realize how limited a capability they actually had.
                        Possession of a missile force might encourage the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> to be more aggressive than purely military calculations
                        would justify.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Bundy</persName>'s rejoinder was that we had no desire to look
                        down our noses at the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> missile force, but
                        the simple fact was that such missiles without nuclear warheads would not be
                        meaningful. However, if Israel went in for a substantial missile force along
                        with its existing nuclear potential, it would create the real possibility of
                        a whole new dimension in the Middle East arms race. If any Middle East
                        country acquired a nuclear delivery capability, then we would have such a
                        major change in the situation as to confront us with a grave policy problem.
                        We would be forced to re-evaluate the whole basis of our Middle East
                        policy.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName>, who seemed a little
                        harassed at this point, switched the subject by asking “how about tanks?”
                            <persName>Bundy</persName> again said that this was a real question
                        which we could look at in real terms, though grant aid would be difficult
                        because <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> was so thin. We could see
                        Israel's need for tanks, but there were legitimate questions as to the
                        numbers and types that Israel needed, and as to when and how these could be
                        made available, either by us or by other friends. He was no expert on tanks
                        so couldn't discuss these, but his brother in the Defense Department was
                        looking into them and could give some more authoritative reactions.
                            <persName>Bundy</persName> was sure that we would have arguments over
                        such questions as the number and type, but at least these were real
                        questions with which we could come to grips.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> explained the Israeli “two-bite
                        request.” First of all, they wanted to replace some 300 of their Shermans
                        with modern tanks—200 M48A3s and 100 M60s. The second bite would be to meet
                        the continuing Soviet build-up of Arab armor. Here they hoped for some 200
                        M60s over the next 2–3 years. On the money, they hoped to get the tanks
                        free. <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> explained the great
                        security burden Israel was carrying. Defense now took 40% of the Israeli
                        regular budget and 11% of <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss>. <pb n="14" xml:id="pg_14" facs="0046"/>The Israeli economy was really stretched.
                        Israel had to lay out vast sums for the absorption of immigrants, and it was
                        hard to see how it could buy tanks at full value.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Bundy</persName> explained the tightness of our <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> program, given the recent Congressional
                        cuts. These had fallen particularly heavily on <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>, so on this question we would have to be tough. We would
                        expect to apply to the Israelis the same cost-effectiveness standards that
                        we applied to our own military establishment. But at least these were
                        questions we could lay on the table and discuss. At the same time, in the
                        common interest, we ought to take another look at the missile problem. We
                        should have a similarly real discussion of what the Israelis had in mind and
                        whether it made sense. If Israel was asking us for grant aid, we had an
                        interest in knowing how they were spending their own money. He emphasized
                        that if we thought for a minute there was a real <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> missile threat, we wouldn't talk this way. We were not
                        saying that Israel couldn't or shouldn't buy a few missiles (5 or so) for
                        psychological deterrent purposes if it felt it mandatory, but our impression
                        was that Israel was going much further. These things were “silly” with
                        conventional warheads. Yet, for just this reason if Israel bought missiles
                        it would mean to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> that Israel
                        was going nuclear. This was the risk we saw—and it wasn't just Israel's
                        risk, it was our risk too. It was a matter of deep common interest to the US
                        as well as to Israel to keep all of our commitments to Israeli security.
                        This had been President Kennedy's view, and it was equally that of President
                        Johnson.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Bundy</persName> then pointed out that 1964 was going to be a very
                        sticky year anyway, because of the pro-Israeli stand we were going to take
                        on the Jordan Waters. If on top of this we seemed to be subsidizing directly
                        or indirectly a build-up of Israel military strength in so dangerous a field
                        as missiles, especially against essentially frivolous <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> weapons, it would be hard for us to
                        maintain our present position in the Middle East.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> fervently hoped that
                        we would not get into a missile discussion with Israel. He expressed his
                        strong conviction that Israel was under the gun, recounting how when he
                        returned to Israel twice in 1963 he had explained to all concerned that the
                        US commitment to support Israel was firm. However, he'd had a rough time at
                        home. He had found a general feeling that Israel could not depend solely on
                        unofficial US guarantees, but had to have its own deterrent power. The
                        Israeli Government and Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> faced a difficult problem in convincing the Israeli
                        people that Israel could cope with the missiles which Nasser was obviously
                        building and which he kept flaunting publicly.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador, after pausing, commented that he greatly appreciated Mr.
                            <persName>Bundy</persName>'s candor and would be frank in return. When
                        we raised certain economic questions about Israel's request for tanks, this
                            <pb n="15" xml:id="pg_15" facs="0047"/>was reasonable; we could talk
                        about costs and whether Israel could afford purchase rather than grants. But
                        he feared that if we entered into long negotiations about US availabilities
                        and numbers and types, we would complicate matters. Quite frankly, there
                        were many in Israel who said Israel should not spend desperately needed
                        money on older model, reconditioned tanks which would soon be obsolete. It
                        would be wiser to wait a while and buy a new model, which would give Israel
                        a deterrent advantage for several years. <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> feared that if we were sticky, this school of thought
                        would again come to the fore. Both <persName>Bundy</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName> responded that there might be
                        something to the argument about waiting for something better. In any case,
                            <persName>Bundy</persName> assured him we were fully prepared to lay our
                        cards on the table and discuss this as well as other matters. However,
                        Israel must recognize that there were legitimate questions as to what was
                        needed for our own forces, what we could spare, what our new production
                        plans were, etc.</p>
                    <p>In closing, <persName>Bundy</persName> emphasized how we regarded both the
                        missile and tank problems as matters of common interest, which we should
                        explore jointly and freely with a full exchange of information on both
                        sides. He also hoped that nothing he had said would indicate that we did not
                        regard Israeli concerns as serious. However, among close friends there ought
                        to be the kind of full and frank airing of respective viewpoints that would
                        lead to those joint decisions which would best serve us both.</p>

                    <p>I had lunch with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> and
                        he used the occasion to renew the plea for surface-to-surface missiles,
                        tanks and naval weapons.</p>
                    <p>He referred to the fact that he had discussed this with Mr.
                            <persName>Bundy</persName> and that he had been disturbed by the
                        reaction he had received. He said that Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> kept
                        directing the conversation to the missile <pb n="16" xml:id="pg_16" facs="0048"/>question and strongly urged that Israel deny itself
                        surface-to-surface missiles. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> said that if this was the position of the United
                        States Government the conversations would probably be unproductive, for
                        Israel must reserve the right to decide what weapons it needs to protect
                        itself.</p>
                    <p>I said that we were not attempting to structure Israeli defense forces, but
                        the question presented to us fell into three categories:</p>
                    <p>1. What type of weapons should we make available to Israel? Our analysis
                        indicated that neither missiles nor naval weapons were necessary, but we
                        were actively considering a request for tanks.</p>
                    <p>2. Assuming we agreed to make tanks available, what kind of tank could be
                        provided? Here there was some question as to whether or not we could export
                        M–60s and whether or not anti-tank weapons would not also be useful. This
                        determination was largely a Defense Department matter.</p>
                    <p>3. Assuming Israel accepted the tanks, we had the problem of payment terms.
                        It was in this connection that Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> made the valid
                        comment that before we modified the terms on which military equipment was
                        normally sold we had a right to know whether Israel could afford to pay
                        regular prices at regular terms. The only way to make this determination was
                        to examine the purposes for which the defense budget was being used. If
                        Israel was expending money for useless equipment, we had a right to demand
                        that such expenditures be curtailed and the funds diverted to tanks before
                        offering special assistance in the purchase of tanks. Similarly, if Israel
                        was using its defense budget in a manner that would heighten the arms race
                        or increase the prospect of war, we had a right to request that these funds
                        be diverted to the purchase of tanks before modifying the normal purchase
                        terms for military equipment.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> found this difficult
                        to understand. He pointed out that Egypt already had surface-to-surface
                        missiles, and we had agreed that they would have at least 500 of these
                        within 4 years (Israeli intelligence said they would have 900 to 1,000).
                        Israel would be at a serious disadvantage, he said, if they could not have
                        at least 100 missiles.</p>
                    <p>I asked specifically whether Israel had an agreement to purchase missiles
                        from France. He said he did not know.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> concluded the
                        discussion by urging that we send Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> a prompt response. He said this was promised in the
                        letter from the President delivered by Mr. Shriver and was eagerly awaited.
                        Time was extremely important to him and to his Government. I said he would
                        have to understand that the subject was complex and that it took some time
                        to develop the United States position, but I assured him we were proceeding
                        as expeditiously as possible.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>We face a difficult and challenging year in the Near East. The Soviets are
                        actively seeking to recoup their recent setbacks. Turmoil in the Arab States
                        has sharpened tensions among themselves and vis-a-vis Israel. Israel is
                        increasingly anxious about its future security. What is more, our own
                        interests are steadily more caught up in the area, because of Europe's
                        growing dependence on reasonable access to Middle East oil, our needs for
                        strategic transit and communications, the importance of blocking Soviet
                        advances, and our other stakes in peace in the region.</p>
                    <p>I foresee a series of issues in the coming months that could severely strain
                        our position and our influence in the area. The most important of these
                        are:</p>
                    <p>— Arab reactions to Israeli diversion of Jordan waters (the toughest of
                        all);</p>
                    <p>— Israeli nuclear potential implied by completion of the Dimona reactor;</p>
                    <p>— the future of Palestine refugees and of <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss>;</p>
                    <p>— threats of increased and sophisticated armaments;</p>
                    <p>— conflicts between Arab governments and Western oil companies.</p>
                    <p>We have learned over the years that the key to a constructive Near Eastern
                        policy is maintaining a balance in our relationships with the Arabs and
                        Israel. This has never been easy. In our interest, but also in Israel's, we
                        have been at pains during the past three years to build fruitful ties with
                        the Arabs. In 1964, as never before, we will need our Arab relationships to
                        weather the storms likely to be aroused by the issues I have listed.</p>
                    <p>I believe we shall need to make a heavy investment of U.S. prestige in 1964
                        in support of Israel against Arab resentments on several of these issues.
                        Actions we propose to take, with your approval, to limit adverse effects of
                        the Jordan waters diversion, Dimona, refugees, and the arms race are
                        discussed in Enclosure 1.</p>

                    <p>As to Israel's estimates of its military defense needs, which preoccupy its
                        leaders and shape their current view of U.S.-Israel relations, we face
                        decisions on what the U.S. should do and when. Israel has asked us to
                        furnish it five hundred tanks under the Military Assistance Program. Prime
                        Minister <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> also wrote to
                        President Kennedy that Israel needs assistance in obtaining naval equipment
                        and missiles. In fact, Israel seeks ever closer military and political
                        identification with us. We are looking at ways to help it meet its most
                        critical problems. However, we see its needs in a broader context. In the
                        past, consistent with our policy of refusing to become a major supplier of
                        offensive weapons to states likely to be involved in an Arab-Israel war, we
                        have encouraged Israel to fill its requirements for such weapons in Europe.
                        It has done so. Israel has both public and private assurances of our
                        commitment to its integrity and security. In mid-1963, a <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> review of our military capability to
                        respond to possible aggression against Israel<note n="2" xml:id="d9fn2">Text

                        that we could deploy to meet any potential threat within 30 hours. He so
                        informed Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>. What
                        is more, the Arabs have shown they are well aware of both our intentions and
                        our capabilities to deter and stop aggression. In our view, this reduces the
                        need for Israel to press far and fast toward weapons escalation that would
                        almost certainly throw the Arabs closer into the arms of the Soviets.</p>
                    <p>While Israel's increased vulnerability in the field of armor will not become
                        critical for the next year or two, or perhaps longer, there may be an
                        earlier psychological requirement to assure Israel that its armor needs will
                        be met in time. Otherwise, we are likely to be subjected to a strong Israeli
                        pressure campaign and renewed demands for a security guarantee. On the other
                        hand, we may want to time any arms deal with Israel so as to avoid
                        additional Arab antagonism just when we are taking a pro-Israeli stand on
                        the Jordan Waters.</p>
                    <p>It is also essential to use the steps we take to aid Israel as leverage to
                        achieve greater Israeli cooperation in matters of importance to us. For
                        example, we are greatly concerned lest in response to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>'s so-called missiles, which we see as of no
                        military significance, Israel acquire much better missiles in quantity from
                        France. Aside from the drain on Israeli funds (which could otherwise be used
                        to buy tanks), this would enhance Arab fears of a nuclear arms race and
                        might create dangerous repercussions. So we may want to use our help on
                        Israel's tank problem to get Israel to forego (or sharply limit) any missile
                        buildup.</p>

                    <p rend="center">DETAILS OF ARAB-ISRAEL PROBLEMS—1964</p>
                    <p>Five major problems involve potential violence or threaten basic United
                        States interests in the Near East in 1964. Fortunately, we begin 1964 with
                        considerable prestige and good will built up during recent years. These
                        assets give us positive leverage, which we shall need to maintain through
                        and after 1964 if we hope to see an ultimate Arab-Israel accommodation and
                        protection of our major interests in the Near East.</p>
                    <p>Our policy problems in the Near East are almost always a matter of balance.
                        To deal successfully with the issues ahead, we shall continue to need
                        influence with both Arabs and Israelis. In practice the question of
                        exclusive identification with any Arab state, or with the Arabs generally,
                        does not arise. Israel, however, seeks a close military identification with
                        us to serve as a deterrent to the Arabs. Such a relationship would not only
                        destroy the influence we need to maintain with the Arabs but stimulate
                        closer Arab-Soviet ties and reduce our ability to bring about an eventual
                        peaceful solution to the Arab-Israel dispute.</p>
                    <p>In the mid-1950s the Arabs thought we had identified ourselves completely and
                        finally with Israel. The Soviets saw an opportunity to side with the Arabs
                        and wreck the Free World position in the Near East. They largely succeeded
                        so far as the French and British were concerned. It has taken several years
                        to reverse Soviet successes, damp down the Cold War in the Near East, and
                        regain the flexibility we need. A policy of balance permits us to protect
                        our own interests in access to oil on reasonable terms, strategic transit
                        and communications rights and facilities, as well as to help Israel achieve
                        long-term security. Our ability to maintain meaningful relations with the
                        Arab states is essential to attain these objectives.</p>
                    <p>Against this background, the five predictable problems of 1964 come into
                        focus:</p>
                    <pb n="20" xml:id="pg_20" facs="0052"/>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic"> Jordan Waters</hi>: Israel will begin to divert water out
                        of the Jordan basin, from Lake Tiberias, this spring. Test pumping is
                        scheduled for about mid-February. Sustained pumping will begin two or three
                        months later. For a decade this has been foreseen as the issue most likely
                        to cause a new Arab-Israel war. Despite their determination to prevent
                        diversion, the Arabs cannot successfully take on Israel. But there is always
                        some danger they will talk themselves into disaster.</p>
                    <p>In a major gesture of support, President Kennedy committed us to stand beside
                        Israel, provided its water withdrawals are held within the limits of Eric
                        Johnston's comprehensive 1955 Plan.</p>
                    <p>We have made extensive diplomatic preparation to fulfill this commitment. Our
                        objective is to prevent Arab use of force or any Arab interference with
                        Israel's plans, but in such a way as not to exhaust the leverage we need
                        with the Arabs in other divisive issues.</p>
                    <p>Our best bet is reliance on:</p>
                    <p>a) A strengthened United Nations peacekeeping machinery in the area,</p>
                    <p>b) Vigorous behind-the-scenes diplomacy with the Arabs, and</p>
                    <p>c) Recourse to the United Nations Security Council or General Assembly as
                        necessary.</p>
                    <p>If we get over this hump without war, we will have made a contribution to
                        Israel almost as basic as our support for its creation in 1948.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Dimona Reactor</hi>: Israel's French-built 25 megawatt
                        power reactor will be completed in January or February. Israel has assured
                        us it will be limited to peaceful uses but with it Israel will have a small
                        nuclear weapons potential. We anticipate strong Arab reactions and, at the
                        least, renewed talk of acquiring comparable installations, perhaps with
                        Soviet help.</p>
                    <p>Fortunately, we have persuaded the Israelis to invite us to inspect Dimona
                        periodically. We can use our findings to limit the fears of the Arab
                        governments. We need to continue pressing the Israelis firmly to keep off
                        the nuclear weapons path. But these steps will not be enough in the long
                        run. Israel is thinking of a 125–150 megawatt power reactor, five times the
                        size of Dimona. The <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> will try to keep
                        abreast.</p>
                    <p>We cannot prevent the two sides from moving ahead so long as both stick to
                        peaceful uses. Therefore, safety will lie in:</p>
                    <p>a) Involving responsible Free World states in reactor development on both
                        sides so we can know what is going on and have maximum control through
                        bilateral safeguards arrangements,</p>
                    <p>b) Encouraging acceptance of <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> controls
                        to replace bilateral ones,</p>
                    <p>c) Exploring possibilities for an Arab-Israel nuclear free zone or acceptance
                        of such other international restraints as may be evolved, and</p>
                    <p>d) Reassuring each side on the basis of our knowledge of the capability and
                        intentions of the other side in the nuclear field.</p>

                    <p>Israel has presented a sizeable request for military assistance. On the list
                        in 1963 were a public security guarantee, secret contingency planning, naval
                        equipment, surface-to-surface missiles, grant-aid United States tanks (300
                        now, 200 later), etc. Our November exchanges with the Israelis indicated
                        that these requests are out of line with Israel's actual military needs.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Israel needs</hi> gradual modernization of its tank and
                        anti-tank defenses. In other respects it has a healthy margin of superiority
                        for some years to come. The <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>'s showcase
                        missiles are in fact only that, not a military threat, and will probably
                        remain so unless Israel gets into serious missilery and the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> then turns to the Soviets for help. The
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> missiles point up, however, the
                        domestic psychological problem Israel's leaders face.</p>
                    <p>The Israelis and others have made efforts to downgrade our capability and
                        commitment to defend Israel. Without going so far toward Israel that we
                        break the bond of confidence we have developed with the Arabs and risk
                        creating a vastly dangerous <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>/Arab
                        versus United States/Israel lineup, we can lay more effective emphasis on
                        what we have very generously done and are doing to help. And there are
                        certain new moves we can make in 1964 that will please Israel and help meet
                        its domestic political problem (and ours). Details of both are in the second
                        enclosure.</p>
                    <p>In addition, however, we need to work at measures to curb the arms race and
                        enhance stability. To that end:</p>
                    <p>a) We should continue active exploration of arms limitation and control.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> has spoken to Foreign
                        Minister Gromyko about the possibility of mutual restraint in the
                        disposition of obsolete weapons. <pb n="22" xml:id="pg_22" facs="0054"/>Our
                        Ambassador in Cairo has begun to probe his Soviet colleague on aspects of
                        arms control in the area. We have talked to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> secretly about the United States becoming a kind of
                        guarantor for working arrangements to control the escalation of arms. There
                        is discussion of arms control, as well as nuclear free zone possibilities,
                        in the United Nations context. From all of these not much has opened up so
                        far, but the time might come when we could do something serious with the
                        Russians about restraint. Our capability to deal with all parties in this
                        field is enhanced by our traditional Near East arms policy.</p>
                    <p>b) We should make clear on appropriate public occasions that we will defend
                        the independence of all Near East states and will resist aggression in any
                        form.</p>
                    <p>c) If we facilitate solution of Israel's tank problem, we should get
                        assurance in return that Israel will not plunge the Near East into either
                        the sophisticated missile or the nuclear weapons field.</p>

                        based on existing United Nations resolutions has further compounded the
                        problem. If we fail, we could probably buy time by continuing to support

                        Arabs read this as our goal. We have already tightened <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss>'s belt. The climax will come next fall

                        asked:</p>
                    <p>a. Are the numbers and types of tanks requested necessary and appropriate to
                        Israeli needs?</p>
                    <p>b. If the United States does approve the Israeli request in principle, is the
                        equipment requested the most useful equipment to offer?</p>
                    <p>c. Is it advisable to substitute anti-tank weapons (other than tanks) or
                        other vehicles for a part of the total requirement in order to reduce
                        costs?</p>

                            <gloss target="#t_JCSM1">JCSM</gloss>–953–63 commented on two undated
                            draft memoranda to the President on the subject “Near East Arms Policy.”
                            The first, prepared in the Department of State, recommended adhering to
                            the traditional U.S. policy of restraint regarding arms sales to Near
                            Eastern states. The second, prepared in the Department of Defense,
                            recommended modifying the traditional policy by permitting sale of
                            defensive armaments, abandoning the practice of deferring to European
                            sources of arms for Israel or the Arab states, and permitting the sale
                            of offensive weapons on a case-by-case basis if consistent with the
                            objective of maintaining a sufficient equilibrium between the Arab
                            states and Israel and among the Arab states to minimize the danger of
                            hostilities. The text of <gloss target="#t_JCSM1">JCSM</gloss>–953–63 is

                        Staff forwarded their views on proposed changes to the “Near East Arms
                        Policy,” including the assessment that “the substantial military equilibrium
                        presently existing among Near Eastern states does not warrant immediate
                        action to supply major quantities of arms to any of these countries. Rather,
                        the highest priority effort should be directed toward achieving agreement
                        among Middle East arms suppliers to restrict the flow of arms into the area.
                        Pending the results of such efforts, however, the arms policy should provide
                        the requisite flexibility without positively identifying the United States
                        with either side in the Arab-Israeli conflict.” Appendix A hereto provides
                        an assessment of the Arab-Israeli arms balance.<note n="4" xml:id="d10fn4">The appendices are attached but not printed.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>3. It is understood that a final decision to reaffirm or modify the “Near
                        East Arms Policy” has not yet been made. In considering the questions posed
                        in the referenced memorandum, the Joint Chiefs of Staff have therefore
                        assumed that:</p>
                    <p>a. US objectives in respect to the Near East include the maintenance of
                        military equilibrium between Israel and its immediate Arab neighbors, and
                        the avoidance of actions likely to intensify the Arab-Israeli arms
                        competition.</p>
                    <p>b. Provision of tanks to Israel must be consistent with the US policy on
                        supplying arms to Near Eastern countries.</p>
                    <p>c. US military equipment would be made available to Israel only through the
                        medium of sales.</p>
                    <p>d. To minimize the diversion of Israeli foreign exchange resources from
                        essential economic development programs, the most economical solution to
                        Israel's tank modernization problem is desirable.</p>
                    <pb n="25" xml:id="pg_25" facs="0057"/>
                    <p>4. With these assumptions in mind, the Joint Chiefs of Staff believe that the
                        following criteria should be applied in responding to Israel's request for
                        tanks:</p>
                    <p>a. Conformity with approved Israeli Army Force Guidelines, which are
                        predicated on Israel's orientation toward the West and her subjection to
                        international peace-keeping supervision, which requires restraint on
                        excessive arming.</p>
                    <p>b. Consistency with requirements for strengthening Free World security forces
                        and the protection of US political and economic interests.</p>
                    <p>c. Necessity for internal security and legitimate self-defense
                        requirements.</p>
                    <p>d. To the extent possible, avoidance of contribution to and acceleration of
                        regional arms competition.</p>
                    <p>e. Assistance in offsetting the foreign exchange costs of maintaining the US
                        military position abroad.</p>
                    <p>5. Applying these criteria to the Israeli tank request, the Joint Chiefs of
                        Staff note that the major Israeli Army combat units in being coincide with
                        the approved Force Guidelines. Furthermore, a significant increase in
                        Israeli Army units does not appear to be justified by the existing strength
                        relationship between the Israeli and Arab Armies. However, replacement of
                        obsolete armored equipment in the current Israeli inventory could be
                        justified on the basis that the Arabs possess modern heavily armed and
                        armored tanks. Because of the extremely sensitive political situation in the
                        Near East, any US participation in a program to sell modern tanks to Israel
                        would have to be managed discreetly. At a minimum this would entail phasing
                        in small quantities over a time span of 2–3 years and insuring that there is
                        no significant net increase in the number of weapons in Israeli hands. See
                        Appendix C for discussion of additional factors bearing on the problem.</p>
                    <p>no comparable US weapon in production. Recoilless rifles, M–72s and the like,
                        very probably would not meet the Israeli desires to enhance their tactical
                        offensive capabilities, implicit in the tank request. Armored personnel
                        carriers would be useful to Israel as a replacement for its US armored half
                        tracks, but would not be responsive to the Israeli request.</p>
                    <p>7. In view of the above and the factors discussed in Appendices B and C
                        hereto, the Joint Chiefs of Staff conclude that the sale of tanks to Israel
                        cannot be predicated primarily on military considerations and that:[dc0]</p>
                    <p>a. Replacement of 300 of Israel's present M–4 tanks is militarily sound on
                        the basis of modernization, and the types requested are appropriate to
                        Israeli needs. However, a net increase in Israel's tank inventory is not
                        presently justified.</p>
                    <p>b. The types of tanks requested are the most useful equipment that could be
                        offered Israel, but M–48 tanks would also meet Israeli needs.</p>
                    <p>c. The United States can provide no substitute anti-tank weapons which would
                        meet Israel's needs and also be substantially lower in cost than M–48
                        tanks.</p>
                    <pb n="26" xml:id="pg_26" facs="0058"/>
                    <p>8. Should a decision be made to sell US tanks to Israel, it is recommended
                        that:</p>
                    <p>a. Israel be offered 300 M–48 tanks for phased delivery during the next 2–3
                        years.</p>
                    <p>b. If Israel considers M–48s unacceptable, M–48A3s be offered only on the
                        basis of converting present stocks of M–48A series tanks to M–48A3s (with
                        the addition of 105MM gun, if Israel so desires). Such action would require
                        that tanks so converted be replaced in the US Army inventory with
                        M60A1s.</p>
                    <p>c. If it is decided to offer Israel M–60A1 tanks, this be done only on the
                        basis of expanding presently authorized production rates to provide the
                        quantity agreed upon.</p>

                    <p>In addition those points put to you by PriMin <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> January 15, Harman (1) sought agreement <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> would desist from specific reference to
                        Unified Plan allocations, particularly Yarmuk allocation for Adasiya, in
                        talks with other governments; (2) pressed us reaffirm specifically that
                            <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> supports (a) downstream disposition
                        of all saline waters that may be collected in and around Tiberias and (b)
                        principle that no waters be wasted; and (3) urged <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> not to press for final resolution of allocational
                        differences since technical formula as far as Israel could possibly go.</p>
                    <p>Both the January 23 and January 24 conversations tended become rather complex
                        reiterations of respective positions and concerns. So much so that at
                        conclusion January 24 meeting and to make absolutely clear where <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> stands in response PriMin <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> demarche, we handed Harman following
                        “piece of paper”:</p>
                    <p>“1. We would strongly oppose Arab aggression if there should be an effort to
                        frustrate Israel's plans.</p>
                    <p>“2. Cairo Conference made it unlikely Arabs will seek recourse to Security
                        Council. We can discourage such recourse but not deny it. We do not share
                        Israel's fears of United Nations involvement and its possible consequences.
                        If problem should get into Council one way or another:</p>
                    <p>“a. We would oppose renegotiation of Unified Plan;</p>
                    <p>“b. We would be against halting or otherwise interfering with completion and
                        operation of Israel's Tiberias pumping plan provided latter is kept within
                        Unified Plan;</p>
                    <pb n="28" xml:id="pg_28" facs="0060"/>
                    <p>“c. We would have to maintain flexibility as regards nature of verification
                        and supervision over riparians' Jordan water operations to ensure
                        consistency with Unified Plan. We would not approve unilateral verification
                        or supervision. In our understanding with Israel we have almost complete
                        agreement as to nature of supervision called for in Unified Plan. We prefer
                        leave matters at that for time being.</p>
                    <p>“d. We would anticipate continued closest consultation with Israel, but we
                        should not now try to spell out tactics.</p>
                    <p>“3. We hope hear final confirmation of Israel's assent to technical
                            formula.<note n="6" xml:id="d11fn6">Telegram 319 to Amman, January 30,
                            stated that the Israeli Embassy informed the Department on January 29
                            that the Israeli Government accepted the Wiener-Criddle technical
                            formula. (Ibid.)</note> This is matter of immediate practical importance
                        in terms of what we can recommend to Jordan.</p>
                    <p>“4. Even with technical formula agreed to, we would like to be on firmer
                        footing. So far, Israel has reserved its position and we have said what we
                        must support. We will not take initiative but will continue present our view
                        of specific allocations when questions of fact as to nature of Unified Plan
                        arise. If there should be public airing of precise Unified Plan allocations,
                        the difference between Israel's position and what we support would appear.
                        Arabs could drive a wedge between us. Therefore, we urge Israel's formal
                        acceptance of all Unified Plan allocations as United States is committed to
                        these in its understanding with Arabs.”</p>
                    <p>On <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName>'s other points, insofar as
                        these not answered by position paper, we said opposition to water wastage
                        and question of saline water disposal, like other elements technical
                        formula, are matters we can support with Jordanians with conviction they are
                        consonant with US-Arab understanding of Unified Plan. Entire formula is ad
                        referendum to Jordan. This is a highly sensitive matter for that country and
                        we are far from sure it will be able accept our recommendations.</p>
                    <p>You should convey foregoing position paper to PriMin <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> or other <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> official as our considered reply to <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>'s January 15 demarche. At your

                        statements remains as important in weeks ahead as it was during and before

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName> has requested the following
                        information.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> had indicated that
                        acquisition of a nuclear weapons capability by Israel would be cause for war
                        no matter how suicidal for the Arabs. It is vital for the preservation of
                        peace in the Near East, therefore, to reassure <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> as to the peaceful nature of the 24-megawatt reactor
                        Israel has just activated at Dimona.</p>
                    <p>President Kennedy explained this problem to Prime Minister Ben-Gurion in
                            1961<note n="2" xml:id="d12fn2">For a record of the conversation on May

                        periodic inspections of the reactor by the United States technicians to
                        establish its peaceful nature. Pursuant to this oral agreement, Israel did
                        not object to our passing information on the first two Dimona visits to
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>. During the last exchange

                        Ambassador he was reluctant to agree to our passing information on the

                        matter further consideration later. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> was the only exception; <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> did not take issue with our passing the information
                        to other nations.</p>
                    <p>A United States inspection team visited Dimona last January 18. Its findings
                        show the reactor was activated December 26, 1963, and has no immediate
                        weapons making capability. The team agreed periodic semi-annual visits to
                        the facility would be desirable to assure ourselves of its continuing
                        peaceful purpose. A summary of the team's preliminary report is
                        enclosed.</p>
                    <pb n="30" xml:id="pg_30" facs="0062"/>
                    <p>With the completion of the first inspection since activation, we should press
                        Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> to agree to our
                        discreetly passing our findings to President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>. We regard reassurance to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> about Israel's nuclear intentions and capabilities as
                        essential to offset the news of Dimona's having gone critical. This is
                        certain to reach <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> soon. Coming
                        at a time when Israel's building up of a sophisticated missile capability
                        that may also become public, we think passage of such reassurances as we can
                        give is the minimum to prevent some drastic United Arab Republic move to
                        acquire a new level of Soviet weaponry.</p>
                    <p>Past experience has shown that direct intervention by the President is the
                        most effective way to obtain Israel's cooperation on the Dimona problem. We
                        believe firm and persistent persuasion by the President will induce Prime
                        Minister <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>'s compliance. We
                        believe it desirable to continue treating the problem of reassuring
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> orally. This permits
                        greater flexibility and does not risk hardening either Israel's position or
                        ours.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p rend="center">SUMMARY OF FINDINGS OF DIMONA INSPECTION TEAM</p>
                    <p>The inspection team spent over eleven hours at the Dimona reactor site on
                        January 18 and inspected all significant facilities. It determined that</p>
                    <p>The reactor went critical on December 26, 1963, but has operated only at low
                        power. It was clearly designed as an experimental reactor, capable of
                        operation at 15 to 20 per cent above design power of 26 megawatts. Operation
                        at full power is not anticipated until late 1964.</p>
                    <p>The reactor center, valued at $60 million, is the most diversified and well
                        equipped nuclear installation in Africa or the Middle East. Present and
                        projected facilities will provide a capability within 1–1/2–2 <pb n="31" xml:id="pg_31" facs="0063"/>years to produce 50 to 60 tons of natural
                        uranium metal per year. This is 5 to 6 times the production rate required to
                        support the heavy water-moderated reactor, if operated according to stated
                        plans. Reasons given for this excessive capacity are 1) the desire to
                        conserve essentially the full uranium production potential from phosphate
                        operations, 2) the desire to be self sufficient, 3) the equipment installed
                        is the minimum size available commercially for a one-step production
                        process, and 4) the belief that uranium will increase in value.</p>
                    <p>The present fuel stockpile includes one full charge and about 10 tons in
                        process. Discussions are underway to obtain a second core from France. It is
                        hoped to produce the third core domestically. The fuel now on hand is
                        subject to material control and committed to be returned to France.</p>
                    <p>Upon completion of construction a year or so hence, the reactor plant may be
                        declassified.</p>
                    <p>The plant has no weapons making capability at present, but continuing
                        periodic inspections are recommended.<note n="7" xml:id="d12fn7">A talking

                            states that there “appears to be little doubt that the center is now
                            designed and intended for nuclear research” but that the reactor's
                            capacity and fuel supply and preparation facilities “would permit the
                            Israelis to redirect the program in the future toward achievement of a

                        tells us the President, while sympathetic, does not see the need to make a
                        final decision now. He wants to wait until the election is closer, in any
                        case, and feels if we give tanks to the Israelis now they will be back at us
                        before November for something else. Several other factors also lead Messrs.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">McGeorge Bundy</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName>, State, and ourselves all to feel we
                        had better make haste slowly here:</p>
                    <p>(1) We are greatly concerned over the likelihood that the Israelis are about
                        to invest some $45 million in a French Dassault missile (similar to the
                        Pershing). We see this as another step toward putting themselves in a
                        position to acquire an independent nuclear deterrent. If the Arabs get the
                        same idea, it could undermine our whole policy in the Middle East. It would
                        force the Arabs to get more arms from Moscow at the least.</p>
                    <p>(2) Considerable anti-U.S. sentiment has been stirred up in Arab States over
                        the Cyprus situation, the Jordan waters problem, and the “anti-Arab”
                        implications alleged to be contained in recent speeches by President Johnson

                            cooperative research in using nuclear energy for desalinization. For

                        all of which would make an accommodation move toward Israel impolitic at
                        this time.</p>
                    <p>(3) The general U.S. policy toward arms sales in the Middle East is now
                        undergoing intensive review, and State would not like to make <pb n="33" xml:id="pg_33" facs="0065"/>a final decision on the tank sale until this
                        has been considered by the President.</p>
                    <p>(4) Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">McGeorge Bundy</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> are of the opinion that any decision to sell tanks
                        should not be conveyed to the Israelis at least until Prime Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>'s visit here in June, which
                        would meet the President's point about optimum political timing.</p>
                    <p>(5) There is also the necessity to recognize that Israeli intelligence within
                        the U.S. is so good that they will probably learn of our decision almost as
                        soon as it is made and we will have no bargaining position with them once a
                        decision is reached.</p>
                    <p>(6) Your proposed approved sale is for 300 tanks, while Israel requested 500;
                        and some further discussion of the tank requirement at the military level is
                        desirable as underpinning for our ultimate position.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Alternative Approaches:</p>
                    <p>Because of the above considerations, State and the White House staff have
                        determined to delay decision on the tank sale for the present, and to
                        acquire as much additional information as possible on Israeli missile and
                        nuclear plans. The following alternative decisions appear to be the most
                        likely:</p>
                    <p>(1) The Israelis will abandon or delay indefinitely plans to acquire an
                            <gloss target="#t_SSM1">SSM</gloss> capability, in which case the tank
                        sale would probably be approved by the two governments at the time of
                            <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>'s visit.</p>
                    <p>(2) The Israelis will not commit themselves to abandonment of their missile
                        acquisition plans, but will agree to consult with us on such planning to
                        such a degree as to make the tank sale desirable as a quid pro quo. Whether
                        or not the sale would be made under these conditions would depend upon the
                        degree of Israeli cooperation and the degree of predicted Arab reaction at
                        the time of the announcement.</p>
                    <p>(3) The Israelis will refuse to abandon or delay missile acquisition. In this
                        case the sale of tanks will probably not be approved.</p>
                    <p>(4) A preferable solution involved in all of the above (which the Israelis
                        have informally proposed) is that the U.S. might avoid political
                        implications of the sale by arranging, or assisting in the financing of a
                        sale by or through the FRG or the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>. This
                        possibility is now being explored in the U.S. Government, but no mention has
                        been made at any level elsewhere. The Israelis have made some inquiries on
                        their own in FRG and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>. State in particular
                        strongly endorses this procedure.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Proposed Interim Step:</p>
                    <p>In connection with the problems of nuclear proliferation and the Middle East
                        arms policy, the <gloss target="#t_ISA1">ISA</gloss> Policy Planning Staff
                        has been accumulating <pb n="34" xml:id="pg_34" facs="0066"/>information and
                        preparing studies for some time on the nuclear and missile capabilities of
                        Israel and the Arab States. This information makes it plain that the
                        Israelis have progressed well along in initial arrangements with the French
                        on missile development and production; and that the Egyptian missile
                        development has no such degree of reliability as would justify the sort of
                        missile planning which the Israelis are pursuing. We are also extremely
                        concerned about the Israeli capacity to produce a nuclear warhead which
                        might be mated with the missile.</p>
                    <p>We see Mr. Rowen's trip as a means of carrying to the Israeli Government our
                        contentions that there is little military threat from the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>'s so-called missiles, certainly not enough
                        to justify Israel's wasting money on a counter-deterrent with all the risks
                        involved. We have little confidence that the Israeli Embassy here has fully
                        clued its home office on our objections to potential nuclear proliferation
                        by Israel, or the way in which Israeli missile acquisition might trigger
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> preemption or, at the least, push
                        the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> (and other Arabs) closer to Moscow
                        again. Second, we see a need to get a better fix on why Israel wants a nice
                        round number like 500 tanks, so as to buttress our case for offering only
                        300. So, the next appropriate step would appear to be to send a small party
                        of <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> personnel, who are knowledgeable in
                        the tank and missile fields, to continue the dialogue without publicity in
                        Tel Aviv. Because Henry Rowen will be in Rome for discussions on Monday and
                        Tuesday, and because of his special work in the missile and nuclear programs
                        in recent weeks, it was thought appropriate to have him continue to Tel Aviv
                        on Thursday and Friday, accompanied by an Army General Officer with
                        expertise in tanks and missilry, to continue dialogue, in hope of obtaining
                        further information and indications from the Israelis on these subjects. The
                        party specifically would not discuss details of the proposed tank sale or
                        indicate that any U.S. decision has been made, but would only further
                        discuss the tank requirement.</p>

                    <p>Please deliver following letter from President to Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>:</p>
                    <p>“Dear Mr. Prime Minister:</p>
                    <p>“I am delighted that you and I will soon have an opportunity to discuss our
                        mutual interests and problems. The dates of June 1 and 2 would suit me
                        well.</p>
                    <p>“I also want to thank you for the warm welcome given Sargent Shriver during
                        his recent visit to Israel. He has told me in glowing terms of the
                        hospitality he received. He was much impressed with the technical assistance
                        work your people have undertaken, and he particularly enjoyed his meeting
                        with you.</p>
                    <p>“As you know, we have been giving careful thought to your expressed concerns
                        about Israel's security needs. In particular we can understand your worries
                        over the growing imbalance between Israeli and Arab armor, and can see the
                        justification for your feeling that you <pb n="36" xml:id="pg_36" facs="0068"/>must take steps to modernize Israel's tank forces and
                        anti-tank defenses. We are fully prepared to discuss this problem further
                        with you.</p>
                    <p>“At the same time we are disturbed lest other steps which Israel may
                        contemplate taking may unnecessarily contribute to a heightened arms race in
                        the region without in fact contributing to your security. Among other
                        things, we seem to have quite different estimates with respect to the likely
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> missile threat, and the potential
                        costs and risks of various ways of meeting it. Because of our own link to
                        Israel's security, I feel that these matters too are of legitimate mutual
                        concern and merit frank discussion.</p>
                    <p>“As you and I are both so well aware, we face a number of issues this year
                        that will demand a heavy investment of United States effort in support of
                        Israel. Among them are the Jordan waters off-take, the activation of the
                        Dimona reactor, and the related problems of Israel's security and the Near
                        East arms race. We must work together to minimize undesirable repercussions
                        and devise steps to avoid unnecessary increases in Arab antagonism, with the
                        consequent weakening of the forces of moderation. At stake is United States
                        influence with the Arabs, which we see as an essential component of our
                        ability to help bring about any improvement in the relations between Israel
                        and its neighbors.</p>
                    <p>“I am sure we will want to discuss all these matters when we meet. Pending
                        our meeting, I hope that your people and mine can air them frankly and
                        freely so as to narrow down any points of difference. In the meantime let me
                        assure you again that your genuine security concerns remain very much in our
                        minds, and we of course wish to keep in closest touch about any significant
                        developments that might affect Israel's situation.</p>
                    <p>“Sincerely,</p>

                    <p>Saw King afternoon February 22 after his return from Aqaba. Drawing on Deptel
                        346 and thorough briefings by Criddle and <persName corresp="#p_SHM1">Symmes</persName> I sought first to reassure him that primary purpose
                        US proposals was to assist Jordan obtain its rightful share of waters in
                        quickest and least costly manner. Pointed out that due geography of area
                        Jordan, as downstream user, was vulnerable to any Israeli cut off of water
                        which might occur in retaliation for Arab actions whether taken by Jordan or
                        by others. (At this point, King nodded assent.) I went on to explain reasons
                        why US believes it essential retain Unified Plan as background control until
                        or unless replaced by other agreements and why we can consider financial
                        help only for measures that do not contravene plan. At same time, made clear
                        we understand that Jordanian, or Arab, actions must be portrayed by them as
                        part of “Arab plan” and as measures to take what rightfully belongs to
                        Arabs. I then briefly described once more our suggested power plant pool
                        pump and connecting pipe to East Ghor Canal which I had outlined in some
                        detail during previous talk (Embtel 390) and went over in more detail than
                        previously other projects in which <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                        disposed to be helpful (paragraph 5 Deptel 346). Emphasized that although
                        all are within Unified Plan they not being proposed as alternative to any
                        “Arab plan” which might emerge but could well be parts of that plan.
                        (Especially stressed this point because of indication that Jordanian
                        technicians, thanks to Criddle's persuasive powers, now taking favorable
                        view of US suggestions but feared political authorities would reject them as
                        being substitute we were trying to talk Arabs into adopting in place of
                        “Arab plan.”) In speaking of Maqarin Dam I said any <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> assistance would have to be clearly related to construction
                        of 300 MCM storage but this did not mean we would oppose the eventual
                        erection with non-USG funds of storage or power facilities in excess this
                        capacity. Reverting again to <pb n="39" xml:id="pg_39" facs="0071"/>risks
                        for Jordan involved in contravening terms of Unified Plan and consequent
                        loss our leverage on Israelis to require them to continue to conform, I said
                        US had succeeded in getting their firm agreement to a technical formula re
                        use of Tiberias and Yarmouk waters provided we could assure them Arabs would
                        tacitly abide by it. I then handed him copy of formula, pointing out that
                        adherence to it would ensure sweet water enough to fulfill needs Jordanian
                        farmers on lower Jordan via power plant pool and East Ghor Canal. Concluded
                        by expressing hope we could continue to keep in close and frank
                        consultation.</p>
                    <p>King read formula carefully but made no comment other than that he would
                        study it. Continued he thought we knew his general views which he had
                        expressed in previous conversation and would not now repeat. Would have to
                        press ahead with “Arab plan” but thought that its final provisions might not
                        be very different from those of Unified Plan. Then asked if we had discussed
                        our proposals with others. I said Criddle had fully explained them to Salim
                            <note n="4" xml:id="d16fn4">
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> chief water expert Dr. Mohammad

                        as I had just done. As we were walking to the door, King remarked he was
                        worried by report Hafiz had stated yesterday that Syria would feel obliged
                        to shell Israeli military installations when pumping from Tiberias
                        commenced. I said this worried me also. Since Arabs making great point of
                        being completely united on measures to combat Israeli pumping plans,
                        Israelis might feel the more justified in retaliations against any Arab
                        state—e.g. Jordan.</p>

                    <p>Part I. This is fifth in series. The US delegations followed consultations
                        with <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> delegation at G.H.Q. with audience
                        Prime Minister/Defense Minister <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>
                        in one-hour plus talks on Friday 21 Feb 64, approx 1245–1400. <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> very impressive in this session which
                        almost a monologue, but courteous, sincere and showing firm belief in this
                        convictions/statements.</p>
                    <p>Part II. Ambassador gave Prime Minister President Johnson's letter which
                        arrived that morning. Rowen made appropriate comments including: US viewing
                        Israel's need for armor favorably, but not yet decided. On missiles, US
                        finding difficulty accepting Israeli need, views subject as dangerous and
                        considers acquisition sophisticated missiles by Israelis would initiate
                        missile race in <gloss target="#t_ME1">ME</gloss>. Questioned Peres when
                        final decision to be made with answer of “one year possibly later.” Rowen
                        continued that Israeli acquisition would cause escalation. Problem: adequate
                        range missiles, effective only with nuclear warheads thus US interested in
                        Israeli nuclear plans/intentions. Egyptian threat exaggerated and with
                        improved armor <gloss target="#t_IDF1">IDF</gloss> does not need missiles.
                        Peres viewed Egyptian missiles could be effective, would cause panic and
                        Israelis required retaliatory missiles. Rowen showed concern that US
                        assistance re tanks would see Israeli use of tank money saved to purchase
                        missiles. Rowen added towards end of audience that when decision on missiles
                        is made, the US would like to be informed Israeli intentions in this
                        field.</p>

                    <p>Part III. Prime Minister's comments: Missiles are dangerous, expensive and
                        not sure decision possible in one year; probably 2 years more accurate. On
                        security basis, price is no object. Israel is home of Jewish nation, last
                        and only foothold requiring last-ditch stand even if must lower standard of
                        living to lowest African level. Israel has tried talking peace with
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, but even in last two
                        weeks <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> has stated no
                        alternative but crush Israel. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>/Arabs continually vocally insistent on destruction of
                        Israel. US helps Egypt with far bigger sums which helps <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> in arms build-up. What does <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> spending such large sums on missiles mean?
                        Israel's population—which from 60–70 nations, are here only 10–15 years—are
                        afraid of even bad missiles. And <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s missiles may become good missiles. Also may get
                        further missile help from Russia which makes concern even heavier. There is
                        no solution to concern over <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>.
                        On giving up missiles, if US provides tanks, Israel not prepared to give up
                        missiles. On controlling arms race in <gloss target="#t_ME1">ME</gloss>,
                        would welcome such possibility, but appears impossible. On Rowen's question
                        whether <gloss target="#t_IDF1">IDF</gloss> can live without missiles if
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> doesn't go ahead with missiles,
                            <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> said Israelis would be
                        happier and stop thinking about missiles.</p>
                    <p>Part IV. Parts I and II above based on Strickland notes confirmed by
                        Ambassador's recall.</p>
                    <p>Part V. Ambassador's recall/comments, follow: Peres indicated Israelis did
                        not have missile program currently and that decision to develop on own or
                        procure is one-year off or more. <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> confirmed and believed two years probably more
                        accurate. <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> suggested US instead
                        of approaching Israelis go to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
                        with arguments to stop production missiles or Israelis would get good
                        missiles from US; this would immediately stop race. To Rowen's insistence
                        that type of missile Israelis investigating only useful with nuclear
                        warheads, <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> looked aghast,
                        appeared to be new thought to him, and finally stated, “Don't try to
                        persuade us to put nuclear warheads on them.” To Rowen's question on Israeli
                        thinking re reactions to Arab threat, <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> pointed out formulae developed over years which
                        showed Israelis prepared to accept a time-delay in reacting, prepared to be
                        a little behind new Arab military developments. <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> sounds sincere, firm in convictions about political
                        origins of state and status of Israel, last-ditch stand for Jewish nation,
                        Jews all over world but only one Jewish nation, terrible expense for defense
                        justified, and expects to give President Johnson this but in more
                        detail.</p>
                    <p>Major point: When Rowen attempting tie-in acquisition armor to missile
                        problem, <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> strongly urged against
                        US consideration of two problems simultaneously and asked urgent closure of
                        gap through fulfillment Israeli armor requirements.</p>
                    <pb n="42" xml:id="pg_42" facs="0074"/>
                    <p>Major premise: Israel not interested in taking over 30 million Arabs and
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> not in right mind if he
                        believed such was Israeli objective. Israel would cut own throat by
                        conquering Egypt. (This is good argument for US approaches to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> to cease on missile developments.)
                        Additional <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> comments: In view of
                        absolute priority Israel security, even considering US assistance, primary
                        responsibility of Prime Minister is to tell and show his people Israel doing
                        all possible on independent basis to protect their existence. Now
                        understands US looking favorably on armor and that President Johnson plans
                        to discuss this, but <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> wonders
                        when discussion will stop and decision materialize. Ambassador's
                        clarification of arms-control possibilities made point that Israel should
                        clearly understand that US not interested in weakening Israeli security
                        posture, and that Israel should put more stock in US commitments. Suggested
                        that security could thus be assured equally adequately and not likely to
                        cause repercussions. <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> mentioned
                        Komars to Ambassador, but did not make pitch that they more effective than
                        Egyptian missiles; merely added them to Egyptian missile capabilities.</p>

                    <p>The potential for missile and nuclear weapons development in the Near East
                        led us last year to explore the possibilities for an unobtrusive arms
                        limitation agreement between Israel and the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. A special Presidential emissary, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">John J. McCloy</persName>, met with President
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> for this purpose in June

                        <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s response was not entirely
                        negative but it did not give us a peg for an approach to the Israelis. He
                        indicated he might associate <pb n="43" xml:id="pg_43" facs="0075"/>himself
                        with some form of “collective” renunciation of nuclear weapons and might
                        give us written public assurance not to acquire nuclear weapons or attack
                        Israel. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BJS1">Badeau</persName> in
                        September left with President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
                        a draft letter from President Kennedy inviting written confirmation of
                        assurances he had earlier given Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName>. President Kennedy's death created a hiatus in this
                        dialogue.</p>
                    <p>Israel's request for 500 new and advanced U.S. tanks and other offensive
                        weapons again raises the question of arms limitation in the area and our
                        ability to play a role. Before taking a decision on Israel's request, there
                        should be a further probe of <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s
                        willingness to consider general arms limitation. If some progress were made,
                        it would have a bearing on the decision and give us a basis for an approach
                        to Israel. If not, we would be in better position to justify to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> Israel's obtaining new tanks while
                        still leaving the door open for further efforts.</p>
                    <p>Rather than appoint a special emissary, I propose that <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Phillips Talbot</persName>, Assistant Secretary for
                        Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs, carry out the probe during his

                        problem. His designation would give us good cover and serve to avoid drawing

                    <p>The good relations we've built up with the Arabs are in increasing jeopardy,
                        primarily because in their frustration over their inability to stop Israel's
                        water diversion, they're lashing out at all Israel's friends. <pb n="44" xml:id="pg_44" facs="0076"/>This is why they reacted adversely to your
                        Weizmann speech; it will color their reaction to anything we say or do this

                    <p>Dear Mr. President:</p>
                    <p>I have carefully read your extensive correspondence with President Kennedy
                        and am struck by the degree of mutual respect and understanding it revealed.
                        I sensed also a genuine will to move forward in areas where we could, while
                        setting aside and working to limit the impact of those issues where we
                        necessarily disagreed. For my part I would like this sense of growing
                        confidence on both sides to continue, and to forestall the misconstruing of
                        each other's policies which has marred our relations in the past.</p>
                    <p>In this vein I want to assure you personally that we are as determined as
                        ever to carry forward policies of constructive cooperation, in the United
                        Nations and out, with other governments of like intent. Thus I look forward
                        to continued fruitful cooperation with your government and with the others
                        of the Middle East and to exchanging views with you on our mutual
                        interests.</p>
                    <p>I believe the main concern of leaders in all nations today must be to keep
                        the clouds of war from forming. The nuclear scientist has added new and
                        terrible dimensions to war, and only deep and abiding international
                        cooperation and understanding can make nuclear science a peaceful instead of
                        a military pursuit. You may rest assured that we remain opposed to nuclear
                        proliferation in any area of the world.</p>
                    <p>Since it is inevitable that nations will disagree, we believe we must try
                        diligently to make whatever progress is possible to settle issues in
                        dispute. Meanwhile we must concentrate on expanding areas of agreement. I
                        was heartened by the recent affirmation by Arab leaders meeting in Cairo of
                        the doctrine that nations should compose their differences by peaceful
                        means. We recognize the statesmanship that subordinated narrower grievances
                        to the common good and engendered a climate of cooperation among the various
                        Arab governments. We welcome the prospect of normalization in Yemen, of
                        temperance in the Arab-Israel problem, and of increasing the Arab League's
                        potential for constructive cooperation.</p>
                    <pb n="46" xml:id="pg_46" facs="0078"/>
                    <p>So I hope that in the coming months we can work together to enlarge the areas
                        of mutual interest and narrow those where we may disagree. In fact, I look
                        forward to the day when we can meet in person. Meanwhile I would like to
                        continue the frank and friendly dialogue that has already contributed to
                        understanding between our governments. The next few years will be a strain
                        on both of us, but the US and the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> have
                        so much to gain through good relations that we must both strive to maintain
                        and expand them rather than letting our two nations drift apart.</p>
                    <p>Sincerely,</p>

                        below:</p>
                    <p>(1) Basic theme should be that accelerated <gloss target="#t_NE1">NE</gloss>
                        arms race not in basic interest <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> or
                        Israel. Whatever ultimate purpose <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                        surface to surface missile program may be, has had unsettling effect and
                        viewed as new stage in <gloss target="#t_NE1">NE</gloss> arms race.</p>
                    <p>(2) For example, we and others continue be under constant Israeli pressure
                        provide all sorts weapons correct imbalances resulting from continued
                        acquisition Soviet arms by Arab countries and <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> weapons development. Our ability curb various Israeli
                        initiatives made more difficult particularly where obvious imbalances
                        occur.</p>
                    <p>(3) We following very closely Israel's progress in nuclear field. At this
                        time, no evidence Israel engaged in production nuclear weapon. However,
                        Israel may acquire capability make nuclear weapon at some future time.</p>
                    <p>(4) Missile race picking up steam. We have not viewed <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>'s <gloss target="#t_SSM1">SSM</gloss> effort as presenting
                        great threat as long as levels low. However, Israelis fearful Nasser's
                        missile goals, and intelligence indicates they intend taking steps redress
                        situation. If <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> develops large missile
                        force and Israel follows suit, this would be self-defeating exercise for
                        both countries.</p>
                    <p>(5) <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has been through similar experience
                        with Soviets. Though no major arms control agreements reached, <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> must have noticed both Soviets and
                        ourselves have sought limit further increases our military budgets.
                        Similarly, have both supported <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolution
                        last November concerning nuclear weapons in orbit. This was direction which
                        arms race could have been extended but neither side stood to gain. Control
                        by “mutual example” can serve interests of both US and Soviets during period
                        when formal agreements difficult to reach. We believe there is parallel for
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and Israel.</p>
                    <p>(6) What we seeking is means reduce possibility of chain reaction which would
                        ultimately require outside involvement in struggle which either Arabs or
                        Israelis might start but which neither could end. Must look other
                        alternatives:</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> said Israel now appeared to be
                        low on the list of urgent world problems. An early conflict in the Near East
                        seemed unlikely. The recent Cairo Summit Conference had opted for a course
                        of caution. Tense tranquility characterized the climate of the Near East.
                        The crisis remained since <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> was
                        giving increased public emphasis to the inevitability of an Arab-Israel war.
                        The upward spiral of the Near East arms race seemed impossible to stop.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> believed Israel had convinced
                        the U.S. that it had fallen behind in the Arab-Israel military balance.
                        Specifically, it was weak in armor. No agreement had been reached as yet on
                        the importance of the U.A.R. missile threat but it was safer to overestimate
                        than to underestimate.</p>
                    <p>A general spirit of Nasserist adventurism pervaded the area. U.A.R. forces in
                        Yemen had increased and Nasser had questioned the position of the West in
                        Libya. Nevertheless, Israel should welcome the present comparative serenity
                        in the Near East. Nothing was inevitable, even Nasser's predictions of
                        inevitable war. It was important, however, to preserve the arms balance.
                        Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> urged prompt
                        action on the Israeli request for tanks. He felt strongly that this issue
                        should not be linked to other aspects of Israel's military defense. The
                        provision of tanks was important both substantively and psychologically.
                        Israeli military officers believed the U.S. was sincere in its assurances to
                        protect Israel against aggression but doubted that the U.S. would take
                        prompt action in time of need. Response to Israel's request for tanks had
                        become a symbol of U.S. willingness to give concrete support to Israel
                        against aggression.</p>
                    <p>Israel's view of the dangers of the U.A.R. military build up was such that
                        even if it were possible to prove that a given number of missiles did not
                        constitute a significant military threat, it would be impossible to convince
                        the Israeli people. The problem was largely psychological and required more
                        discussion. Israel was prepared to pursue the matter further but meanwhile
                        hoped for prompt action on the matter of tanks.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary inquired whether Israel desired to purchase the tanks or hoped
                        for grant military assistance. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> replied that outright purchase would impose an
                        intolerable burden on Israel. The Israeli economy was intricate and its
                        seeming strength belied the strain that <pb n="51" xml:id="pg_51" facs="0083"/>such a financial burden would create. The Secretary
                        stressed the relevancy of the use of available Israeli resources for
                        acquisition of tanks. Grant assistance for tanks might conceivably permit
                        diversion of sufficient resources for Israel to acquire missiles.</p>
                    <p>Regarding the results of the Arab Summit Conference, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> said Israel had noted a surprising
                        consolidation of Hussein's position. Jordan's resumption of diplomatic
                        relations with the U.A.R. had made Hussein a respectable Arab nationalist
                        leader. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> had reached a less
                        ambitious concept of what he could do in the Arab world. He was more
                        prepared to live and let live. In Yemen, however, he was engaged more deeply
                        than ever. There were no indications that Syria could be worked into a union
                        with the U.A.R. Continuing instability there seemed likely.</p>
                    <p>With respect to the proposed Arab diversion of Jordan headwaters, the major
                        danger was from Syria. The positions of Jordan and Lebanon were ambivalent,
                        and the U.A.R. was not immediately concerned. Israel wished to play down the
                        Jordan waters off-take. Regarding the salinity problem, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> noted that off-take above Lake Tiberias
                        would have assured sweeter water. Israel, however, was accepting the
                        criteria of the Unified Plan and water usage as provided thereunder. Israel
                        greatly valued the U.S. support and agreed to the desirability of no
                        publicity. In recent talks with the United Nations Secretary General, the
                        latter had agreed that it would be undesirable to raise the Jordan waters
                        issue in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary expressed concern about the arms race in the Near East and the
                        backbreaking financial burden it created. He noted a tendency on the part of
                        the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. voluntarily to cut nuclear and other arms
                        production and wondered about a parallel desire on the part of the U.A.R.
                        and Israel. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> said disarmament
                        interested Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>
                        greatly. The U.A.R., however, had been the first on each occasion to
                        introduce a new level of weaponry into the Near East arms race.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> said the diffusion of power in
                        the world in recent years had resulted in increased possibilities for small
                        power conflicts. Large powers might wish to intervene but often felt unable
                        to do so for fear of far-reaching consequences. These circumstances led
                        Israeli military men to wonder about the ability of the U.S. to act promptly
                        in support of Israel. They hoped for more clear-cut indications of U.S.
                        intentions. The Secretary interjected that there was no automaticity in any
                        of our agreements to support our allies. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> said it was important, under the circumstances, to
                        build up indigenous forces and not to depend upon big power intervention.
                        This underlined the need for Israel's tanks. The Secretary said that since
                        the return of the Rowen mission from Israel he had had no opportunity to
                        discuss the matter with <pb n="52" xml:id="pg_52" facs="0084"/>the
                        President. He would do so shortly and be in touch with the Israel
                        Ambassador. We recognized Israel's needs but had problems of our own to
                        consider.</p>
                    <p>On the position of the U.S. in the Arab world, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> said it was safer for all concerned if U.S. influence
                        in the area remained strong. The recent speeches of President Johnson and
                            <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">U. Alexis Johnson</persName> had created
                        considerable uproar but the Arab states could not afford to ignore the
                        strength of the U.S. It was salutary occasionally to stress the idea of U.S.
                        opposition to aggression. The Secretary commented that the Arabs did not
                        share Israel's doubts as to our position on this score. The reaction to the
                        speeches showed that they were convinced of U.S. intent to oppose
                        aggression. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> agreed that the
                        military were never satisfied but said that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> saw the matter in terms of survival of the Jewish
                        people. It was not possible, therefore, to depend upon U.S. assurances
                        without tangible evidence to back them up.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said President Johnson looked forward to the coming visit of
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> and to the opportunity to
                        exchange views with him.</p>

                    <p>1994. Cane from Talbot. Nearly half my two hour conversation with Nasser
                        Tuesday evening<note n="2" xml:id="d24fn2">See <ref target="#d25">Document
                                25</ref>.</note> was devoted to arms questions. I told him President
                        Johnson had carefully reviewed earlier communications between him and
                        President Kennedy, along with reports of <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName>'s talks with him. <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> had emphasized US concerned with area stability and
                        diversion of resources into arms race. President Johnson was equally anxious
                        that in any way possible US shall help nations in this area to curb arms
                        race of weapons of mass destruction and conventional weapons. <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> and he had had candid talk on
                        missiles and nuclear proliferation, and, expressing President Johnson's deep
                        concern, I hoped we could discuss in all seriousness problem as it now
                        appeared. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> agreed and asked me
                        to proceed.</p>
                    <pb n="53" xml:id="pg_53" facs="0085"/>
                    <p>I said it seemed to us that accelerated Near East arms race was not in
                        interests of either <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> or Israel. In
                        particular, <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> development of
                        surface-to-surface missiles was having clearly unsettling effect. It was
                        seen by Israel and by other nations including US as new step in arms race.
                        We assumed that in view their mutual distrust, <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and Israel could not realistically agree now to reduce
                        existing conventional arms. However, decisions made now about this new stage
                        could influence course of arms race for years to come. We hoped he could
                        consider this matter very seriously.</p>
                    <p>I continued that we and other nations have been, and are, under constant
                        Israeli pressure to obtain weapons which in Israel's view needed to correct
                        imbalances deriving from <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> acquisition of
                        Soviet arms or development of its own weapons. Our ability to curb Israeli
                        appetites particularly difficult where obvious imbalances occur. Any
                        dangerous imbalance between two countries merely heightens the temptation
                        for pre-emptive attacks.</p>
                    <p>We have followed very closely, I said, Israel's progress in nuclear field. I
                        could say with full authority that at this time we have no evidence of
                        Israeli production of nuclear weapons. However, it would be possible for
                        Israel to acquire such capability in future. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> would recall how strongly President Kennedy had stood
                        against nuclear proliferation and he could be certain that President Johnson
                        just as firmly opposed to that dangerous course.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, it apparent that missile race picking up steam. In our people's
                        judgment, <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> surface-to-surface missiles—of
                        type described by <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> as improved V2's—might be
                        considerable psychological threat but would not have great military
                        importance so long as numbers were kept low. This was London's experience
                        under V2 attack in World War II. However, Israel is uncertain and fearful of
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> missile plans and our intelligence
                        indicates Israelis taking steps to redress situation. If numbers of missiles
                        kept low on both sides, problem might be largely psychological. However,
                        should <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> develop large missile force and
                        Israel follow suit two forces would obviously be selfdefeating, as we assume
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> would recognize. Problem
                        particularly acute because missilery, as we have reason to know, excessively
                        costly and yet we suppose that if competition really got going at this level
                        both <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and Israel would find means to
                        build up missile force.</p>
                    <p>I noted recent <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> experiences with <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Although no major arms control
                        agreements have been reached, US and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        have quietly sought to limit further increases in military budget. In future
                        they might find ways even to reduce military budgets. Obviously no formal
                        agreement involved here, but mutual restraint brought this result. Also,
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> would recall that US and
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> had concurred in prohibition of
                        nuclear weapons in Outer Space. Both countries could have orbited these
                        weapons <pb n="54" xml:id="pg_54" facs="0086"/>but neither stood to gain by
                        such action. These restraints by “mutual example” might, we felt, be useful
                        guides for <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and Israel.</p>
                    <p>What we were seeking, I said, are ways of reducing chances of chain reaction
                        which might be started by either Israel or <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> but could not be stopped by them and would be likely to
                        draw in other countries including major powers, with consequences <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> could readily perceive. Being much
                        concerned at such possibilities, we would like to suggest to him, for his
                        consideration and any response he might wish to make, several
                        alternatives.</p>
                    <p>One possibility would be a tacit understanding on limitation of missiles.
                        Some unobtrusive understanding on verification would of course be better way
                        to deal with possible development of surface-to-surface missiles and other
                        sophisticated weapons. However, recalling what <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> had said to <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> on this subject, we hope he would at least be willing
                        to explore possible mutual restraint. We see not only compelling military
                        reasons but very strong economic reasons for this course in both countries.
                        We would welcome an indication by <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> of willingness to limit numbers of <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> missiles.</p>
                    <p>Secondly, we hope Nasser has had opportunity to consider advantages to <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> of accepting <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards for future reactors. We are not asking Nasser
                        to change current <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> practice. Safeguards
                        would apply only to any larger reactor it might build in future. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> knew that India has agreed to
                        principle of <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> inspection of Tarapur. It
                        seems to us that for <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> to take
                        similar step would be no derogation of sovereignty, as he had suggested to
                            <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName>, but rather a highly
                        responsible use of sovereignty to reinforce system of safeguards which if
                        generally adopted could benefit whole of mankind. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s agreement in principle would not
                        only be powerful action in support of <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>
                        principles, but it would also give other nations, including U.S., sturdy
                        leverage to apply to current Israeli reluctance to place its Dimona reactor
                        under <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>. Should Israel resist these
                        safeguards after their acceptance by <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, U.S. would have basis for questioning Israeli
                        nuclear policy.</p>
                    <p>As another suggestion I recalled the draft letter that President Kennedy had
                        promised [proposed] last October<note n="3" xml:id="d24fn3">For text of
                            Kennedy's proposed draft letter, transmitted to Cairo on September 12,
                            1963, and given to Nasser by <persName corresp="#p_BJS1">Badeau</persName> on October 5, and Nasser's reaction, see <ref target="frus1961-63v18#d324">
                                <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1961–1963, vol. XVIII,
                                Documents 324</ref> and <ref target="frus1961-63v18#d325">325</ref>.</note> and said President Johnson would welcome a letter
                        from President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> stating <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> has no intention of developing or acquiring
                        nuclear weapons. In our opinion public exchange of this sort would be
                        statesmanlike advance.</p>
                    <p>Finally, President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> had
                        mentioned to <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> possibility of
                        collective agreements. We do not know exactly what he had in mind, <pb n="55" xml:id="pg_55" facs="0087"/>but we have continued working at
                        nuclear weapons problem on broader basis in Geneva. It has occurred to us
                        that <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> might helpfully state its own
                        position in that forum on non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.</p>
                    <p>If <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> had any other ideas about
                        how to proceed, I said we would be very glad to hear of them as well. In
                        conclusion, I expressed hope I had successfully conveyed President Johnson's
                        deep concern over problems of missile escalation of possible nuclear weapons
                        development. We found it difficult to see how entry into new and costly
                        phases of arms race could serve <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>'s desire
                        to strengthen its own independent role in world, for dangers of
                        sophisticated weaponry so great that any hostilities involving them could
                        very well draw in large powers seeking restrict any aggression. As one who
                        understands these problems well, <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, we hope, can see how much better it would be if ways
                        could be found to exercise positive restraints in field of missiles and
                        other sophisticated weaponry.</p>
                    <p>With apologies for length of my presentation, I invited <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> comment as he might desire. He
                        started by observing that once again heart of problem between US and <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> was Israel. It seemed always this way, he
                        said. He thought his position had been made clear in his talks with
                            <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BJS1">Badeau</persName>. The <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> had to maintain its defenses. It did not trust Israel. It
                        had been told before that Israel might agree to certain actions, but had
                        been fooled. In 1955 the US had talked about getting some balance between
                        Israel's forces and all Arab forces, but Israel had moved into Sinai and
                        suddenly fallen upon <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> units there. The
                        first news he and his officers had heard of this was conveyed by an Israeli
                        broadcast. None of them could forget those days of 1956. There was no point,
                        therefore, in discussing limitation of arms, because <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and all Arabs just cannot trust Israel.</p>
                    <p>I pointed out we not talking about cutting back existing weapons. We
                        understand lack of trust which prevents effective discussions directed
                        toward limiting existing arms. Our central concern is for limitation of
                        missiles and other sophisticated weapons yet to become operational.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> said <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> had gone into missile program in 1960 to develop deterrent
                        against growing Israeli strength. He had also started building aircraft
                        then. He felt <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> must develop its own
                        aircraft and missiles because at that time Soviets, with whom <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> had some disputes, was refusing provide
                        spare parts and otherwise making clear they not completely trustworthy
                        source of arms. <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> had sought arms
                        elsewhere, including US, without success; therefore he felt <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> had no choice but to develop its own planes
                        and missiles.</p>
                    <p>He could not tell me about numbers of missiles, <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> said, because <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> has
                        no plan yet. He is not thinking now in terms <pb n="56" xml:id="pg_56" facs="0088"/>of numbers. His first job is to increase quality of their
                        performance. So far they have not been very accurate, and inaccurate
                        missiles aimed at Israel might hit Jerusalem or Amman.</p>
                    <p>I observed that Israelis are disturbed because they seem to think <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> preparing to produce missiles in the
                        hundreds. I said if it were matter of only small number, just possible
                        Israelis also might limit themselves to small number. Could <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> give me idea of range of <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> planning? He regretted that he could not,
                        for reason just stated.</p>
                    <p>He observed I had said missiles might have psychological impact but not much
                        military effect in small numbers. As military man he agreed with this. With
                        conventional warheads missiles could deliver only a ton or so of explosives.
                        Aircraft might be more effective. But now of course Israel getting Hawks
                        from US, so aircraft alone no longer much deterrent. I pointed out Hawk
                        purely defensive and would not protect Israeli forces should they attack
                        outside Israeli borders. He turned that aside by commenting that <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> has not also obtained <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss>'s, from Soviets. These are extremely
                        expensive, and <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> could not hope to cover
                        whole country or even all important spots, as could Israel with US-purchased
                            <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss>'s. Indeed, <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> vulnerable because unlike US it does not have full radar
                        coverage of frontiers. These deficiencies increase <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> need for deterrent. I argued <gloss target="#t_SSM1">SSM</gloss>'s of type he described not really deterrent especially as
                        their development would almost certainly cause Israelis to develop or
                        acquire their own <gloss target="#t_SSM1">SSM</gloss>'s, which could be
                        quite sophisticated. Returning to question of numbers of SSM's contemplated
                        by <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, I again got no answer.</p>
                    <p>Nuclear weapons are another matter, <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> said, as he had told <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BJS1">Badeau</persName>. <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> has no intention
                        of developing nuclear weapons. In any case <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> lacks necessary resources; for example, it has no source of
                        plutonium, as does Israel.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> also observed that strategic
                        nuclear weapons—“I know only of them, I don't know about tactical nuclear
                        weapons”—could probably not be used against Israel anyway because it is such
                        small country. As it only 1520 kilometers wide at some points, strategic
                        nuclear bomb might easily spread destruction partly in Arab lands outside
                        Israel. He would consider what to say about not intending to develop or
                        secure nuclear weapons. Perhaps he could state this in a letter to President
                        Johnson, as we had suggested. They had looked at Kennedy draft letter and
                        had found some difficulties in it, but they could consider matter again and
                        see if such a letter could be sent.</p>
                    <p>As to <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards, he thought it might
                        be possible for <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> to accept these at
                        appropriate time. <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> is now seeking to
                        construct large nuclear reactor for peaceful purposes. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BJS1">Badeau</persName> asked whether arrangements for
                        electrical power from Aswan Dam would not be adequate for some time to come.
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> said point is <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> feels <pb n="57" xml:id="pg_57" facs="0089"/>must get into nuclear age in good time. It was late getting into
                        industrial revolution and into electrical age. It does not want to be late
                        again even though nuclear power may cost more than other forms. Perhaps at
                        time of arranging for new reactor <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> could
                        announce its acceptance of <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards.
                        He thought this might be possible. I asked him about timing, explaining this
                        was of interest since question of Israeli action on <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards for its larger reactor was already at hand. He
                        said he did not know when <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> would reach
                        this stage. He left me with impression, however, that he got the point.</p>
                    <p>I went after him again on numbers of missiles as a basis for some tacit
                        understanding on limitation of numbers, with the same negative results as
                        before. As conversation was beginning to get repetitive, I dropped it at
                        that point.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> Ambassador and I believe there may be some
                        significance in <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s indication
                        he may be prepared write letter to President stating <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> intention not to develop or acquire nuclear weapons. This
                        was clearest indication we got that he did not consider Cane exercise
                        necessarily closed with President Kennedy's death. We also feel his
                        willingness talk about <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards for
                        future reactors may reflect recognition that Tarapur pattern may now be
                        adopted by nations giving assistance for building reactors in developing
                        countries. My failure to budge him on missiles does not necessarily signify
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> yet committed to produce large
                        numbers, Ambassador and I feel. Assuming <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                        is in fact still facing serious technical problems in missile development,
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> may not wish expose his
                        hand until situation clear. Alternatively, he may not wish to give up this
                        bargaining counter at this stage in exercises.</p>
                    <p>I would like to feel that net result is some give on <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards and possible acceptance of idea of committing
                        himself in letter to President on non-proliferation. However, his repeated
                        references to Israel arms suggests his willingness proceed along these lines
                        could be withheld if he comes to believe US changing its restraint on arms
                        provided Israel.</p>

                    <p>1995. From Talbot. Accompanied by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BJS1">Badeau</persName> I had two hour discussion with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> on Tuesday<note n="2" xml:id="d25fn2">March 3. See also <ref target="#d24">Document
                            24</ref>.</note> evening. Throughout conversation he was cordial,
                        quiet-voiced, and apparently relaxed. He repeatedly referred to Israel as
                        the main irritant in U.S.-<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> relations,
                        suggesting that U.S. policies in election year much on his mind. He clearly
                        appreciated hearing directly from President.</p>
                    <p>I opened by presenting letters from Mrs. Kennedy and from the President.<note n="3" xml:id="d25fn3">
                            <ref target="#d20">Document 20</ref>. The letter from Mrs. Kennedy has
                            not been found.</note>
                        <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> laid aside Mrs. Kennedy's
                        letter for later reading but opened President's letter and read it through
                        slowly and carefully. I then said I had come in expression President's
                        desire continue full and frank discussion that had characterized President
                        Kennedy's relations with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>.
                        President Johnson, who had sat at his predecessor's side as Kennedy
                        administration policies shaped, had carefully reviewed our Near Eastern
                        policy.</p>
                    <p>Recognizing problems that necessarily affect our relationships, he was ready
                        to pursue effective relations with <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>,
                        seeking ways to resolve problems and where possible working to broaden areas
                        of common interest.</p>
                    <p>I said Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BJS1">Badeau</persName> had already
                        spoken to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> about continuity of
                        U.S. policies, and we hoped he understood our readiness to continue
                        cooperation in economic and other fields. We were glad of contribution
                        American cereals making to meeting Egypt's consumption requirements and that
                        proceeds from their sale also helping meet investment gap. As we had told
                        Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KAM2">Kaissouni</persName> during his very recent
                        visit to Washington, we also were prepared as matter of practice carry on
                        with development lending. There were, indeed, some problems to be overcome
                        first, but Nasser would understand importance meeting these problems, such
                        as International Monetary Fund terms for stabilization agreement. In fact
                        friends of <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, both governmental and
                        non-governmental, had come believe <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>
                        agreement to be central accomplishment necessary for further development
                        assistance. However, our willingness in principle to negotiate loans
                        remained as before.</p>
                    <p>I commented on recent Cairo summit conference, saying we impressed by
                        moderate and statesmanlike management of meeting, applaud <pb n="59" xml:id="pg_59" facs="0091"/>Arab decision to use peaceful means to
                        resolve disputes, commend reduction of tensions apparent between several
                        Arab states and governments, and hope some improvement in <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_SAG1">SAG</gloss>
                        relations might also result.</p>
                    <p>I said this opportunity discuss broad field of U.S.-<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> relations with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> emboldened me mention several issues which would
                        probably face us in course this year. One, of course, was refugee problem.
                        As he knew, for three years we had exerted strong efforts to deal with this
                        difficult, seemingly intractable problem.</p>
                    <p>As no overall solution found in past 15 years, we had hoped some step-by-step
                        arrangement might help start process by which genuine progress could
                        gradually be achieved. We now had impression Israel might take in some
                        refugees, but in absence understanding of what Arab side would be willing to
                        do, we found it difficult to press forward with this initiative. We had
                        tried energetically to find path toward implementation of Paragraph 11 of
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Resolution 194.<note n="4" xml:id="d25fn4">Resolution 194 (III), adopted by the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> General Assembly on December 11, 1948,
                            established a Conciliation Commission for Palestine and instructed it on
                            various subjects. Paragraph 11 resolved that refugees wishing to return
                            to their homes should be permitted to do so and that compensation should
                            be paid for the property of those choosing not to return. It also
                            instructed the Conciliation Commission to facilitate the repatriation,
                            resettlement, and economic and social rehabilitation of the refugees and
                            the payment of compensation.</note> In autumn we would be facing
                        question of termination of <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss>, with
                        anticipated debate over future of Palestine refugees. If, by that time no
                        progress made, situation would be difficult. He could understand we would
                        find it hard continue status quo indefinitely.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> responded that, as he had said
                        before, we have few problems in our direct relations. Troubles arise out of
                        third party issues. First among difficulties in our relations has been, and
                        continues to be, Israel. As he had said in recent speech, US had always
                        supported Israel and had supported status quo. Arabs could not accept this.
                        Arab-Israel problem could never be settled until Arabs got their rights.
                        Refugees have right to return to Palestine homeland. Dr. Joseph Johnson
                           <note n="5" xml:id="d25fn5"> Joseph E. Johnson was appointed Special

                        would be intolerable for them. At present Israel with more than 2,000,000
                        Jews has about 250,000 Arabs, who live under martial law restrictions as
                        second class citizens. If all refugees returned, there would be more than
                        1,000,000 Arabs in country and balance between communities would be
                        better.</p>
                    <p>Returning to subject of refugees later, <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> said it seems insoluble problem. It cannot be solved
                        by war nor can it be solved by peaceful <pb n="60" xml:id="pg_60" facs="0092"/>means because Israel will not give Arabs their rights. I
                        noted Dr. Johnson had withdrawn illustrative figure of 20,000 refugees; what
                        he really sought was a process that might progress so long as both sides
                        were willing. In absence of agreement on final solution, step-by-step
                        process seemed only path to progress. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> said Arabs could not accept this nibbling at problem.
                        I said we all would need in coming months look carefully for ways to
                        progress, else there could be great difficulties ahead. He assented with
                        smile.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> returned to theme that US
                        supporting status quo to protect Israel. I said I thought he underrated US
                        efforts to work constructively with all nations in area. This was our policy
                        with <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, as he knew. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> said he agreed. President Kennedy
                        had worked for peace, but then after latter's death had come new policy
                        statements by Alexis Johnson and President Johnson which troubled Arabs.
                        Perhaps exact wordings used should not have caused anxiety; this had already
                        been explained to him. But Arabs are sentimental people and had felt hurt at
                        these speeches coming right after Arab summit, which praised Israel and had
                        no warm words for Arabs. I commented that Alexis Johnson's speech, scheduled
                        before we knew of summit meeting, had been effort to state carefully the
                        various considerations in American Near Eastern policy at beginning this
                        important year. Careful reading of President Johnson's speech would show
                        that American assistance in study of desalting was explicitly extended to
                        any interested country. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BJS1">Badeau</persName> noted that American desalting specialist had in fact
                        been working with <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> specialists in past
                        year.</p>
                    <p>[Here follows discussion concerning Yemen and Cyprus.]</p>
                    <p>I noted that we had been disappointed to hear his reference to American base
                        in Libya. We felt he knew US policy of support of freedom and independence
                        of Near Eastern countries and we were surprised at his mention of a matter
                        really peripheral to US–<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> relations since
                        we had thought both countries seeking to broaden area of common effort.
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> responded that as we well
                        knew he doesn't like system of bases anywhere in world. He had mentioned
                        bases in this speech and had identified British bases, so he referred to
                        American base also. He had been thinking primarily of our support of Israel,
                        and this was a connected question.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> At several points in conversation <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> found ways to reinforce impression
                        he obviously sought to convey that what we are doing for Israel is on his
                        mind in this election year. He gave appearance of willingness discuss any
                        subject and suggested, as I did, that this sort of candid review helpful in
                        our relations. In parting he asked me express his best wishes to President
                        Johnson and said he would be replying to President's letter.</p>

                    <p>In a most relaxed, low-key discussion Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> and <persName>Bundy</persName> exchanged thoughts on
                        Israel's need to redress the imbalance between Israeli and Arab armor, and
                        the pros and cons of further escalation of the arms race. Eban said that he
                        was not here primarily on security business; nevertheless he hoped to
                        contribute to narrowing any points of difference between us before the
                            <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> visit, as the President had
                        suggested in his letter to <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>. The
                        latter was of course looking forward very much to the visit.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> did not dwell on the tank
                        problem, commenting that we seemed to be in agreement on the need. It was
                        the Arabs who invariably started the parade by acquiring new weapons
                        systems, and Israel which generally followed. He cited jets and submarines
                        as cases in point. Moreover, Israel had seen in the Hawk sale US acceptance
                        of the principle that we would not allow an arms imbalance to develop.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> did stress, however, the
                        importance of not linking the tank and missile questions. These were two
                        quite different matters. If Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>
                        could be given favorable word on tanks when he came, this would create the
                        right atmosphere for further productive discussions on other matters. He and
                            <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> both urged that we not
                        attempt to deal simultaneously with an immediate and clear-cut question such
                        as tanks, and a murky issue which was not immediate and on which the <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> had explained to Mr. Rowen the Israeli
                        views.</p>
                    <p>As to missiles, <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> acknowledged the
                        gap between Israeli and US estimates. But he emphasized that despite the
                        limited military value of <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> missiles they
                        presented a real psychological hazard, especially to a small, beleaguered
                        nation like Israel. In response to <persName>Bundy</persName>'s query, he
                        said that the purpose of Israeli missiles would be deterrence via <pb n="62" xml:id="pg_62" facs="0094"/>threat of retaliation against Cairo. Israel
                        needed a psychological counter which would both bolster popular morale and
                        deter <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> from thinking he could
                        disrupt Israel with a bomber and missile attack while the US was making up
                        its mind.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Bundy</persName> rehearsed the arguments as to why we saw
                        potentially great costs and risks to Israel's moving ahead in this field.
                        The <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> missiles of today seemed to be more
                        for parades than a serious military weapon, though we saw force in the
                        argument that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> might
                        over-estimate his own strength. Quite candidly, however, what greatly
                        concerned us were the implications of Israel, with an acknowledged nuclear
                        potential, moving to acquire a delivery system which made real sense only
                        with nuclear warheads. Whether or not Israel had any such intention, the
                        Arabs could hardly be expected not to draw this conclusion. What they might
                        do then was deeply disturbing. By now Israel should be fully reassured as to
                        the firmness of US support; the one thing that might upset this increasingly
                        close relationship would be US belief that Israel was moving in the
                        direction of a nuclear deterrent. Yet Israel's lack of candor in explaining
                        its missile program generated suspicions which should be laid to rest.</p>
                    <p>The most significant aspect of the discussion centered around the
                        relationship of tanks and missiles. <persName>Bundy</persName> explained
                        that we were not trying to link the two questions in any attempt at oriental
                        bargaining. What we were trying to say was that we were deeply concerned
                        over both these aspects of Israel's security problem—precisely because both
                        aspects could also deeply involve us. We felt a bit as though Israel was not
                        confiding in us about its missile intentions because it feared our reaction;
                        this in turn made us suspicious that Israel simply wanted to postpone the
                        matter until after the tanks were settled, and then tell us that it proposed
                        to go ahead on a course which could have a deeply unsettling effect on our
                        relationship. The US should not say “it won't do A without B”, nor Israel
                        say “we won't talk about B unless you do A.” All we could ask was a rational
                        approach; they should not insist we separate the two issues or have no
                        discussion, and we shouldn't insist we link them or have no discussion. We
                        should go ahead on both problems as a mark of mutual confidence. He couldn't
                        exaggerate the importance of coming to a harmonious view on these
                        issues.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> both saw tanks as the “test” of our commitment in
                        Israeli eyes. If the US were unwilling to help meet an agreed need, it would
                        powerfully reinforce the views of those skeptics who felt that Israel could
                        not rely on the US commitment. <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName>
                        had again been impressed on this visit, as by past experience here and the
                        Kennedy and Johnson letters, with the extent to which Washington stood
                        firmly behind its words. But we had to reckon with the psychological
                        problem—the fact that our assurances were so private and informal lessened
                            <pb n="63" xml:id="pg_63" facs="0095"/>their credibility. Moreover,
                        Israelis closely followed such situations as Cyprus, Vietnam, Malaysia; when
                        they saw the inhibitions on the use of US power, though everyone knew the US
                        had an abundance of power, this raised doubts. Others feared that our
                        tendency to push the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to the fore in a
                        crisis might lead us down this road at a time when Israel's critical need
                        dictated a quick response.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Bundy</persName> made clear that we fully understood these
                        concerns; we could well realize how a beleaguered Israel might worry over
                        the US response. As one of the custodians of nuclear power (which some of us
                        had grown increasingly to wish we hadn't brought into the world), we were
                        very cautious about the responsible use of such power. This of course was
                        one reason why we were so opposed to nuclear proliferation, and felt that
                        steps by Israel which might seem to be creating a new nuclear dimension in
                        the Middle East could so affect US policy as to force us to rethink it. In
                        short, the way to make certain our commitment was unreliable might be to act
                        as if one couldn't rely on it.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> raised another question as to how
                        to give credibility to our assurances that we could come quickly to Israel's
                        aid if necessary. When General Rabin, the new Israeli <gloss target="#t_CS1">C/S</gloss>, had been here, he was “impressed as a citizen” but
                        concerned as a soldier with the vagueness of US protestations that we could
                        come quickly and effectively to Israel's support. To military men precision
                        was essential. He realized the problems “joint planning” might give us, but
                        hoped something could be done to facilitate clear, operational
                        understandings. Bundy felt that “joint planning” didn't prove very much. Our
                        military were understandably reluctant to get pinned down to plans that
                        rarely fitted the real case when it arose, yet robbed us of flexibility and
                        often generated argument and mistrust.</p>
                    <p>The problem of possible arms limitations was also discussed, with neither
                            <persName>Bundy</persName> nor <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> very optimistic over this route. <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> stressed <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>'s deep desire to find some way to forestall the
                        constant piling up of arms which cancelled each other out. This was a
                        terrible waste, aside from the grave risks. Perhaps something might emerge
                        from the Geneva talks. Did we see much chance of convincing the Arabs that
                        some sort of a standstill would be mutually advantageous? <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> might want to raise this question
                        when here.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Bundy</persName> guardedly indicated that we didn't see many signs
                        to date of Arab interest, but all of us were undergoing a process of
                        education along these lines, witness the US and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. If we felt that we had something to go on from the
                        Israeli side, it would certainly enhance our desire to keep trying. Here
                            <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>'s refusal to let us
                        reassure <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> that Israel wasn't
                        going nuclear tended to tie our hands. If the Arabs, already worried about
                        Israel's nuclear capacity, were to see missiles <pb n="64" xml:id="pg_64" facs="0096"/>(which were not much use without nuclear warheads) added to
                        the arsenal, this might create quite a problem.</p>
                    <p>At <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName>'s request
                            <persName>Bundy</persName> gave some background on our Vietnam policy.
                        There was also a brief allusion to Cyprus, Libya, and the repeated Arab
                        statements of hostility toward Israel. All agreed that such words were
                        generally a substitute for action, but they did serve to keep the pot
                        boiling.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_JWW1">Walter Jenkins</persName> has passed to me the
                        attached memo from Mike <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName>
                        <note n="2" xml:id="d27fn2">Not printed. The March 4 memorandum from Myer
                                <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> to the President
                            stated that he had met with several Congressmen who expressed
                            dissatisfaction with stories they had heard of U.S. reluctance to sell
                            tanks to Israel. He stated that if the United States was going to supply
                            tanks, it would be a mistake to wait too long before announcing
                            it.</note> about tanks for Israel and told me that you would like to
                        have a recommendation. It happens that I have been talking in recent days
                        with both State and Defense on this matter so that I am able to give you a
                        prompt answer.</p>
                    <p>It has been our position, as you know, that we would not make a firm decision
                        on tanks for Israel until later in the year. Mike <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> feels strongly the other way, in part for reasons
                        stated in his memorandum and in part because he quite naturally would like
                        to be able to carry this decision with him on his visit to Israel later this
                        month. Our current problem is simply that the Arabs are in an excited frame
                        of mind and are likely to get more excited later this spring and summer as
                        Israel begins to use the Jordan waters. Moreover, the Israelis have been
                        very reluctant to deal frankly with us on their apparent desire to buy
                        surface-to-surface missiles from the French, a move which we think full of
                        danger for them and for us. The Israelis have a nuclear reactor <pb n="65" xml:id="pg_65" facs="0097"/>which could make plutonium, and if they buy
                        modern missiles from the French we may have a wholly new level of escalation
                        in the Middle East arms race. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s missiles, by contrast, are both conventional and clumsy
                        and are more for show than for use.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName> and I feel very strongly that
                        it would be wrong to make a commitment on the tanks now, and that you should
                        reserve decision until Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> comes. <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName>, who ought to know his New York vote, agrees with
                        us. The State Department, below <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>,
                        feels strongly the same way, but <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>
                        himself is more of the view that the matter is already decided in principle
                        and that you can make your own political choice as to when to tell the
                        Israelis. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> is also quite
                        pragmatic about it, as a tank merchant, and I do not think that he has
                        concentrated on the politics of missiles or the politics of Arab reaction. I
                        am not sure that either <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> or
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> has seen the very strongly
                        worded cables from all our Ambassadors in the Arab countries warning of the
                        violent reaction to any tank deal.</p>
                    <p>On balance, I recommend that you continue to push this decision ahead of you,
                        and that we indicate firmly to our Israeli friends the grave impropriety of
                        turning any Republicans loose on this point while the missile matter is
                        unsettled. My own guess is that if the Israeli missile issue were to get
                        into the public domain, there would be a very serious backlash of criticism
                        against the Israelis. I think we should deal with this by quiet diplomacy if
                        possible, and much the best time for a full-scale review of it is your
                        meeting with <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> in June.</p>
                    <p>If you agree that we ought to wait, I suggest that you sign the enclosed
                            <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss>, but before we support it, I would
                        wish to talk with Mike <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> and try
                        to get him to agree why it is important to wait. Let me add, finally, that
                        if we hastily give in on something as difficult as the tank deal in March, I
                        hate to think what we will be asked for between now and November. The
                        Israelis use all sources of pressure in an election year, and the heat is
                        really quite low so far.</p>

                        the Joint Chiefs of Staff regarding certain questions posed in a letter by
                        the Deputy Under Secretary of State, dated 8 <pb n="67" xml:id="pg_67" facs="0099"/>February 1964.<note n="2" xml:id="d28fn2">The memorandum
                            from <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName> to the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> Chairman and the letter from <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">U. Alexis Johnson</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName> are not printed. (Both
                            ibid.)</note> These questions, concerning the desirability of selling
                        tanks to Israel, are:</p>
                    <p>a. Whether a significant imbalance exists in the relative strengths of the
                        Arab-Israeli military forces;</p>
                    <p>b. The need for Israel to augment its tank strength;</p>
                    <p>c. The need for modernization of Israel's tank force; and</p>
                    <p>d. Possible substitution of antitank weapons that would meet Israel's
                        needs.</p>
                    <p>2. A significant imbalance in the relative strengths of Arab and Israeli
                        military forces does not exist at this time.</p>
                    <p>a. Though superior in total numbers and hardware, the Arabs trail Israel in
                        quality and experience of leadership, in the level of general educational
                        and technical background among the enlisted ranks, in mobilization
                        capability, and in incentive to fight. The serious political differences and
                        jealousies of the Arabs make effective combined military action against
                        Israel highly unlikely. Israel will probably retain its over-all military
                        superiority vis-a-vis the Arab States for the next several years.</p>
                    <p>b. Apart from such estimates of over-all capabilities, Israel's concern about
                        tanks is justified. Israel cannot be complacent, for example, in knowing
                        that Egypt has moved from a position of tank disadvantage to advantage in a
                        period of five years. Egypt has moved far ahead in tank quality and has
                        increased its tank inventory from 322 to 739, while Israel's has increased
                        from 626 to 798.</p>
                    <p>3. There is no need for Israel to augment its tank strength at this time.
                        Current force levels and equipment levels are adequate for the defense of
                        Israel in the light of announced US policies and Arab disunity and
                        weaknesses. With the ability to mobilize to a strength of 250,000 in two
                        d4ays, Israeli forces can continue to counter Arab threats as long as such
                        forces are well led, trained, and equipped.</p>
                    <p>4. There is a military need for Israel to modernize its tank force because
                        the bulk of its tank inventory is obsolescent. The Arabs (Egypt, Syria,
                        Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, and Iraq) have already gained a favorable
                        modernization differential as well as a numerical advantage, and they are
                        gradually improving their training and maintenance. Thus, Israel needs to
                        replace obsolete M–4 tanks in order to counter Arab T–34s, T–54s, and
                        JS–3s.</p>
                    <p>5. With reference to the question of substituting antitank weapons for tanks,
                        it must be noted that these weapons are complementary to each other. Even
                        though a nation may have adopted a defense strategy, there is a requirement
                        for an offensive tactical capability to repel and, if necessary, eject enemy
                        forces which have penetrated its territory. <pb n="68" xml:id="pg_68" facs="0100"/>Thus, Israel has a need for an appropriate mix of tanks and
                        antitank weapons in order to maintain a balanced military force.</p>

                        that we make the decision as soon as possible as to whether or not we are

                        under which they will be acquired.</p>
                    <p>If it is decided that we should supply the tanks, I should like to be able to
                        convey this decision, in confidence, to the leaders of the Jewish community.
                        They have shown in the past that they can keep a secret.</p>

                    <p rend="center">TANKS FOR ISRAEL</p>
                    <p>In an earlier memorandum I set forth the political problems we might face if
                        the decision was deferred too long. There are foreign policy aspects to the
                        delay which are even more important.</p>
                    <p>It seems to me that the logic in favor of providing tanks for the Israeli
                        armed forces is inexorable. In view of the commitments expressed many times
                        by many Presidents to come to the assistance of Israel if she is attacked,
                        our basic policy must be directed toward the prevention of any aggression.
                        Our policy must be such that American intervention will not be
                        necessary.</p>
                    <pb n="70" xml:id="pg_70" facs="0102"/>
                    <p>Basic to the prevention of war is the maintenance of a balance of forces
                        between Israel and her neighbors. There is no doubt of the growing
                        preponderance of Arab tank strength. Nor is there any question about the
                        Israeli need for modern tanks if Israel is to be able to meet the military
                        threat posed by Russian tanks in Arab hands. Israel feels she must have at
                        least half as many tanks as Egypt. I believe that everyone who has
                        considered this problem believes that the balance of forces needed to
                        prevent conflict requires that a means be found to provide the Israeli
                        Government with between 300 and 500 modern tanks.</p>
                    <p>There are four problems:</p>
                    <p>1. It is said that any announcement indicating American military support for
                        the Israeli army would disrupt our relationships with the Arab nations. I
                        must confess that I am somewhat skeptical of this argument. I have heard it
                        in connection with every American action designed to give comfort to Israel.
                        We should remember that most of the nations depend upon us for large-scale
                        aid. I notice that, even so, they more often support the Soviet Union than
                        the United States in the United Nations. I read their constant denunciations
                        of American imperialism; and I am more inclined to believe that firmness
                        will attract respect than that concessions will win their favor.</p>
                    <p>Anyhow, if carried too far, this argument will result in actions justifying
                        and encouraging forces in Israel, which have had very little success thus
                        far, that are much more militant.</p>
                    <p>2. It is said that a decision should be deferred as long as possible. We have
                        already waited five months. These are long-lead time contracts. Unless the
                        Israeli Government receives some indication that American tanks may be
                        provided, it will be compelled to make its plans on the basis of other
                        assumptions. Already, I understand, they have agreed to purchase 90 British
                        tanks.</p>
                    <p>Those who favor letting the Israeli Government purchase their tanks elsewhere
                        overlook the shock to American-Israeli relationships which would result from
                        our action, the balance of payments effects and, most important, the
                        inability of the Israeli Government to purchase any substantial number of
                        tanks if they are sold on the usual terms for military purchases. Besides,
                        ours are the best tanks. To prevent war, these tanks are needed before the
                        disparity between Egyptian and Israeli equipment becomes too great.</p>
                    <p>3. There is some feeling that we should not agree to the tank sale unless the
                        Israeli Government gives up its intention to purchase ground-to-ground
                        missiles. I find myself sympathetic with this position. However, it is
                        difficult to tell a sovereign power what weapons it needs for its defense.
                        The existence of Egyptian missiles and the fact that the Israeli Government
                        has already contracted for 25 experimental <pb n="71" xml:id="pg_71" facs="0103"/>missiles from France makes it impossible to condition the
                        sale of tanks upon a renunciation of missiles.</p>
                    <p>But there are two alternatives. First, Israel could give up its right to
                        missiles of any kind, including Hawks, if Egypt would enter into a similar
                        agreement. Israel would agree to this, but there is little chance that Egypt
                        will.</p>
                    <p>Second, we might be able to persuade Israel to refrain from any further
                        purchases of missiles without prior consultation with us. In order to do
                        this, however, it would be necessary for me to explore the question frankly
                        and candidly with Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>, and I would have to know what we might be prepared
                        to do in consideration for such an understanding.</p>
                    <p>4. Finally, and most important of all, there is the problem of terms of sale.
                        Assuming it is decided that we supply Israel with the tanks, a 500 tank
                        order would cost in the neighborhood of $75 million. This is a staggering
                        sum for a country with a total budget of only $1 billion. The Israeli
                        Government has asked for grant aid. We have explored various other kinds of
                        assistance in the past; we have often increased the amount of development
                        loans in order to free funds for the purchase of military equipment. But
                        with the steadily decreasing foreign aid appropriations this is becoming
                        increasingly difficult. Thus far I have seen no proposal looking toward the
                        solution of this problem.</p>

                    <p>I still think the best way to go ahead with this issue is to push any
                        decision ahead of us. I think we should use Mike <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName>'s April visit to Israel as a reconnaissance in
                        force, providing him with a detailed set of probing questions and comments,
                        but carefully withholding any U.S. Government decision on the ground that
                        such decision should await the meeting between President Johnson and Prime
                        Minister <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>.</p>

                            agreement to drop the use of “Jerusalem, Palestine” in passports issued
                            or renewed in Jerusalem and issued to officers stationed in Jerusalem.
                            Davies strongly protested Israel's refusal to honor Consul Robert H.
                            Munn's passport, which contained this usage. (Ibid.) A chronology of
                            discussions on this subject, dating back to February 1963, is attached
                            to A–104 from Jerusalem, March 30. (Ibid.)</note> as most expedient way
                        to resolve issue, i.e., proposal that we issue Munn second passport without
                        designation Palestine which Israel Embassy will visa and return to Dept for
                        disposition. <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> would then issue
                        border-crossing permit against Israel Embassy visa number, but Munn would
                        retain his present passport.</p>
                    <p>2. We will cease using “Palestine” in passports as place of assignment and
                        cease issuing, renewing, or amending passports with seal bearing word
                        “Palestine”.</p>
                    <p>3. If there are no adverse repercussions from foregoing, we will change
                        listing of Jerusalem Consulate General in Foreign Service List so that it
                        would be listed under Jerusalem rather than Palestine.</p>

                        difficult for us to carry out additional steps now contemplated to

                    <p>Dear Mr. Prime Minister:</p>
                    <p>I am distressed to learn from Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Barbour</persName> that you feel unable to approve of our reassuring
                        President Nasser about the peaceful character of the Dimona reactor.<note n="2" xml:id="d31fn2">Telegrams 916 and 919 from Tel Aviv, March 3 and

                            apprehension as to Israel's nuclear potential would serve as a useful
                            deterrent to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>. (National

                            59, Central Files 1964–66, AE 11–2 ISR)</note> We are far from confident
                        that apprehension as to Israel's atomic potential will, as you suggest, help
                        deter <pb n="74" xml:id="pg_74" facs="0106"/>
                        <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> from attacking Israel. Quite
                        the contrary, we believe that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s fear of a developing Israeli nuclear power may drive
                        him to a choice between accelerating the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                        military buildup or a desperate pre-emptive attack. Either of these choices
                        would have the gravest effects on the security of Israel. We think it plain
                        that any possible deterrent value that might come from keeping Nasser in the
                        dark is trivial compared to these risks.</p>
                    <p>It is also hard to see how <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
                        could adversely exploit reassurance that Israel's nuclear activities are for
                        peaceful purposes. We certainly do not intend to provide him with details.
                        Nor did he misuse our reassurances when, with the agreement of your
                        government, we last informed him along these lines. Indeed our doing so
                        served to ease Arab-Israeli tensions.</p>
                    <p>Therefore I hope you will reconsider your decision on this matter, on which I
                        am sure you will agree that our ultimate interest—enhancement of Israel's
                        security—is the same as yours.</p>

                    <p>You should make following points orally to <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>:</p>
                    <p>1. Nasser aware past US visits to Dimona and eventually will learn of January
                        visit from other countries Israel has agreed we may take into our
                        confidence. Preferable permit us give <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> information directly to gain maximum favorable
                        results.</p>
                    <p>2. Content February 22 <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> speech
                        not new. Every Arab politician must inveigh against Israel to survive
                        politically. Realistic and moderate resolutions taken by Arab Summit
                        Conference reflect <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s position
                        more clearly than his words.</p>
                    <p>3. Al-Ahram editorialist Hassanain Haikal, confidant of <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, has publicly voiced UAR recognition
                        that war against Israel is not possible because of US support.</p>
                    <p>4. Israel's security lies in US capability and preparedness to ward off
                        aggression. Total security is not possible, however; even US lacks that.</p>

                        the President desires a thorough review of all aspects of this problem,
                        leading to a coordinated interdepartmental recommendation not later than 1
                        May 1964.</p>
                    <p>Among the aspects he wishes reviewed are: (a) likely Arab reactions and their
                        consequences; (b) various means of offsetting such reactions; (c) likely
                        Israeli reaction if we refuse to meet their request or postpone the issue;
                        (d) the likelihood that Israel could satisfy its needs elsewhere; and (e)
                        the likely course and consequence of Israeli missile development, and the
                        desirability of an effort to turn Israel aside from this course, including
                        ways and means of doing so.</p>
                    <p>The review should also assess various alternative ways of dealing with this
                        matter, such as limiting the size of any sale, postponing such a sale to a
                        more propitious time, or encouraging and perhaps helping Israel to meet its
                        needs from other suppliers. Finally, it should include an analysis of what
                        cooperative measures we might reasonably ask of Israel in return for our
                        responsiveness in meeting its arms needs.</p>

                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> to get good missiles in return (and
                        the only place to get them is from the Soviets). This has in fact been the
                        history of arms escalation in the Middle East—whenever one side draws ahead,
                        the other must needs follow. We doubt that the Soviets would give <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> nuclear warheads, but they might
                        just put Soviet missile bases in the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>.
                        Either of these outcomes would magnify the threat to Israeli security (and
                        incidentally increase the pressures on Israel to go nuclear). Finally,
                        there's the risk of <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> pre-emptive attack,
                        which our Embassy in Cairo takes most seriously. <hi rend="italic">Is it
                            worth incurring such risks for the deterrent advantage of being able to
                            lob a few conventional warheads into Cairo?</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>If the above argument makes sense, then the corollary financial argument does
                        too. Acquiring a missile capability is hellishly expensive. Why should
                        Israel waste at least a few hundred million bucks on a deterrent of marginal
                        value (without nuclear warheads), when a sum of this size could be far more
                        efficiently used in other ways?</p>
                    <pb n="77" xml:id="pg_77" facs="0109"/>
                    <p>Nor do the Israelis seem to pay much attention to our intelligence estimates,
                        the gist of which we've passed quite freely to them. In fact, <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> told Rowen we should not question
                        their intelligence, because knowing what the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> is up to is a life and death matter to them. It so happens,
                        however, that the Israelis themselves have no evidence that 900–1000 <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> missiles are in the cards. There is a sheer
                        guess, and our guess as you know is only a “few hundred” by 1969–70 with
                        probably fewer. And here is one field where we, with our own vast missile
                        experience and intensive study of the Soviets, are a lot more competent than
                        our Israeli friends. They have very little basis for evaluating program cost
                        or the immense complexity of deploying, controlling and salvoing a 1000
                        missile force. Israel makes much, for example, of the psychological
                        dislocation if several hundred missiles should land during the crucial 72
                        hours of mobilization. We flatly doubt that the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> could achieve any such highly sophisticated salvo
                        capability. We feel that the Israelis have simply closed their ears to our
                        efforts to clue them.</p>
                    <p>Bear in mind also that even the Israelis contend that the so-called <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> missile threat will not reach full bloom
                        until 1969–70. This gives us room to maneuver. What the Israelis are
                        apparently buying is the first French <gloss target="#t_SSM1">SSM</gloss>.
                        If our experience is any guide, it will be very expensive and may not be
                        terribly good. Simple prudence would suggest that Israel could afford to
                        wait a few years under any circumstances before committing itself to a major
                        program. True, <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> himself says
                        that it may be another two years before they decide how much of a capability
                        they need, but this date could apply to the beginning of deployment or to a
                        second tranche of purchases.</p>
                    <p>The simple fact that the Israelis refuse to tell us what they have in mind in
                        itself adds greatly to our suspicions. Indeed, I think you should make quite
                        a point of saying that their evasiveness over Dimona, now repeated with
                        respect to missiles, is precisely what creates uncertainty on our part.</p>
                    <p>II. <hi rend="italic">Security Assurances</hi>. Israelis are constantly,
                        though I think largely for tactical reasons, stressing the tenuous nature of
                        our security commitment. You are in a good position to say categorically,
                        from three years in the White House, that there is absolutely no doubt as to
                        US determination to prevent Israel's destruction. This has been reiterated
                        time and again, publicly and privately. The only real question at issue is
                        whether we should give a formal security guarantee. We are unwilling to do
                        so for reasons which serve Israel's interests as much as ours, i.e. such a
                        guarantee would simply trigger offsetting Arab moves toward Moscow which
                        would actually increase the threat to Israel without at the same time adding
                        an iota to our determination to act.</p>
                    <p>III. <hi rend="italic">Tanks</hi>. You are quite familiar with the tank
                        arguments—pro and con. Since you will want to avoid getting out in front on
                        this issue, <pb n="78" xml:id="pg_78" facs="0110"/>why not emphasize that
                        nothing Israel has told us suggests that the armor imbalance has become so
                        immediate and urgent a problem as to deprive us of further time for
                        reflection. The Israelis freely admit that the time when the imbalance will
                        become potentially serious is 2–3 years hence. Why, therefore, are they
                        pressing us so hard? The real answer, of course, is that it's an election
                        year.</p>
                    <p>IV. <hi rend="italic"> US Aid to Israel and the Arabs</hi>. It seems to me
                        that you have got to sustain the party line on this issue. Israel is doing
                        magnificently (10% growth rate, estimated $640 million in reserves by end of
                        this year, per capita <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss> of $900 plus). We
                        have given Israel through June 1963 approximately $1 billion in aid. True,
                        we have given the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> $880 million, but this
                        is only $32 per capita (compared to $413 per capita for Israel); much more
                        important, it has been mostly food which goes into the bellies of the
                        fellaheen not the sinews of the state. The <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> has bought Soviet arms with cotton which it couldn't sell
                        to us. Moreover, the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> bought as many arms
                        in the late 50's when we weren't giving it much aid as it has during our
                        three year PL–480 agreement.</p>
                    <p>V. Finally, I do hope that you can get across to our Israeli friends that our
                        relationship cannot be so much of a one-way street. Our underwriting of
                        their security necessarily gives us a legitimate voice in their policy. All
                        get and no give is unsatisfactory as a basis for our relationship. Any
                        objective observer looking at the Middle East of the last 16 years would see
                        US policy as being consistently pro-Israeli (aside from Suez, on which I
                        personally think we flubbed). In my opinion the Israelis know this, they do
                        count on us, and their frequent expressions of doubt are far more for
                        bargaining purposes than because of any real question in their minds.</p>
                    <p>In fact, Mike, Israel seems to have quite deliberately been seeking
                        step-by-step to develop the kind of relationship with us (overt security
                        guarantee, military aid, joint planning) which will compromise our
                        relationship with the Arabs. No doubt the Israelis think that this will be a
                        stronger deterrent to Arab pressures. But in my view it is a most
                        short-sighted policy. The Arabs already regard us as so pro-Israeli that
                        further steps will not add much. What they will do, however, is to force the
                        Arabs to react, by squeezing our base and oil interests, and by moving ever
                        closer to Moscow. This will increase the threat to Israel far more than the
                        reassurance gained from making public what we already do privately. Thus
                        Israeli policy harms rather than serves US-Israeli interests. It is no
                        disservice to Israel to have this out with them, and I hope you will help do
                        so.</p>

                    <p>4713. For the Secretary only from Talbot. In meetings Monday night and
                        yesterday in Beirut with Ambassadors <persName corresp="#p_MAH1">Meyer</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_KRB1">Knight</persName>, Hart,
                            <persName>Barnes</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Barbour</persName> I found several of them rather discouraged by what
                        they consider loss in recent weeks of gains we had made with Arabs over past
                        three years. Root cause, they agreed, is outside our control; we have now
                        begun to absorb anticipated and inevitable Arab reactions to our support of
                        Israeli diversion of Jordan waters outside Jordan Basin. They expect higher
                        pitch of anti-Israeli talk and possibly actions in months ahead, with
                        substantial fallout of anti-Americanism.</p>
                    <p>They are especially concerned that sequence of recent official US speeches
                        and actions has strongly accentuated Arab reactions. In euphoric aftermath
                        of Cairo Conference Arabs, they said, had persuaded themselves that they
                        could be masters in their own homes. Effect of Alexis Johnson and Weizmann
                        Institute speeches was to suggest to Arabs that US asserting American
                        intention of determining future pattern of area. This in Ambassadors'
                        opinion gave rise to so far unshakable Arab belief that “enlightened Kennedy
                        policies have given way to Truman-like pro-Israeli policies.” It is obvious
                        that accident of timing shortly after Cairo Conference plus superacute
                        anxieties about policies of a new President reinforced Arab reactions.</p>
                    <p>Ambassadors concurred that cumulative signals coming out of Washington now,
                        including <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> visit and talk of
                        possible arms sales to Israel, could generate runaway Arab reaction unless
                        we can find ways to balance overall impression. Knight talked seriously of
                        possible need to evacuate American dependents. Meyer felt US goodwill in
                        Lebanon undergoing great strain, with our friends under pressure to deny us.
                        Barnes thought Hussein would have to emphasize Palestine question in
                        forthcoming Washington visit in order live with fellow Arabs afterward.
                        Except for Barbour, whose concerns are different, only Hart reported that
                        his clients not particularly affected so far by anti-Americanism mood. He
                        doubted however that Saudis would resist participation in Arab programs
                        against Israel.</p>
                    <p>In earlier visit to Baghdad and Kuwait I had encountered similarly heightened
                        sensitivity to Israel question in US-Arab relations. Ambassador <pb n="80" xml:id="pg_80" facs="0112"/>Strong, who has found himself more deeply
                        entangled in Israel question since Johnson [garble] two recent <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> speeches than before, believes Iraqi
                        posture will be determined in end by way Cairo decides to play Israel
                        question and US-Arab relations. Ambassador Cottam finds Kuwaitis so anxious
                        to be “good Arabs” they adopt rather strong line on Israel and US-Israeli
                        relations.</p>
                    <p>Ambassadors of course did not need my reassurances of continuity of policy
                        and naturally they demonstrated understanding of and loyalty to US policy.
                        They questioned however whether Washington understands erosion already
                        evident in US-Arab relations or sensitivity of Arabs to campaign oratory and
                        especially to any consignment of arms this year to Israel. Understandably,
                        they pleaded for utmost restraint in US policy statements on Near East in
                        coming months.</p>
                    <p>Our Ambassadors acknowledged that Arabs had brought much on their own heads
                        by heating up Israeli issue after Cairo Conference and coupling this with
                        renewed campaign to eliminate Western bases from Eastern Mediterranean
                        region. I would describe their mood not as critical of our policy but as
                        disquieted by thought this is likely to be even more difficult year than
                        they had anticipated. I believe they were encouraged after our meeting.</p>
                    <p>If you wish we can discuss this matter further when I return home later this
                        week.</p>

                    <p>1009. <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> had substantive
                        conversations with <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> on Friday.<note n="2" xml:id="d36fn2">April 3.</note> Discussion with <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName> was largely predictable. She emphasized the growing
                        nature of the Arab threat, the recent speeches by <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, and especially the Israeli need for
                        missiles and tanks if Israel was to meet the threats. She stated that in
                        view of her understanding that the US Govt knew Israel would not be an
                        aggressor, she could not understand any reluctance to supply missiles and
                        tanks. She went on to say she was personally convinced of the friendship and
                        good faith of the United States but there were other responsible elements in
                        the Israeli Govt that felt their policy should not be predicated on this
                        understanding.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> commented that the basis of
                        Israeli policy had to be faith in the United States. He asked whether there
                        really was any alternative and she agreed that from her point of view there
                        was none. <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> then pointed out
                        that the acquisition of missiles by Israel in our view was not in the
                        political, economic or military interest of Israel. Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName> urged very strongly that missiles were
                        a needed deterrent to <pb n="82" xml:id="pg_82" facs="0114"/>
                        <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s stated aggressive aims and
                        claimed that his statements were already supported by a large number of
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> missiles, which even in their
                        primitive state could create chaos in Israel.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> commented that this was
                        probably not the view of the govt, but that of the Foreign Minister. Mrs.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName> said that she and <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> did not see things alike but that
                        they both were vitally concerned with whatever defensive needs the current
                        threats from <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> made urgent.
                            <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> raised with Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName> the unfortunate leak in the Jerusalem
                        Palestine story.<note n="3" xml:id="d36fn3">See <ref target="#d30">Document
                                30</ref>. Telegram 969 from Tel Aviv, March 23, reported that the

                            passports issued by the Consulate General in Jerusalem was in the local
                            press. (National Archives and Records Administration, <gloss target="#t_RG1">RG</gloss> 59, Central Files 1964–66, POL ISR–US)
                            Telegram 975 from Tel Aviv, March 23, reported that Barbour expressed
                            keen disappointment at this to Arad. (Ibid.)</note> Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName> came as close to an apology as he has
                        ever heard from her, although she disclaimed any responsibility.</p>
                    <p>The meeting was attended by Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName>,
                        Shimshon Arad and <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName>. It
                        adjourned and Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName> expressed the
                        wish to meet again on Monday.</p>
                    <p>Discussions with <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> later in the
                        day lasted approximately 2 hours and were attended by Kollek, Lubrani and
                        Arad, as well as <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName>. The Prime Minister had asked that
                        this be merely an informal chat. But it developed into substantive
                        discussions. The Prime Minister exhibited considerable concern about the
                        forthcoming visit to US. He pointed out that he had only been in office for
                        six months and his party would soon have to stand for election. Relationship
                        with the United States was always of prime importance. He was extremely
                        anxious that the visit have constructive results. The following items were
                        discussed during the conversation:</p>
                    <p>1. The Israeli request for missiles, tanks and naval weapons. <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> accepted the decision that neither
                        missiles nor naval weapons would be supplied, but said the need for tanks
                        was critical. He claimed they needed them fast and he was hopeful they could
                        obtain them under a grant program. <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> said a grant program was extremely unlikely and
                        pointed out the merits of maintaining a flexibility as to the source of the
                        weapons. Particularly if the tanks could be obtained at a substantial
                        reduction in price it would be in the Israeli interest to get them from some
                        other nation. (Although <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>
                        continued to come back to the United States as a source of supply, <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> is sure that if the investigation
                        which has been initiated shows that it is possible for the West Germans to
                        supply the M48A3 the Israeli Govt would be completely satisfied.)</p>
                    <pb n="83" xml:id="pg_83" facs="0115"/>
                    <p>2. Missiles. In connection with the tank discussions, <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> urged that the Israelis restrain
                        their efforts to obtain missiles from France. He said that it was his
                        understanding that they had already purchased 25 such missiles for test
                        purposes. He hoped that there would be no further acquisitions. <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> said he did not know how many they
                        had thus far agreed to buy from France. After some discussion however, he
                        agreed to consider not making any additional purchases without prior
                        consultation with the United States. He said Israel did not have the
                        resources anyhow to make any large-scale purchase at this time. In fact an
                        agreement might be possible that Israel would not buy any missiles (Feldman
                        believes he meant take delivery) in 1964 or 1965 and would limit themselves
                        to the 25 test missiles for the time being. However, in view of the threat
                        from the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> he would have to have the right
                        to keep pace with any missile program of the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. He suggested, for illustrative purposes only, that Israel
                        might purchase one missile for every two the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> acquired. This presupposed some effective method of
                        determining how many missiles the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> had.
                            <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> asked specifically whether
                        the Israeli Govt would agree to acquire no missiles if <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> would halt his missile program. The
                        reply was an unqualified yes. (When this question was asked of Mrs.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName> she did not give the same
                        answer. She felt Israel had to have missiles.)</p>
                    <p>3. The aid program. <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> recited the
                        facts and figures showing the large deficit which he stated was running at
                        the rate of $400,000,000 a year, which the Israeli economy had to overcome.
                        He said that when Italy, with a population 20 times that of Israel, ran only
                        a slightly larger deficit it created a major crisis. In view of the history
                        of United States support for Israel he hoped the aid program would continue
                        at the same level and that the rumors he had heard of a reduced level were
                        not true. Feldman did not respond directly to question. He pointed out the
                        difficulties the entire aid program was encountering in Congress and the
                        need for phasing out all over the world.</p>
                    <p>4. Desalinization program. <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>
                        exhibited considerable interest in American desalinization efforts. He asked
                        when Israel could expect the initiation of the joint program announced by
                        President Johnson. He asked also how much such a joint program would cost
                        and what proportion the U.S. Govt would contribute. <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> said that the first step would have
                        to be discussions between American and Israeli scientists. These
                        conversations would lead to a clearer picture of what is feasible and what
                        cooperative steps could be taken. However, this raised the question of
                            <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> inspection of nuclear reactors.
                            <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> said he had intended to
                        discuss this with Ernst Bergmann, whom he was seeing on Sunday. But it would
                        certainly simplify American problems if Israel would agree to <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> inspection. At this point Arad and
                        Lubrani broke in with all of the objections to inspection listed Embtel <pb n="84" xml:id="pg_84" facs="0116"/>1008.<note n="4" xml:id="d36fn4">Telegram 1008 from Tel Aviv, April 3, requested guidance for <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName>'s meeting on this subject with

                            several anticipated Israeli objections to <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> inspections and requested guidance in responding to

                        see whether there wasn't some solution to all these problems. (<persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> believes that if we can get
                        satisfactory answers we may be able to substantially reduce the area of

                    <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> asked at the conclusion of
                        the conversation whether it would be possible to prepare an agenda for his

                        suggested that it might be useful to have from him an indication of the
                        subjects he proposes to raise at those discussions. <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> promised to prepare such a list and
                        discuss them at a meeting scheduled for Monday. (Would appreciate any

                            separately.<note n="2" xml:id="d37fn2">Telegram 1022 from Tel Aviv,
                            April 7. (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_E1">E</gloss> 11–3 ISR)</note>
                        Following summary, topically rearranged in part, omits some familiar <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> argumentation employed in PriMin's
                        forcefully made presentation.</p>
                    <p>1. Tanks. <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> glad <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> officials are acknowledging Israel's need
                        to modernize its tank force. Where does Israel's request stand? <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> compared Israel's inventories of
                        various categories of conventional weapons with weapons held by <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and Near East Arab countries. Threats by
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> and others such as Ben
                        Bella must be viewed against growing weaponry gap. Israel needs 500 modern
                        tanks; “We'll start with 300.” US is only possible provider. British
                        Centurions not available in adequate number, AFG Israel wants better tanks,
                        ones to last until early 1970s. French tanks, when available, much too
                        expensive. Could Feldman give <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> some
                        consolation now on tank request, which of utmost importance?</p>
                    <p>Noting some variance between <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> figures on weapons presently in area,
                        Feldman said tanks would be appropriate subject for June meeting. He
                        stressed non-partisan nature of US special commitment to Israel's defense.
                        Israel asks that we evidence this deep commitment more. Obviously we cannot
                        have an alliance nor an inflexible defense guarantee. As last April's crises
                        showed, US is prepared intervene quickly. Other steps might be taken;
                        perhaps there could be additional contacts between our military experts.</p>
                    <p> US wishes avoid significant area arms imbalance in either direction; if
                        Israel attained clear military superiority a dangerous escalation would
                        surely ensue. <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> said we
                        recognize Israel's need for modern tanks.</p>
                    <p>After discussion of missiles (see 3 below), <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> again tried pin <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> down on tanks. <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> again acknowledged Israel's need, but said no
                        decision taken by <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> as to source of
                        supply. He asked if Israel's objective is not so much that US supply tanks,
                        as to get tanks; possibly other sources would be cheaper. <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> said he open to suggestion; maybe
                        would be better for both of us if tanks came from non-US source. However,
                        tanks from US would strengthen US commitment to Israel in Arab eyes.</p>
                    <p>2. Defense policy. <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> voiced
                        appreciation of US public assurances (and on my reminder) of private
                        Presidential assurances. But Israel's “basic philosophy” is autoemancipation
                        of surviving Jews; self-labor and self-defense. <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> says its protective umbrella covers Israel but “we must
                        stand on own feet and be able to touch the umbrella.” More bilateral
                        military consultations would be good. However, PriMin <pb n="86" xml:id="pg_86" facs="0118"/>expressed doubt that, if <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> attacked Israel and Soviets supported
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, US would necessarily intervene with
                        force on Israel's behalf.</p>
                    <p>Also, future US administrations might have different views on Near East.</p>
                    <p>I reminded PriMin that (1) absolute security does not exist, (2) even US
                        security relies significantly on our friends, (3) our commitment to Israel
                        is fundamental no matter what US political changes occur.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> said we agree we want to keep
                        balance of forces in Near East.</p>
                    <p>3. Missiles. <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> had spirited exchange as to degree
                        of threat posed by <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> missile program, and
                        Israel's reaction. PriMin said <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> would
                        have 900 missiles in three or four years. <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> replied this impossible.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>: We know US is unhappy with us
                        on missiles; cannot understand why.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName>: Missiles Israel is buying
                        from France will accelerate arms race; they are very much better than
                        anything <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> could have for
                        years.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>: <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> is first in jets including bombers, navy and tanks. How
                        does US know Egyptian missiles will not be markedly improved soon?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName>: PriMin can be sure if Israel
                        gets superior missiles, <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> will get better
                        ones.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>: Why should we always step
                        back? We will have merely “a few dozen” missiles in year or two.</p>
                    <p>I noted PriMin still talking in terms of direct equations, overlooking
                        striking power of Sixth Fleet.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>: Therefore my stress on our
                        defense philosophy. If Israel attacked, Washington's natural tendency would
                        be to take matter to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, wait few days,
                        ascertain Moscow's reaction. Meantime, many Israelis killed. “We must be
                        here to help you; we must absorb first shock.” I again observed timing of
                        Sixth Fleet's counterpunch not a crucial factor; knowledge that it would
                        come will deter <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> said US means well but fails
                        understand situation. “If I could believe you could persuade Nasser to stop
                        on his missiles or else Israel will get better missiles…But US does not
                        succeed in persuading <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>.” Look
                        at Yemen, where <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> troops gaining valuable
                        experience. <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> has employed mortars in gas
                        warfare. Is <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> certain <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> will not put gas warheads on its
                        missiles?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> reiterated <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has different appraisal <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> missile threat. Both our experts and
                        Israel's agree Egyptian missiles are now primitive. <pb n="87" xml:id="pg_87" facs="0119"/>PriMin speculated <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> building push-button weapons to
                        compensate for Israelis' man-for-man fighting superiority. He begged <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> “not to exaggerate intelligence of our
                        men.” <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> said it impossibe for
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> to become serious push-button
                        attacker for years. He warned that <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> will not be able to convince President's military
                        advisors that US appraisal of missile threat is wrong. After deliberating,
                            <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> said “then we are in bad
                        situation.”</p>
                    <p>During further <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> exchange on missiles, <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> stressed dangers of Israel's forcing
                        pace of sophisticated missilery in Near East. PriMin said it “almost
                        inhuman” to ask Israel to foreswear missiles. <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> urged that before Israel acquired missiles on large
                        scale it consult with us. <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>
                        promised consult if “we go into hundreds.” Later he said consultation might
                        be appropriate if Israeli acquisitions exceed range of “few dozens” already
                        contracted. Re number of French missiles Israel has already ordered,
                            <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> said “Maybe five more or
                        ten less than 25; about one or two or three dozen.”</p>
                    <p>PriMin made clear Israel would be glad to stop missile acquisition if <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> ceased its missile program. He asked <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> to “keep going to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>” on missile problem not to
                        concentrate wholly on dissuading Israel.<note n="3" xml:id="d37fn3">Telegram
                            1021 from Tel Aviv, April 7, reported that in a meeting with Eban later
                            on April 6, <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> emphasized the
                            danger to the Near East region if Israel were to put nuclear weapons on
                            the missiles it was acquiring, noting that the United States felt very
                            strongly about this, although he had been diverted from stressing it
                            with <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>. (Ibid.) Telegram 1033
                            from Tel Aviv, April 9, reported that in a meeting on April 7, Deputy
                            Defense Minister Peres reiterated Israeli willingness to abandon missile
                            acquisition if <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> halted his
                            program, but that <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Barbour</persName> had concluded there
                            was virtually no hope of persuading the Israelis to eschew a missile
                            program. (Ibid.)</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>4. Weapons financing. Early in our talk <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> decried US “over optimistic” analyses of Israel's
                        capability to pay much for more weapons. Sure, Israel has 700–800 million
                        dollar balance, but it owes vast sums in dollars. In 1965 foreign trade gap
                        will be $400–450 million. If <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> “denies,
                        denies, denies, we will sell everything we have to gain security”, <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> said.</p>
                    <p>Near meeting's end PriMin said he hoped talk of USAID clear-out untrue.
                        Israel must buy missiles; US can help financially on tanks. Dollar drain for
                        (French) jets enormous. 60–70 Mirages cost Israel “much more” than $100
                        million, plus spare parts and cost of training “there”. <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> reminded us that as MinFinance he had
                        opposed Hawk deal. I noted GOI nevertheless approved deal. PriMin promised
                        provide Feldman with precise figures on Israel's outstanding dollar
                        obligations for military hardware.</p>
                    <p>5. June 1 meeting. Having set guidelines for consideration of tanks, missiles
                        and desalination, <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> said
                        President may wish also discuss <pb n="88" xml:id="pg_88" facs="0120"/>Jordan waters problem. Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName>
                        said question of Maqarin Dam capacity would be worth focus.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> said in view <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> missile threat and opposition and press
                        realization thereof, when he returns from Washington he must have “something
                        to tell the people”. (Deputy PriMin <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> and others are pushing this line too.)</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> said another worthwhile topic
                        could be general <gloss target="#t_NE1">NE</gloss> area relations. (Israelis
                        did not comment on this point at this meeting, but later Assistant DirGen
                        Herzog discussed long-range <gloss target="#t_NE1">NE</gloss> policies with
                            <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName>.)</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> said Palestine refugees also
                        might be discussed, although he doubted if anyone had come up with workable
                        new idea. I commented it difficult to discuss Israel's relations with its
                        neighbors without reference to important refugee problem. <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> said only solution is resettlement;
                        Cyprus has taught <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> a lesson. Also, <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> should give more money directly to host
                        governments rather than a <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName> said she already drafting
                        direct negotiations draft res for next <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>.
                            <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> remarked she could spend
                        her time more profitably otherwise.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> several times noted <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>'s time with President will be limited
                        to about an hour, thus important to concentrate on most vital issues. Yahil
                        suggested if <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> wishes discuss refugees,
                        PriMin might do so with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>
                        rather than President.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> recommended <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> not be specific in publicly claiming
                        any accomplishments, especially re tanks, as result visit to US. PriMin
                        agreed.</p>
                    <p>As meeting broke up it was agreed our call on <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> would be described to press as for general discussion
                        his June visit.</p>

                    <p>To estimate general trends in the Arab world over the next several years.</p>
                    <p rend="center">Conclusions</p>
                    <p>A. Political turmoil in the Arab world appears likely to continue for many
                        years to come. The military have come to play an increasing role, but—except
                        in Egypt—they have not proved to be a stabilizing factor. Iraq and Syria in
                        particular are likely to remain highly unstable. The monarchies in Jordan,
                        Saudi Arabia, and Libya will come under increasing revolutionary nationalist
                        pressure, and one or more of them may be extinguished in the next several
                        years. Nasser appears likely to remain the single most influential Arab
                        leader. The noteworthy economic and social progress of the past ten years
                        will continue, although as in the past, it will be uneven and varied.
                        (Paras. 3, 5, 8–10, 16–19)</p>
                    <p>B. The emotional appeal of Arab unity will remain very strong, but in general
                        the pan-Arab movement is likely to be confined to the kind of cooperation
                        among independent countries that occurred at the Cairo summit meeting in
                        January 1964. (Paras. 20–22)</p>
                    <p>C. Arab attitudes toward Israel remain basically hostile, but a fair
                        proportion of Arabs have gradually come privately and reluctantly to accept
                        the fact that Israel will exist for many years to come. The Arab-Israeli
                        arms race will cause tensions and could lead to limited or selective hostile
                        action. Other danger points are the Jordan waters problem and the
                        possibility of Israeli military action in the event of a radical political
                        change in Jordan. Nevertheless, the general inhibitions on open warfare
                        would be strong, and a serious rise in tensions could probably be contained
                        by great power pressures. (Paras. 23–26, 29, 30)</p>
                    <pb n="90" xml:id="pg_90" facs="0122"/>
                    <p>D. Arab relations with the West remain heavily influenced by hatred of
                        “imperialism” and by Western support of Israel. The possibility of a sudden
                        deterioration of Western relations with the Arabs over Israel is always
                        present. The Arab nationalists generally will press for termination of
                        Western base rights in the area. While they will also press for a greater
                        share of oil revenues and a greater degree of participation in production,
                        nationalization appears unlikely. (Paras. 31–33, 35)</p>
                    <p>E. The Soviets probably believe that the tide is running against the West in
                        the Arab world and that they can capitalize on the unsettled political
                        situation and upon various tensions between the Arabs and West. If US-Arab
                        relations should deteriorate sharply, there would probably be a noticeable
                        strengthening of Soviet influence. We do not believe, however, that this
                        would result in one-sided reliance on the Soviets or a more accommodating
                        attitude toward local Communist parties. (Paras. 36–38)</p>

                    <p>The President and King Hussein had a private conversation before joining the
                        larger group.</p>
                    <p>The President said that he and King Hussein had discussed a variety of topics
                        including foreign aid, military aid, problems with the Congress, the $3
                        billion odd dollars spent since 1946 by the U.S. in assistance to the Arabs,
                        and the Jordan Waters problem. He had asked His Majesty to outline his views
                        and his feelings on these subjects. He had also touched on his speech at the
                        Friends of the Weizmann Institute banquet. He told the King that nothing he
                        said in any way implied discrimination. The U.S. proposal on desalinization
                        discriminated against none and favored none. The U.S. offer stood for any
                        country.</p>
                    <p>King Hussein said it was extremely important that we all speak frankly on the
                        problems which face the Near East. Realizing the great responsibilities the
                        U.S. Government carries in the Free World, he believed that there are very
                        few differences between the U.S. and the Arabs and indeed few differences in
                        what we believe in. One great difference was Palestine. He had been asked by
                        the Arab League to bring the sincerest hopes of all Arab leaders that
                        Palestine will not be permitted to become a major problem between us and
                        that relations between the U.S. and the Arab world will continue to
                        improve.</p>
                    <p>The King said the President had been kind enough to refer to his surprise at
                        Arab reaction to the President's speech. In frankness, the general reaction
                        among the Arabs was one of annoyance. This can be understood only when
                        viewed against the background of the Palestine problem. There is Arab
                        annoyance that so many sorely needed resources have to be utilized to
                        counter what the Arabs consider the major threat of Israel, a hostile state
                        which splits the Arab worlds of Asia and Africa, and complicates Arab
                        problems of development. The Palestine problem has given Jordan a large
                        refugee population, some two-thirds of its total people. Since the 1947
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolution, Israel has acquired a
                        greater area than allotted. There have been many crises such as the 1956
                        push against the Egyptians. In the case of Jordan, Israel is encroaching on
                        Jordanian territory in the south in developing its potash works. In the
                        demilitarized zones, the Israelis continue to encroach. Perhaps most
                        important at this juncture is the water problem, which boils down simply to
                        a diversion of water required in the area to another area. <pb n="92" xml:id="pg_92" facs="0124"/>Against this background the President's
                        remarks had been interpreted as a validation of Israel's right to divert
                        water and offer to provide means for even greater water resources. Those
                        would permit increased immigration and enhance Israel's threat to the
                        Arabs.</p>
                    <p>The King said that Arab policy now was one of containment of Israel.
                        Stability in the area depended on establishment of a balance between Israel
                        and the Arab states. Israel must be brought to realize that she cannot
                        continue to maintain a position in the area based on force. At the present,
                        there is no balance between the Arabs and Israel. This is what has caused
                        the Arabs to look to the Soviets for military equipment.</p>
                    <p>Israel's diversion project raised two problems: The first and most immediate
                        was the increased salinity of the lower Jordan river; the second, the
                        question of increased immigration and the threat to the Arabs of Israeli
                        expansionism. In the face of this acutely felt threat and in light of the
                        fact that Arabs cannot get their requirements for arms from the West, Soviet
                        offers are found acceptable. Arabs do not doubt the desire of the Soviet
                        Union to acquire a foothold in the Near East through provision of arms.
                        However, the Soviets have suffered serious setbacks in the area over the
                        past years and Arab solidarity will be a further guarantee against Soviet
                        penetration. Basically the Arabs seek good relations with all states, but
                        feel that Israel is “the spoiled child at Arab expense and at the expense of
                        the U.S.” What Arabs ask of the U.S. is that it look into the future and see
                        both sides of this issue.</p>
                    <p>The President said that the U.S. sees both sides quite clearly and, reverting
                        to his speech at the Friends of the Weizmann Institute banquet, said that
                        the offer on desalination was an example of U.S. evenhandedness: “We take
                        salt out of his waters and yours; we give to you both.”</p>
                    <p>Foreign Minister Atallah said that he thought the President's reference had
                        been misconstrued in the Arab world. The particular sentence which caused
                        the difficulty was that saying “Water should not be a cause of war but of
                        peace”. The Arabs interpreted this as U.S. official support of Israel's
                        right to divert water from the Jordan. Since the dawn of history water has
                        flowed through the Jordan to Galilee and on to the Dead Sea. If Israel
                        unilaterally states that it has the right to stop this historic flow and
                        divert it to alien areas when there is need in the Jordan valley for water,
                        in self defense the Arabs must take steps to secure their rights in this
                        water. If Jordan's needs for water from the Jordan were satisfied, there
                        could be no objection to Israel's diversion project. However, domestic and
                        international law both give the riparians in a basin the primary right to
                        water until their needs are satisfied. Israel's project will result in
                        stopping the flow of sweet water on which <pb n="93" xml:id="pg_93" facs="0125"/>some 30,000 Arab farmers depend. It also prevents Jordan
                        from developing lands on which refugees could be settled.</p>
                    <p>The President said that nothing he had said by implication or connotation
                        reflected anything but the U.S. desire to deal equally with all: for the
                        Arabs, for Israel, for any other country. The U.S. position on Israel's
                        project rests on the plan worked out in 1955. As for the speech, he could
                        not help what interpretations had been given to it, but he did not imply
                        that he would do for one what he would not do for others. This he wished to
                        make clear before other things were touched on. The Arabs complain about
                        what the U.S. does for Israel. The Israelis protest about what the U.S. does
                        for the Arabs and insist that more be done for them. The U.S. tries to do
                        equally for both. The President said the only language he knows is that of
                        candor. In extending $3 billion worth of assistance to the Arabs since 1946,
                        the U.S. showed its interest in their development and their future. The U.S.
                        did not spend money on people it hates. The U.S. did not extend more than
                        $40 million to Jordan last year for any reason except to strengthen the
                        country and speed its progress.</p>
                    <p>The King responded that the Jordanians were grateful, but when aid to the two
                        million Israelis was weighed against this, the equation was not balanced.
                        However, the Arabs and the U.S. had many joint interests.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said that problems of this
                        kind were laden with history. The U.S. is aware of the controversial nature
                        of most issues in the area and its relations with the area. Certain
                        principles, however, guide U.S. policies. U.S. policy starts from the point
                        that Israel is a fact. In connection with water, the U.S. made considerable
                        effort to seek a solution and the U.S. regrets that full agreement with the
                        riparian states was not obtained. There must be guiding principles to
                        formulate foreign policy: U.S. actions, we think, are consistent with these
                        principles. The U.S. would regard use of water from the Jordan system as
                        fair if within the standards set by the unified plan. The U.S. had hoped
                        that Jordan would take actions to insure its full share of water under the
                        allocations, as this was the key to full flowering of Jordan's
                        resources.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> said that His Majesty knows
                        the U.S. too is concerned over the question of salinity of the waters of the
                        Jordan and hoped that a solution to this problem could be found. Jordan's
                        East Ghor problem has contributed in large measure to this problem. He
                        believed the recent visit by our water engineer was useful. His suggestion
                        for pumping water from the power company reservoir into the canal offers a
                        short-term solution for the problem of those farmers who face the problem of
                        salinity in waters from the Jordan itself. In the longer range, there is
                        hope for progress on the Maqarin Dam. Storage there would go a long way to
                        preserve resources which are presently not usable. <pb n="94" xml:id="pg_94" facs="0126"/>The Jordan valley plan was premised on meeting equitable
                        Arab needs before any allocations to Israel were made; 6–8 years of effort
                        had been devoted to work out a reasonable solution. The continuous concern
                        of the U.S. is that the waters of the Jordan system be available to the
                        appropriate users. We hope U.S. technicians and the Arab technicians can
                        stay in touch with each other on actual and potential uses of the water.
                        This will be of benefit to all and is far more desirable than measures which
                        would serve to increase tensions.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador Juma said that the basic flaw in the U.S. approach is equating of
                        the Arab states and Israel. This flies in the face of the fact that the
                        inhabitants of Palestine are refugees, their property was destroyed, and
                        they are living in misery. In 1947 no Arab delegate would talk with the
                        Soviet representatives at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. The strong
                        ties were with the U.S. In one single decade the basic transformation in the
                        entire alignment of the Near East took place because of the U.S. policy
                        toward Israel. Arabs fear that a crisis situation can arise in their
                        relations with the U.S. unless this basic problem is faced squarely. The
                        Ambassador pointed out that the Arabs were not previously interested in
                        large armies or acquisition of modern arms except for parade purposes. He
                        fears that the trend is toward reactivation of the Palestine problem rather
                        than settlement. The Arabs are not opposed to Jews as members of a great
                        religion or as a people. However, the Zionist movement is behaving in a
                        manner which faces the Arabs with dangers. The Zionists are seeking to
                        acquire atomic weapons to further intimidate the Arabs. As a result the Arab
                        world is squandering precious resources in maintaining a balance of
                        armaments. He said he thought it was high time for a new look and a
                        reappraisal of the 1948 policy of “might vs. right”. U.S. policy now is that
                        Israel exists and must be accepted. The Ambassador believed that the U.S.
                        with its principles of justice and morality must take another look at the
                        Palestine problem.</p>
                    <p>Foreign Minister Atallah said that tension was rising because of the arms
                        problem and the expected diversion of the Jordan. Arabs know U.S. policy:
                        Israel has been created to remain there. Arabs know the U.S. anxiety for
                        Arab peace. For this latter, thanks are due. However, U.S. policy overlooks
                        the price asked; the price is tantamount to Israel's retaining Arab lands
                        illegally and no enforcement of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                        resolutions and the right of Palestinians to return to their homes. Arabs do
                        not expect the U.S. to pick up their chestnuts but do expect support on any
                        additional forms of aggression. Zionism is aggressive—it has designs on the
                        Arab world. Initially seeking only a national home, this proved not enough
                        and a Jewish state was necessary. The Jewish state quickly overran borders
                        allotted and lines emerging from the Armistice are now becoming sanctified
                        as the status quo. The Zionists took lands, <pb n="95" xml:id="pg_95" facs="0127"/>settled aliens thereon and now are bringing more. Although
                        all persecuted Jews have long been settled, Zionists seek other Jews for
                        Israel. They seek them from the U.S., the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and Britain.</p>
                    <p>(The President was called out at this juncture for an urgent telephone call.)
                        Clearly their aim is expansionism from the Zionist heartland. Arab refugees
                        have no right to their home but Jews from abroad do. Israel wants more land,
                        more water and more people. If Israel has its way with Jordan waters, Jordan
                        will become a desert while the Negev blooms. Some people say that Palestine
                        provides a military base for the West, the Foreign Minister said. However,
                        he would not go that far. He noted that the President had said that water
                        should be a cause of peace. Arabs interpreted this as saying “Let Israel
                        take your water”. There are those that say that the Arabs for four
                        generations let water waste in the Dead Sea. However, resources have not
                        been available to fully utilize this water. This, said the Foreign Minister,
                        is the mood of the Arab world. This is its spirit. Arabs respect you for
                        your efforts to achieve peace, but feel you have different standards for
                        Israelis. Mr. Atallah said that there is nothing sacrosanct in the Jordan
                        [Johnston?] Plan. Arabs have refused it since it gives Israel control of
                        Arab waters. Israel is an expansionist state and a threat to the Arabs.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> said that the foregoing
                        reflected differences in our assessments of the Palestine problem. His
                        Majesty's visit enables us to explore areas in which to seek cooperation on
                        a practical basis. It is impossible now to turn the clock back. The King
                        here interjected his agreement. We are faced with a given situation. We
                        should see how within this framework we can cooperate. Our differing
                        estimates of Israel's expansionism and capabilities must not prevent us from
                        exploring those areas where we seek cooperation.</p>
                    <p>The King said that a review of the background of current problems was useful.
                        Now we could get on with discussions of mutual interests.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> noted that we understood and
                        regretted that both sides objected to the basic elements of the Eric
                        Johnston Plan. The U.S. in its approach to the problem needed some standard
                        and the Plan provided this standard. Notwithstanding the position of others
                        we used the Plan as a yardstick on which to base our judgment of what was
                        equitable and reasonable.</p>
                    <p>The President rejoined the group and apologized for his absence. He
                        reiterated the evenhanded nature of proposals made in his February 6 speech.
                        The discussion ended and His Majesty departed for luncheon in the State
                        Department.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Summary</p>
                    <p>The important assurances by the Secretary were these:</p>
                    <p>1. US performance of undertakings incidental to military aid grant and
                        military sales hereafter will be carried out promptly and the items will be
                        in good condition, with adequate spares and appropriate ammunition.
                        Hereafter fulfillment of commitments will be of highest priority—if
                        necessary at the expense of US stocks.</p>
                    <p>2. He is prepared to talk to Jordanians (even to send representatives to
                        Jordan) about possible purchases by Jordan of US arms using funds made
                        available to Jordan-Syria-Lebanon by the new Arab group. The Secretary did
                        not promise to sell but only to talk about selling.</p>
                    <p>3. Military aid to Jordan for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 65 will be at
                        the same level as for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 64. This will be
                        managed somehow out of whatever Congress authorizes and appropriates.</p>
                    <p>(Note: The Secretary (4) did not discuss the C–47s and (5) did not discuss
                        any $5 million loan to Jordan.)</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Chronological Account</p>
                    <p>The conversation began by the King's assertion that he thought that the new
                        Arab cooperation would lead to increased stability in the area. There was
                        some discussion of economic development in Jordan—the 7-year program with
                        approximately 10% increase in the economy each year. The King used this
                        point to shift to his concern that economic development, which could make
                        Jordan independent of external aid, could be thwarted if military aid was
                        reduced. He stated that Jordan was far behind militarily.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, with respect to
                        US past performance of military aid undertakings, stated that it had come to
                        his attention that the <pb n="97" xml:id="pg_97" facs="0129"/>US had been
                        late in deliveries, had delivered equipment without spares, and had provided
                        some defective equipment and ammunition. He assured the King that this would
                        be handled more effectively in the future and asked the King to send him a
                        personal cable if our performance in the future was otherwise.</p>
                    <p>The King asked whether the Secretary was prepared to sell arms to Jordan,
                        payment coming from funds made available to Jordan from the new Arab
                        organization. The Secretary stated that he would be prepared to have his
                        people talk about this with Jordanian representatives. He added that with
                        respect to sales as well as grant, hereafter US performance would be prompt
                        and items would be in good condition, with adequate spares, and with
                        appropriate ammunition. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said that Jordan could assume that military aid
                        from the US for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 65 would be at the same
                        level as for 64—that this would be managed somehow out of whatever funds
                        Congress authorized and appropriated.</p>
                    <p>There was some discussion about the Jordanian economy (extension of
                        irrigation, drilling for oil, etc.), education and health. The King referred
                        to the Palestine problem—particularly the problem of refugees. He referred
                        to Communist influence in the Near East and called the area a “bridge”
                        between the Bloc and Africa. He stated that he saw the new Arab grouping as
                        a stabilizing regional thing and hoped to see Iran and Turkey included. He
                        mentioned that there were enticements—financial and ideological—to tie to
                        the Soviets. He stated, for example, that the Soviets offer <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>-21s at two-thirds price. He hopes that the
                        US looks at both sides of the problem and does nothing to make it difficult
                        for US's friends to continue the course they want to continue, as friends of
                        the US.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, stated that
                        fulfillment of undertakings to deliver military items will hereafter have
                        top priority, if necessary at the expense of US stocks.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> raised the question of the
                        unfortunate introduction of “sophisticated” hardware into the Near East.</p>
                    <p>The King stated that all Jordan wanted was to maintain a “balance” in the
                        area. He stated that Israel could “clobber” Jordan in 48 hours. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> stated that Israel phrases
                        the problem in almost exactly the same terms and urges increased armaments
                        for themselves on the grounds that the Arabs could destroy them. He
                        suggested that an increase of several million of arms on one side would
                        almost certainly lead to an increase of an equivalent or a greater amount on
                        the other.</p>
                    <p>Brigadier <persName corresp="#p_KGA2">Khammash</persName> stated that 15
                        million pounds a year for 10 years will be made available to
                        Jordan-Syria-Lebanon by the Arab group. The King and he stated that perhaps
                        5 million pounds of this each year would go to equipment.</p>
                    <pb n="98" xml:id="pg_98" facs="0130"/>
                    <p>The King stated that something had to be done to stop Israel—that Israel had
                        set up a potash operation in Jordan territory (“formerly Trans-Jordan”),
                        that Israel was occupying more and more of the demilitarized zones, and that
                        Israel was misbehaving with respect to the Jordan river waters. He urged the
                        United States not to do anything without considering “both sides.” Both
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> assured the King that the United
                        States was doing exactly that.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> concluded by
                        assuring the King again that <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> performance
                        of undertakings hereafter would be as he had indicated earlier.</p>

                    <p>The President opened the conversation by presenting the King a volume of
                        colored photographs taken during the King's visit, commenting with a laugh
                        that on the basis of the hospitality and good will reflected in the pictures
                        it was going to be hard for the King to demonstrate to his Arab colleagues
                        the diminishing interest of the U.S. in the Arab world, <pb n="99" xml:id="pg_99" facs="0131"/>which he was quoted in the press as having
                        mentioned in his address that noon. The King quickly denied that he had said
                        any such thing and added that he was very upset that such a story could
                        appear in the press. It was completely contrary to everything he felt.
                        Exchanges such as those he had had in Washington could do much to erase
                        doubts and establish a level of good will that would extend through future
                        relations.</p>
                    <p>The President said the truth of the matter was that the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> is interested in and concerned with the
                        future of the Arab people and would continue to be in the future. Of course
                        there would always be some people who would seek to misinterpret our
                        position but he could assure His Majesty that there had been absolutely no
                        change in policy by the present administration. We had no intention of being
                        friends of one country at the expense of another but would always strive to
                        deal with each one equally. The King said he was very pleased with the
                        exchange of views which had taken place and if at any time in the future
                        some misunderstanding should arise he would be glad to exchange personal
                        messages in order to avoid having a serious problem develop.</p>
                    <p>The President then said that it was important for the King to bear in mind
                        that the amount of help which Jordan received from sources other than the
                        U.S. would affect what we were able to do. Within the limit of the resources
                        which Congress makes available he stood ready to help Jordan. The Secretary
                        of Defense had already discussed military assistance. We were also ready to
                        help with economic assistance. He hoped the King would assure the Arab world
                        that this was our attitude. At the same time he should realize that Soviet
                        aid to the Arabs did influence the Congress and could have a bearing on the
                        level of resources made available to the Executive Branch and therefore on
                        our ability to render assistance.</p>
                    <p>The King said he was very grateful for this statement and he knew that
                        President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> would be too.
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> had asked the King to
                        convey his greetings to the President and he personally wanted to express
                        the hope that U.S.-Arab relations could in the future be close. The
                        President said that he wanted to be able to do more than at present but the
                        Congress wanted to do less. It was true that we had very heavy taxes and a
                        very large national debt. The answer to our level of aid would be some
                        agreement between the Executive and the Legislature, but the conduct and
                        actions of foreign governments could do much to influence the range of this
                        agreement.</p>
                    <p>The King said that Jordan remained deeply grateful for everything which had
                        been done and continued to do the best it could with the resources which it
                        had. For instance, various reforms had been instituted in the budget and
                        fiscal side of the government. A new 7-year development program was being
                        initiated with the object of reducing Jordan's need for external assistance.
                        The rate of taxation in Jordan was the highest in <pb n="100" xml:id="pg_100" facs="0132"/>the Arab world but even so they had just
                        proposed a bill providing for reform of the income tax. Domestic expenses
                        had been frozen for the past two years while government revenues had been
                        pushed up about 10% per year. This was Jordan's response to American
                        aid.</p>
                    <p>As for the Communist problem the King said he did not today consider this a
                        threat to the area. It had been a problem in the past but there was now a
                        relaxation of tension which had reduced the threat. Jordan had accordingly
                        established relations with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. There
                        had been times in the past, he said, when he did not know whether Jordan
                        could survive. Now he felt in a more secure position. He wanted to thank the
                        President again for his kindness in inviting him on this visit. From time to
                        time he welcomed the opportunity to tell the Arab side of the story and he
                        believed this kind of frank exchange could assure friendly relations between
                        their two states in the future.</p>
                    <p>The President said he appreciated this comment and wanted the King to assure
                        all the Arabs that Johnson is just as much their friend as Kennedy was. Our
                        desire was for peace and good will. He referred again to his Weizmann
                        Institute speech and said he had never meant to take sides. This had
                        apparently been misunderstood but the real truth is that we want to help
                        all. He would like to be able to see all the Arab leaders to make this clear
                        but since that was impossible he was glad it had worked out so that the King
                        could come and speak as a representative of all the Arabs.</p>
                    <p>The President then referred to the constant Israeli pressure for more arms
                        because of the increase in Arab arms. The King said no such increase applied
                        in the case of Jordan which was still far behind in armaments. This was very
                        worrisome to him and he hoped that some day a balance could be achieved.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> spoke up to say that
                        we had always sought to avoid an arms race. New weapons produced a demand
                        for more new weapons which led to a spiral of ever increasing armaments.
                        Ideally we should have complete disarmament but this was not possible. By
                        the same token you could probably never achieve a perfect balance for one
                        side or the other would forever be seeking more.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Nuseibeh said he wanted to make it clear that Jordan was the victim of
                        this increase in armaments. They were not increasing their armaments but
                        they remained the most vulnerable country. Foreign Minister Atalla added
                        that he had no doubt as to the sincerity of the U.S. position toward the
                        Arabs. He knew we had tried to avoid an arms race in the area. We had sought
                        to solve the refugee problem. But Jordan nevertheless remained the country
                        in the exposed position and therefore the one which needed outside
                        assistance.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> pointed out that it was this
                        very situation which had given rise to the statement made by President
                        Kennedy on last May 8. President Johnson added that the May 8 statement
                        remained the policy of the U.S. Government.</p>
                    <pb n="101" xml:id="pg_101" facs="0133"/>
                    <p>The King said the fundamental element in this picture had to be the long
                        Jordan frontier with Israel. Presumably the arms which Saudi Arabia or Iraq
                        possessed were considered part of the so-called balance but these arms would
                        do Jordan little good. Israel had the capability of hitting hard and
                        effectively and therefore Jordan felt very exposed. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said the presence of the U.S. Sixth
                        Fleet should provide a measure of security in the area. Our power was
                        Jordan's assurance of protection. Therefore we found it very hard to
                        understand <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s attack on the
                        Libyan bases. These were useful to us and therefore were a part of the
                        stability of this area of the world.</p>
                    <p>The King said that if there could be a continual exchange of views in the
                        future we could avoid this kind of misunderstanding. He had seen the
                        statement that these bases were designed to help Israel. This is part of the
                        Arab concern. He was glad to have this explanation and he would certainly
                        report these views to the other Arab leaders. The President added that the
                        matter of the bases was a real problem. If we were in effect to bring the
                        bases home why should we send military assistance out the following week to
                        help maintain stability in the area? Dr. Nuseibeh said the Arabs had a
                        genuine fear that these bases were designed to assist Israel. They had not
                        simply adopted a pro-Soviet position on the bases but were concerned about
                        them as a threat to the Arabs. The President said the bases were definitely
                        not a threat to the Arabs but were a part of the stability of the area. He
                        hoped the King would convey this message to all the Arab leaders.</p>

                    <p>To assess the implications of a US decision to provide Israel with 500 modern
                        medium tanks.</p>

                    <p rend="center">Conclusions</p>
                    <p>A. The atmosphere of US-Arab relations, which has been relatively good for
                        the past few years, has recently become clouded by a resurgence of Arab
                        suspicions that the US has a pro-Israel and anti-Arab bias. These suspicions
                        would be greatly increased in scope and intensity were the US to furnish 500
                        tanks to Israel. (Paras. 4–7)</p>
                    <p>B. Every Arab state would take at least some anti-US action, which might
                        include harassment of US diplomatic establishments and of oil companies,
                        revocation of some military transit rights, and increasingly anti-US
                        positions in international forums. Termination of US base rights at Wheelus
                        Field would be speeded up. Self-interest would, however, place some
                        restraint on Arab reactions, and widespread nationalization of oil
                        properties would be unlikely. (Paras. 8–10)</p>
                    <p>C. The receipt of tanks from the US would gratify the Israelis and would
                        strengthen their long-held hope that the US will eventually make a definite
                        decision to take Israel's side in its disputes with the Arabs. Israel's own
                        policies and attitudes towards the Arabs would not be softened, however,
                        since they are dictated by considerations of national security. (Paras.
                        15–17)</p>
                    <p>D. US ability to moderate area disputes would be seriously impaired for some
                        time, especially with respect to the Middle East arms race, which would be
                        intensified by the US action. The Soviets would be alert to exploit a
                        variety of opportunities which the US action would give them to identify
                        themselves more closely with the Arab cause. (Paras. 12–14)</p>

                    <p>Following a dinner which he had given in honor of King Hussein, Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_SAEII1">Stevenson</persName> took the King aside for
                        a private conversation. In the course of their discussion the Ambassador
                        said that in his opinion the time had come for a serious effort at finding
                        some solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict. As the King had been told, the
                        U.S. would not countenance any effort to exterminate Israel and equally we
                        could not tolerate Israeli aggression against the Arabs. If both sides could
                        accept this it should be possible to discuss possible ways and means of
                        ending the present conflict. Otherwise we appeared to be on the edge of a
                        new arms race which might have disastrous results for the whole area. There
                            <pb n="104" xml:id="pg_104" facs="0136"/>were two elements which
                        appeared to give new hope. First, in the post-Cairo atmosphere, he assumed
                        it would be possible to find a single Arab voice. Second, he gathered from
                        what the King had said that he would be willing to give a private commitment
                        of the territorial integrity of Israel. If these two suppositions were true,
                        it should be possible to undertake some private talks, without any
                        publicity, about ways and means of ending the present impasse.</p>
                    <p>After it was pointed out that territorial integrity was a difficult concept
                        because there were territorial aspects of the present controversy,
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SAEII1">Stevenson</persName> suggested that
                        what he really meant was mutual pledges of no aggressive intentions. This
                        should create the basic condition necessary for some exploratory
                        discussions. The King said that the Arab states were prepared to give such a
                        pledge of no aggressive designs on Israel provided there was no publicity.
                        He then went on to stress what he called the “inequality” of past actions
                        with respect to Israel, the basic distrust which the Arabs had of Israeli
                        intentions, plus the suspicion in many Arab quarters that the U.S. shared
                        the Israeli aggressive designs on Arab land. Under the circumstances he
                        thought that finding an amicable solution to some specific problem such as
                        the salt pans dispute would greatly assist in establishing the bona fides of
                        Israel and the U.S. Government and would thereby facilitate the steps which
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SAEII1">Stevenson</persName> had in mind.</p>
                    <p>The King then reverted to the point he had made both publicly and privately
                        over the previous few days that he hoped the U.S. could look at the
                        Arab-Israeli dispute “from both sides.” He implied that in his opinion an
                        examination of the record over the past few years would indicate that we had
                        not been impartial. The only example which he would offer was that Jordan
                        invariably faced great resistance whenever it sought financing for something
                        that competed with Israel, such as the proposed potash plant.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SAEII1">Stevenson</persName> continued with the
                        comment that the Arabs were their own worst enemies. Statements about
                        driving Israel into the sea merely built up Zionist determination to fight
                        the Arabs and their ability to raise funds. The time had come to face this
                        whole issue realistically and to work toward some solution. Otherwise we
                        faced a new arms race with no one gaining and all losing. Hussein said he
                        felt the Arab leaders were prepared to face the problem realistically.
                        Further he had left Washington with a real feeling of the President's
                        sincerity and he therefore understood what Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SAEII1">Stevenson</persName> was saying. In response to a
                        specific query, he said that Jordan did need some increase in its military
                        forces but that he had in mind only incorporating the national guard into
                        the regular army which would increase overall security and also lead to
                        better discipline and control over all Jordanian forces. He did not want
                        sophisticated weapons but just the necessary <pb n="105" xml:id="pg_105" facs="0137"/>small arms. He stressed the importance of receiving help on
                        this in order to maintain at least some Arab states with western type
                        equipment.</p>
                    <p>In concluding the conversation Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SAEII1">Stevenson</persName> commented on the relative lack of any attack on
                        the King in the American press. He said it was very important to try to keep
                        the public aspect of the trip balanced and he still hoped to see a headline
                        before the King left quoting him to the effect that peace was possible in
                        the Middle East. This would help more than anything else the King could do.
                        He knew the King had a message to get across in the Arab world but he should
                        also remember that he had a message to get across in America. The
                        representative of the Arab League who had just joined the group expressed
                        his agreement with this comment. The King said he still hoped to return some
                        day in a private capacity with his family and perhaps really get to visit
                        and understand America.</p>

                    <p>2. I would like an early opportunity to give you a brief oral summary of our
                        policy review. In view of <gloss target="#t_SP1">S/P</gloss>'s
                        responsibility for the U.A.R. National Policy Paper, I have asked Mr.

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Problem</p>

                        including active dialoguing and substantial economic assistance, or by
                        seeking to restrict <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s freedom
                        of action by, in effect, cutting off his rations. In-between measures would
                        bring all the disadvantages of the present policy without any of its
                        advantages.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Discussion</p>
                    <p>4. Most U.A.R. policies that we and our friends find troublesome relate to
                        Israel, Western bases in the Near East, or intervention in neighboring
                        countries. All three are regional perennials, and the first two, at least,
                        are widely shared by other Arabs.</p>
                    <p>5. On these and other issues the U.A.R. has the political and economic power,
                        independent of United States assistance, to jeopardize United States and
                        British interests in the region if it should determine to do so. With all
                        its weaknesses, it remains the most populous, most powerful, and most
                        influential of the Arab states, with a capability not only to move but also
                        to lead other Arab states against Western interests. Cessation of United
                        States aid would not adequately reduce this capability. (Tab D)<note n="6" xml:id="d45fn6">A copy of <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName>'s

                    </p>
                    <p>6. Constructively, benefits have been derived from our policy of recent
                        years, when we have successfully moderated pressures against our major
                        interests through our dialogue with the U.A.R. (Tab <gloss target="#t_E1">E</gloss>)</p>
                    <p>7. Advocates of the “get tough with Nasser” policy fail to realize that we
                        already appear to the U.A.R. to have embarked on this course. The relevant
                        factors include the virtual freezing of new assistance since mid-1963, the
                        Gruening-Farbstein amendments, the attendant personalized <pb n="107" xml:id="pg_107" facs="0139"/>attacks on <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> in Congress and the press, the assassination of the
                        President, and the reactions to the two Johnson speeches. In the atmosphere
                        of the Arab Summit and our support for Israel's diversion of the Jordan,
                        these developments have provoked anxiety as to constancy of United States
                        policy and an Arab public posture of truculence toward the United States and
                        the West.</p>
                    <p>8. During our effort in the mid-50's to roll <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> back by confrontation, the damage done Western
                        interests, as then perceived, was enormous. It was then that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> nationalized the Suez Canal, brought
                        in a massive Soviet military and economic presence, pressed a hard
                        anti-Western line throughout the Arab world, and accented a leftist
                        neutralism that supported Castro, Lumumba, and extremist movements
                        elsewhere. Since 1961 the balance has been substantially different.</p>
                    <p>9. The Near East is now being swept by the forces of revolutionary
                        modernization. Since the Arab peoples viscerally identify the status quo
                        with the West, the West is a natural target for their frustrations. In any
                        confrontation between the two, the Arabs have the built-in strategic
                        advantage of contesting on home ground, where Western military superiority
                        is nullified by the nuclear stalemate and the force of neutral opinion. In a
                        contest confined to political and economic action, the West could do serious
                        damage to Arab interests (Tab G), but at the same time the Arabs could do
                        unacceptable damage to Western interests (Tab F). In a struggle between the
                        Arab states and the Western powers, the Soviets would be the only
                        winners.</p>
                    <p>10. At the present juncture, a challenge to the U.A.R. will be a challenge to
                        the entire Arab world. Our vulnerabilities in the area and the capabilities
                        of U.A.R. propaganda are such as to facilitate conjunction of anti-United
                        States and anti-Israel sentiments and to consolidate the Arabs against us,
                        not only in the eastern area but also in North Africa. On the Israel issue,
                        there is no possibility of emergence of a countervailing Arab grouping.</p>
                    <p>11. We have enjoyed influence and a degree of immunity from pressures
                        throughout the region in recent years; the challenge of a policy change
                        could reduce our position in the area to the confines of a “Fortress Israel”
                        surrounded by a hostile and increasingly powerful Arab world. U.A.R.
                        pressures could be mounted against civilian overflight rights (access to
                        Africa, Middle East, South Asia), United States commerce (half a billion
                        dollars a year), United States oil interests (a billion dollars a year in
                        direct benefit to the balance of payments), United States presence
                        generally, and against any trend toward eventual accommodation between the
                        Arabs and Israel (Tab G).</p>
                    <p>12. A policy change would polarize the Near East, with the Arabs solidified
                        into an anti-Israel, anti-American bloc cooperating with the Soviets facing
                        a United States-supported Israel.</p>
                    <pb n="108" xml:id="pg_108" facs="0140"/>
                    <p>13. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> has not cast his lot with
                        the Soviet bloc, nor has he turned implacably anti-West. On the contrary,
                        there is evidence that the U.A.R. desires to straighten out the tangled
                        lines of our relations. Propaganda on the Wheelus issue has tapered off,
                        U.A.R. officials have told us that about March 27 anti-United States
                        commentary in Egyptian media was enjoined, and <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> volunteered to Robert Anderson on March 20 that the
                        single most important question in his mind is improved relations with the
                        West.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Conclusion</p>
                    <p>U.A.R. objectives include reduction of the military threat it perceives from
                        Israel, and eventual elimination of western military bases from the area
                        where the U.A.R. has paramount influence. We need to retain the Wheelus base
                        through 1970, and our policies in the Near East are premised on an eventual
                        accommodation between Israel and the U.A.R. Our assistance program provides
                        the carrot which can restrain or contain action. Without it, we will not be
                        able to maintain meaningful relations with the U.A.R. Without it, we stand
                        to promote Arab militancy toward Israel and to expose our base rights to
                        perhaps overwhelming pressure in the period of need.</p>
                    <p>Aside from this element of U.A.R. economic need and our ability to satisfy
                        it, we also have other interests in common: mutual opposition to Soviet
                        expansionism, development of commercial and economic intercourse, and the
                        strengthening of Arab independence and Arab will to resist foreign
                        encroachment.</p>
                    <p>We are not concerned merely with the U.A.R.'s capacity to do grave damage to
                        our interests in 1964. To my mind, the most compelling objection to
                        jettisoning our present policy is that it offers the best prospect for
                        building a durable position for the United States in the Near East in the
                        years to come.</p>
                    <p>To facilitate cooperation, the United States should try to avoid involvement
                        in area disputes not threatening its interests directly, accord Arab states
                        access to United States markets, financing, and cereal surpluses, and
                        provide positive support to development programs. We should seek to maintain
                        constructive exchange with the U.A.R., reaffirming our area interests and
                        our willingness to continue economic assistance provided the basic United
                        States position in the area is not challenged.</p>

                        In meeting with King Hussein April 15 Assistant AID Administrator <persName corresp="#p_MWBJ1">Macomber</persName> urged King give favorable
                        consideration Criddle proposals. Recognizing political difficulties
                        acceptance could pose, Macomber suggested King depict his move pick up
                        waters from power plant pool as unilateral assertion Jordanian rights.
                        Noting Arab Summit Jordan diversion plan may never come to fruition he
                        pointed out Criddle proposals could yield water within year—without King's
                        having declare himself against Summit plan.</p>
                    <p>King said he had taken lead in trying keep Arab leaders standing by Summit
                        decisions; acceptance Criddle proposals would mean he himself would be
                        “going off the reservation.” Macomber suggested he could portray Criddle
                        proposals as interim step to fellow Arab leaders. King wondered about US
                        financing Mukheiba dam and heightening of East Ghor canal walls. He was told
                            <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> backing for Mukheiba not possible
                        because it inconsistent with 1955 plan. Similarly we could not assist in
                        raising East Ghor walls unless this project integral part measures carry out
                        Unified Plan. Macomber assured King Maqarin dam would have strong behind the

                        financing for this project.</p>
                    <p>King conceded Criddle proposals and Unified Plan would give Jordan more water
                        than Arab plan and promised he would go back and take another hard look at
                        proposals. Said he remained skeptical about Criddle proposals and would have
                        to discuss with “other Arab leaders.”</p>

                    <p>For Amman: Believe King has keener appreciation technical advantages Criddle
                        proposals and has acquired idea of tack that might enable him to carry off
                        politically his acceptance. It clear however in King's conversation with

                        Criddle proposals wise. You should not press King on this matter after his

                        continue assure his most influential technical and political advisors are
                        fully conversant our views. You should continue give this high priority.</p>
                    <p>For Cairo: If King actually consults other Arab leaders re Criddle proposals,
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> will probably be among
                        them. In view Salim's hostility proposals and his apparent role in
                        determining King's earlier negative reaction prospects we could sweeten
                        atmosphere in Cairo seem dim. Dept officers recently have taken line with
                        Amb Kamel that Unified Plan represents only means insure Israel respects
                        Arab rights and that Summit statesmanship has shown signs of turning into
                        spite and menace. Kamel appeared taken with idea Unified Plan which
                        safeguards Arab water rights should not be thrown away. He said he would
                        report along these lines to Cairo. Does Embassy see any prospect mitigating
                        UAR hostility at least to degree assuring silent <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> acquiescence <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> acceptance
                        proposals?</p>

                    <p>The State and Defense Departments have thoroughly analyzed the questions
                        raised in <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss> 290. Their tentative
                        conclusions are that the U.S. is sympathetic to Israel's growing need for
                        modernization of its armor and would find it advantageous from a production
                        and balance of payments point of view to sell 500 tanks to Israel but: (a)
                        Israel's need is not immediate; (b) the political cost to the U.S. of
                        meeting this need directly would be too great; and (c) there are alternate
                        possibilities for meeting Israeli needs via European suppliers which offer
                        promise. The conclusion that the cost of U.S. interests in the area of
                        providing the tanks from U.S. sources would be heavy is supported by <gloss target="#t_SNIE1">SNIE</gloss> 36–2–64 of 15 April 1964.</p>
                    <p>Moreover, Israeli acquisition of surface-to-surface missiles is a matter of
                        great concern to the U.S., because of the new arms spiral it would help
                        stimulate in the area and the additional step toward an Israeli nuclear
                        deterrent it might entail.</p>
                    <p>These judgments are more fully discussed in a State Department paper (Tab
                            A)<note n="2" xml:id="d47fn2">The Department of State recommendations,

                            Meeting, April 28, 1964: Israeli Arms Requests,” were that the United
                            States should (1) encourage Israel to acquire tanks and anti-tank
                            weapons from its usual Western European suppliers, (2) explore means to
                            facilitate this, (3) dissuade Israel, “by appropriate means,” from
                            acquiring missiles or developing nuclear weapons, and (4) accelerate and
                            intensify U.S. secret efforts to achieve practical arms control in the
                            Near East. (Johnson Library, National Security File, National Security

                            (A) U.S. supply of 300 tanks to Israel as a military assistance sale on
                            liberal credit terms, (B) U.S. assistance to Israel in procuring tanks
                            from Western Europe, and (C) treatment of the tank request as a part of
                            the larger problem of controlling the arms race in the Middle East by
                            seeking Western European and Soviet agreement to prohibit the provision
                            of advanced weapons to the Middle East and seeking their support for an
                            urgent effort to obtain agreement from Middle East countries for arms
                            control measures. (Ibid.)</note>

                    <p>Therefore, the agencies concerned tentatively recommend that the following be
                        the basis for U.S. discussions with Israeli Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>:</p>
                    <p>1. The U.S. should tell Israel that, while recognizing Israel's growing need
                        for tanks, the U.S. cannot enter into direct supply at this time.<note n="4" xml:id="d47fn4">
                            <persName>Bundy</persName> wrote “Yes” in the margin next to this
                            paragraph.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>2. However, the U.S. believes that alternate sources of supply which meet
                        Israeli needs can be made available, with U.S. help behind the scenes, and
                        is willing to help Israel explore these.<note n="5" xml:id="d47fn5">&gt;<persName>Bundy</persName> wrote “Yes, plus” in the margin
                            next to this paragraph.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>3. The U.S. should tell Israel again of its strong opposition to Israeli
                        missile acquisition and seek to dissuade Israel from going down this road;
                        we are even more concerned about the development of nuclear weapons and
                        insistent that there be no proliferation of such weapons in the Middle
                        East.</p>
                    <p>4. The U.S. is intensifying its exploration of possible arms control measures
                        to damp down the Middle East arms race, and enlists Israeli help in this
                        effort.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_JJD2">John D. Jernegan</persName>. After
                        discussion of the papers presented, it was decided:</p>
                    <p>1) The United States could not afford the losses in the Arab States which
                        would be caused by its agreement to furnish the requested tanks to Israel;
                        2) nevertheless, Israel had a valid need for the tanks and failure to meet
                        it in some way would generate unacceptable pressures against the
                        Administration and in particular against the Foreign Aid Bill; 3) therefore,
                        the United States should make a strong affirmative effort to assist Israel
                        in obtaining tanks from other nations, the most promising sources being
                        Great Britain, France, and West Germany; 4) it would be highly desirable to
                        communicate the decision on this matter to the Israelis before the visit to
                        Washington of Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> on
                        June 1 and to be able to assure them that there were good prospects for
                        purchases outside the United States; 5) knowledgeable, high level
                        representatives of the Department of Defense should proceed promptly to
                        London, Paris and Bonn to explore the question with top officials of the
                        three governments; 6) since European tanks were likely to cost more and be
                        less immediately available than American tanks, the United States should be
                        prepared to offer additional economic aid to Israel to compensate for this
                        extra cost and delay; the United States should also seek other means of
                        showing its friendship and support for Israel at the time of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>'s visit—in this connection there <pb n="114" xml:id="pg_114" facs="0146"/>was discussion of the possibility
                        of proposing a cooperative project in desalination with nuclear power.</p>
                    <p>It was agreed that it was important to satisfy the Government of Israel that
                        its needs would be fully met. It was further agreed that the initial
                        investigation regarding tank availability in Europe should be kept very
                        quiet.</p>

                    <p>5141. Eyes only Cane for Ambassador. Our previous two Cane probes with
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> have accomplished little
                        more than provide a basis for continued discussion. But risks of continued
                        arms buildup in the Near East so serious that we believe it essential to
                        continue dialogue and press for some tacit agreement on both types and
                        quantities weapons before matter gets out of hand. We believe that in frank
                        discussion we should put our cards on table and make clear we think
                        missile-nuclear arms race one which <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> cannot win given Israel's financial resources,
                        technical capabilities, and general availability armaments. In any case
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> knows that US and other
                        Western Powers simply cannot allow Arabs to knock Israel any more than (as
                        proved at Suez) we intend to tolerate Israeli aggression against Arabs. We
                        should also make clear that in our approach we are not seeking to do
                        Israel's work. Our bona fides has been established in 1956 and years
                        following. Now armaments are threatening to get out of bounds with
                        increasing risk to area stability and of possible great power involvement in
                        any conflict which might inadvertently develop. Self-defeating nature
                        missile race should now be more evident to Nasser. For example, <gloss target="#t_IDF1">IDF</gloss>'s General Rabin stated April 15 that Israel
                        has appropriate answer to <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> missile threat
                        and Adzhubei implied in Paris April 8 that France supplying Israel with

                        undoubtedly got to Arabs.</p>

                        enter <gloss target="#t_SSM1">SSM</gloss> race if <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> could be persuaded exercise
                        restraint is additional new element. Israel is particularly concerned about
                        missiles just as <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> worries about
                        Israel's nuclear potential. Therefore, what we aim for are tacit, private
                        assurances from both sides re nuclear non-acquisition and missile restraint.
                        If <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> will come along, we can
                        probably get Israel agreement as well.</p>
                    <p>Accordingly, you should take early opportunity make following points to
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>:</p>
                    <p>1) You may say President Johnson much appreciated <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s recent letter,<note n="2" xml:id="d50fn2">
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s April 26 letter was
                            transmitted in telegram 2508 from Cairo, April 27. It welcomed the
                            continuation of correspondence between himself and Johnson and expressed
                            agreement on the desirability of expanding areas of cooperation and
                            seeking to reduce areas of disagreement, but it went on to review broad
                            areas on which he implied there was disagreement: imperialism, Arab
                            disunity, inequality between rich and poor nations, inequality within
                            nations, and Israel. (Ibid., POL <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>-US)</note> and will be replying. President particularly
                        noted <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s assurances about
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> opposition to nuclear weapons races.
                        President hopes will be possible to work out some practical means of dealing
                        with risks of <gloss target="#t_ME1">ME</gloss> arms race, and has requested
                        you to take matter up quietly with President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> once again.</p>
                    <p>2) <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> gravely concerned over implications
                        ever more-rapid acquisition destructive weapons by Near East states. We were
                        pleased to learn from President's talk with Talbot that UAR not now planning
                        major deployment <gloss target="#t_SSM1">SSM</gloss>'s but clearly, basic
                        problem remains. <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> missile development is
                        forcing pace leading to Israeli reaction. Nasser may now be aware from
                        Adzhubei statement in Paris that Israel apparently obtaining small number
                            <gloss target="#t_SSM1">SSM</gloss>'s from France. <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> acquired missiles first. Israel is
                        following suit. We tell Israelis <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                        missiles do not represent significant military threat but they are nervous.
                        With missiles, Israel will have added incentive seek develop nuclear
                        capability. US determinedly opposes nuclear proliferation but recognizes
                        Israel might be impelled try “go it alone” in response <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> missile build-up. However, missiles are
                        expensive and we believe Israel would forego them if convinced that <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> would show similar restraint.</p>
                    <p>3) If <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> pressure continues build up, Israel
                        has financial strength to match acquisitions. We doubt support from world
                        Jewish communities likely taper off.</p>
                    <p>4) Accordingly, we think <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> would
                        be foolish not to consider seriously some kind of tacit arrangements of
                        mutual restraint which would embarrass neither party. In fact, one could
                        argue that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> would gain more
                        than Israel. There is parallel here with variety of tacit arrangements we
                        have arrived at with Soviets. In addition to Test Ban <pb n="116" xml:id="pg_116" facs="0148"/>Treaty, we have understanding on bombs in
                        outer space and matching decisions to curtail production of fissionable
                        materials. These are not policed except through our intelligence
                        capabilities. As <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> intelligence on
                        Israel's armed forces is good, so is Israeli intelligence on <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> forces. If <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> could only assure us that he does not intend to
                        proceed further with <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> missile development
                        and will not acquire nuclear weapons (see separate message),<note n="3" xml:id="d50fn3">Telegram 5140 to Cairo, May 3, instructed <persName corresp="#p_BJS1">Badeau</persName> to note that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> had told <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> he would reconsider a statement
                            not to develop or acquire nuclear weapons, although he had difficulties
                            with the proposed draft letter that <persName corresp="#p_BJS1">Badeau</persName> had given him in October 1963, and to make clear
                            U.S. willingness to consider a new draft or some other technique. It
                            transmitted the text of an alternate draft letter from Johnson to
                                <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>. (Ibid., POL 7
                            US/McCLOY) Except for minor revisions in the first paragraph, Johnson's
                            May 20 letter to Nasser (<ref target="#d59">Document 59</ref>) is
                            identical to the draft letter.</note> we believe we could also obtain
                        quiet assurances from Israel not to deploy <gloss target="#t_SSM1">SSM</gloss>'s or develop nuclear weapons. If <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> not really intending waste lot of
                        money on missiles, we see to his advantage not to spook Israel too much.</p>
                    <p>5) So far as nuclear weapons are concerned <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> is aware we are pressing Israel to accept these
                        safeguards; we shall continue to do so. We are puzzled by <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> statements on <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> at Geneva Disarmament Conference where <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> representative objected to <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards on transfer of fissionable
                        materials or equipment as proposed by U.S. delegate March 5. We had
                        impression from <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> discussion that
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> thought it possible for
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> to accept <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards at an appropriate time. If <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> considers present <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> arrangements too complex, we would like to know.</p>
                    <p>6) <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> support for principle of <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards would help our worldwide
                        effort extend these to increasing number of peaceful use facilities of all
                        member states. Of these, Israel is clearly one of most significant where
                        agreement most needed. We also recognize major nuclear powers must accept
                        for increasing number peaceful nuclear activities same inspection they
                        recommend to other states. <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> therefore is
                        offering major US reactor for <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>
                        inspection. We hope this offer, like Tarapur in case of India, will be
                        helpful precedent.</p>
                    <p>7) In our approaches, we not seeking press Israel's case and we hope our bona
                        fides sufficiently established for Nasser to realize this is so. We are
                        aware Arab conviction Israel inherently expansionist and poses continuing
                        threat. We do not share this conviction, on basis our knowledge. We wish
                        affirm categorically that US would vigorously oppose any effort by Israel to
                        expand its borders. Similarly we would react within and without <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to threat of aggression against any area
                        state.</p>
                    <p>8) Although we especially concerned over new rivalries in missile and nuclear
                        field, we also hope to develop some means to slow down <pb n="117" xml:id="pg_117" facs="0149"/>race in conventional arms. As <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> has acquired larger quantities modern tanks
                        and aircraft, Israel has sought same. The more Nasser gets from Soviets,
                        more Israelis will have to get from French, <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, FRG and US. Time to curb arms race is running out. With
                        appreciation for <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s
                        understanding of area forces and trends, we would welcome his thoughts on
                        how spiraling of arms stockpile might be slowed.</p>
                    <p>9) We hope <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> will give these
                        points careful thought. US remains determined pursue effective Near East
                        arms limitation not because it favors either side but because, in its own
                        interest, wishes avoid being drawn into conflict into which it will almost
                        inevitably be drawn. We earnestly hope it will be possible for <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> to see merit of our contention. We
                        also hope he can make early response re foregoing ideas.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">NASSER</persName>'S POLICIES AND PROSPECTS</p>
                    <p rend="center">The Problem</p>
                    <p>This estimate is designed to assess the policies and prospects of the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>'s President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> in his own country, in the Arab world, in the
                        nonaligned camp, and in the world at large. It is aimed at providing
                        judgments about where <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> is
                        heading, what he is likely to do along the way, and how his actions are
                        likely to affect US interests.</p>
                    <p rend="center">Conclusions</p>
                    <p>A. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s fundamental objective is
                        to create a new order in the Arab world—to build a prosperous Egypt,
                        establish its independence <pb n="118" xml:id="pg_118" facs="0150"/>and
                        dignity and that of the Arab world generally, and bring about some measure
                        of Arab solidarity under his aegis. He considers that the elimination of
                        foreign influence is essential to the achievement of these goals, and he
                        regards a strong military force as basic to his own retention of power.
                        Since the influence of the Western powers is more extensive in the Near East
                        than that of the Communist states, <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s campaign against the status quo impinges more on US
                        than on Soviet interests. (Paras. 1, 3, 4, 22)</p>
                    <p>B. Nevertheless, <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s policies are
                        designed not primarily to favor or to injure the interests of the West or
                        the Bloc, but to serve those of the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>.
                        Indeed, <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> is well aware of his
                        need to remain on tolerable terms with both the US and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, since he presently relies on the former
                        for food, on the latter for arms and for aid to build the Aswan dam, and on
                        each for the political backing that keeps him from becoming unacceptably
                        dependent on the other. His basic consideration is to remain nonaligned; in
                        particular, he would not want to see Soviet military bases and special
                        political positions in the Near East replace those of the West. (Paras. 21,
                        24–26)</p>
                    <p>C. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> will continue to work for
                        the establishment of governments favorable to him and for the removal of
                        special Western political and military positions in the Near East. He will
                        support Arab nationalists (except Baathists) with propaganda and material
                        aid. A principal target in the near term will be Aden, where a dissident
                        populace offers tempting opportunities. However, <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> will exercise a good deal of caution to avoid a
                        military confrontation with the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>. (Paras.
                        12–15)</p>
                    <p>D. We foresee a continuation of <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s personal rule in Egypt and of his efforts to develop an
                        economy largely controlled or supervised by the state. He is likely to incur
                        repeated foreign exchange stringencies, but these will probably not be so
                        severe as to cause major cutbacks. (Paras. 5, 7–9)</p>
                    <p>E. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> hopes that Israel will some
                        day be eliminated as a state. He recognizes that for the foreseeable future
                        he will not have the military strength to defeat Israel. He will bitterly
                        resent any Western moves that seem to reinforce Israel's political standing
                        or military strength. (Paras. 17, 18)</p>

                            (National Archives and Records Administration, <gloss target="#t_RG1">RG</gloss> 59, Central Files 1964–66, POL 7 US/McCLOY)</note>
                        President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> received me 1930
                        hours May 7 for 45 minute interview. In light of Deptel 5168 I focused
                        discussions principally on possibilities Middle East arms race alleviation
                        along lines set forth in reference telegram.</p>
                    <p>My presentation opened with transmittal written text of Presidential letter
                        contained in Deptel 5140. After carefully reading this and requesting exact
                        meanings of certain words, President recalled this subject had been
                        discussed with John McCloy and Secretary Talbot. I reminded him that origin
                        of discussion was President Kennedy's earnest concern for practical steps in
                        the reduction of armament and containment nuclear development which would
                        further world peace. As President Johnson's letter indicated he completely
                        shares this interest and is desirous of carrying it forward. The
                        presentation I was about to make was at President Johnson's request and
                        represented his thinking.</p>
                    <p>I then put forward in slightly expanded form the views set forth in
                        Department telegram 5141, emphasizing particularly the following:</p>
                    <p>1. The accelerating pace of sophisticated weapons acquisition between the
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and Israel generated geometrically
                        progressing danger so that any step, small in itself, greatly increased
                        chances of final explosion.</p>
                    <p>2. Israeli financial and technical capability is such that they will match,
                        and perhaps overmatch, every step taken by UAR as Adzhubei statement in
                        Paris re <gloss target="#t_SSM1">SSM</gloss>'s shows. Result is not only
                        that <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> security can never be absolutely
                        established but growing financial burden will make it increasingly difficult
                        for <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> to support weapons and economic
                        progress at same time.</p>
                    <p>3. As a great power US has embarked on course of self-disciplined restraint
                        in aspects of weapon development vis-a-vis Soviets. Without formal agreement
                        or special verification procedures, Soviets have taken similar steps. While
                        admittedly these are limited they are not only a <pb n="120" xml:id="pg_120" facs="0152"/>hopeful beginning in containment of arms development but
                        indicate quiet process by which some advance can be made without formal
                        bilateral negotiations. <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> as great power
                        in Arab world should be willing to follow same path.</p>
                    <p>4. <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> deeply concerned over all nuclear
                        development and particularly over possibility of nuclear weapons in Middle
                        East. In view of this we consider it essential to peace of area as well as
                        to world interests that <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards be
                        accepted. As I had pointed out to President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> on earlier occasions, we consider this one of most
                        effective and practical steps to meet Arab fears that Israel may be
                        developing nuclear weapons. I therefore bespoke <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> support on <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>
                        safeguards, expressed concern at <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                        criticisms of these at Geneva Disarmament Conference, and invited any
                        constructive views President desired to put forward on this subject.</p>
                    <p>5. Although USA does not share Arab belief Israel inevitably expansionist, I
                        stressed our vigorous opposition to any Israeli expansionism beyond its
                        borders and our strong reaction to any aggressive threat against States in
                        area. With this as background I dwelt at some length on <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> commitment to general peace and tranquility
                        in Middle East. This is sometimes interpreted by Arabs as being a
                        pro-Israeli policy but I was sure President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> understood the falsity of this and recognized that
                        howsoever strong Arab distaste for Israel might be its continued presence is
                        a hard fact that had to be taken into account in seeking to prevent undue
                        arms acceleration with ensuing danger of conflict.</p>
                    <p>6. In conclusion I reviewed plan whereby <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                        would unilaterally and quietly give <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                        assurances that it was prepared not to go beyond its present level on either
                        number or sophistication of advanced weapons, particularly rockets. On this
                        basis chances are good that similar undertaking can be obtained from Israel
                        both as to increase and deployment of <gloss target="#t_SSM1">SSM</gloss>'s
                        and most importantly the eschewing of nuclear weapon development. A first
                        step would be President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s
                        affirmative answer to the request made in President Johnson's letter for
                        written assurance re <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> intention to
                        acquire nuclear weapons.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> listened quietly to
                        this presentation, asking several questions for clarification of English
                        technical words and details of proposal. He then requested that I send him
                        as soon as possible a written summary of the presentation I had made,<note n="4" xml:id="d52fn4">Telegram 5503 to Cairo, May 14, stated that the
                            Department wanted to review the draft of a written presentation of the
                            points made by <persName corresp="#p_BJS1">Badeau</persName> before
                            giving it to Nasser. (Ibid.) Telegram 2709 from Cairo, May 15, reported
                            that <persName corresp="#p_BJS1">Badeau</persName> sent a memorandum of
                            the conversation to Nasser on May 12. (Ibid.)</note> saying that this
                        question was of such importance that he would have to study it carefully <pb n="121" xml:id="pg_121" facs="0153"/>before giving any answers. He
                        promised to see me for a “long session” after the <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> visit.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> then said that he
                        would be replying to President Johnson's letter and that he would give
                        assurances on <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>'s purpose to refrain from
                        acquiring nuclear weapons as the President had requested. I probed to
                        discover whether this assurance was a private one for President Johnson
                        alone or would be in such a form that it could be made public, but without
                        success. The President again assured me that he would answer President
                        Johnson's request affirmatively but could not be drawn into either the exact
                        form or contents of the commitment.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: During McCloy conversations on above topic,
                        the President put forward immediately objections to the plan. That he did
                        not do so in this interview I consider somewhat hopeful; certainly a small
                        gain will have been made if <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
                        fulfills his intention to give President Johnson the assurances he seeks re
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> acquisition nuclear weapons. While
                        Nasser will certainly give me one or more long sessions on above topic and
                        other basic questions of <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>-USA
                        relationships after <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> visit,
                        I believe it unlikely these will be completed before <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> arrival in USA June 1st. In my
                        opinion it would be a mistake to press any timetable of talks that suggests
                        this exercise is governed by <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>
                        visit.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps one reason for not prolonging the discussion was that President
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> is obviously under the
                        weather. He looked grey and drawn and told me that ever since his return
                        from Yemen he had been ill and was still taking heavy doses of
                        antibiotics.</p>

                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> and any Jewish
                            leader they thought necessary that public discussion of the question of
                            tanks for Israel would be counterproductive. It would “make life tough
                            for our British friends,” <persName>Bundy</persName> commented, if it
                            looked “as if we were passing the buck to them.” He told Johnson that he
                            was with Ribicoff, who was willing “to try and keep things buttoned up”
                            if Johnson wanted. Johnson approved, saying, “I want him to stop

                    <p>I have rarely been exposed to as much pressure as I have had recently on the
                        question of tanks for Israel.</p>
                    <p>It has been only after considerable effort that members of Congress have been
                        restrained against making speeches on the question, the Anglo-Jewish press
                        has killed several articles, and responsible leaders of the Jewish community
                        have demonstrated their confidence in the Administration by keeping
                        silent.</p>
                    <p>I call this to your attention at this time because the pressure continues to
                        mount and I believe we should prepare our position as soon as possible so
                        that we may be able either to (1) take advantage of any favorable decision
                        or (2) counter any adverse decision.</p>
                    <p>I believe the various Government departments concerned are now ready with
                        their recommendations, and I am ready with mine.</p>

                        establishment of some form of body to represent all the Palestine Arabs. At
                        the Arab Summit Conference in Cairo in January 1964, Ahmad al-Shuqayri, a
                        Palestinian long prominent in Palestine Arab affairs, was designated to
                        organize a so-called “Palestine entity.” Thus far, Shuqayri has announced a
                        “National Charter for Palestine” and a “Constitution of the Palestinian
                        Liberation Organization.” These documents will be laid before a conference
                        of Palestinians scheduled to open in Jerusalem on May 28, 1964. He has
                        announced also the formation of a “Palestine Liberation Front” to be
                        composed of commando units to be kept combat ready. While Shuqayri has been
                        attempting to gain support for this Charter and for the establishment of the
                        Palestine Liberation Organization and the Palestine Liberation Front, his
                        rivals, notably Hajj Amin al-Husayni, have been organizing to oppose these
                        schemes with the support of Arab states opposed to Nasser. The current
                        endeavor to create a Palestine Entity, like previous attempts, seems
                        destined to become a victim of the continuing struggle for power among
                        Palestine Arab leaders and of the contest over the balance of power in the
                        Arab world.</p>
                    <p>[Here follows the Discussion portion of the paper, followed by copies of the
                        proposed charter and constitution.]</p>

                    <p>In view of the repeated Israeli pleas for a quick answer on their tank
                        request, I am sending you to explain our position on the matter. You should
                        explain to Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> that
                        we are giving him our firm views through you so the tank matter won't get in
                        the way of a constructive visit, to which I am looking forward eagerly. You
                        should then talk with him along the following lines:</p>
                    <p>I. <hi rend="italic">Context in Which We Considered Tank Request</hi>. We've
                        taken a most exhaustive look at the tank matter, as the Israelis well know.
                        Our <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> and intelligence community have
                        assessed the present and prospective military balance. In arriving at our
                        decision we also had to take into account whether the likely gain to Israel
                        and the US outweighed the potential costs. I want you to assure <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>, however, that we did so on the basis
                        of the underlying premise that Israel's security must be preserved.</p>
                    <p>A. In fact the US regards itself, and all the Arabs do too, as consistently
                        the staunchest supporter of Israel. It is primarily the US which is expected
                        by them to come to Israel's defense if attacked. This, of course, is simple
                        truth—since 1950 it has been a fixed tenet of our policy, reiterated by
                        every President, to deter and if necessary cope with military aggression
                        against Israel. We have also, through both public and private means, been
                        Israel's strongest financial backers. I want you to say again that I am as
                        firmly behind this policy as my predecessors.</p>
                    <p>B. But we have felt it necessary to maintain at <hi rend="italic">least an
                            appearance of balance between</hi> Israel and the Arabs, because of our
                        wide interests in the area and desire not to thrust Arabs into arms of
                        Moscow. This policy has always seemed to us as much in Israel's interest as
                        our own—not only does it give us leverage with Arabs but it helps limit Arab
                        receptivity to such obvious Soviet meddling as <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> is up to right now in Egypt.</p>
                    <pb n="125" xml:id="pg_125" facs="0157"/>
                    <p>C. One facet of this policy has been to avoid providing clearly offensive
                        weapons to Israel or to Arab states which could use them against her. Nor
                        has this policy compromised Israel's ability to maintain a substantial
                        deterrent edge. Shrewd purchases from Europe, indirectly subsidized by US
                        aid, have enabled Israel to stay well ahead of Arabs. In fact, our <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> and intelligence people all see Israel
                        retaining a substantial margin of superiority for the next several
                        years.</p>
                    <p>D. This is also the year of the Jordan Waters crisis, on which the US is
                        already carrying the main burden of backing Israel. To overload the circuit
                        by such a dramatic shift in US policy as a big tank sale, especially at the
                        very time when Moscow is bidding for Arab favor, could simply undermine our
                        relations with the Arabs. We mean here not just the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> but almost every Arab country:</p>
                    <p>1. It might jeopardize the position of Jordan, and at the least make it
                        impossible for Hussein to maintain close relations with us.</p>
                    <p>2. Since Libya has become one of the most fanatical anti-Israel states, we
                        would almost certainly lose our base.</p>
                    <p>3. Our restraining influence on issues like the Jordan diversion would be
                        thrown away just when it is needed most. Arab frustration over their
                        inability to do much about it could easily be catalyzed by a tank deal into
                        a violent reaction against us.</p>
                    <p>4. In fact, we see a major risk of Arab counteraction against our oil,
                        already likely to come under fire because of the Jordan Waters crisis.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> could end up the chief
                        gainer, not Israel.</p>
                    <p>II. <hi rend="italic">Meeting Israel's Need for Tanks</hi>. For all these
                        reasons I do not believe that the US can afford a direct sale of tanks.
                        Nonetheless we are as interested as ever in seeing Israeli deterrent
                        capabilities maintained (though our <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> and
                        intelligence people think Israel more pessimistic than it need be, and we
                        believe Israel discounts far too heavily the added deterrent created by Arab
                        belief the US will intervene).</p>
                    <p>A. On tanks specifically, we recognize that Israel's armor needs gradual
                        modernization to keep a dangerous imbalance from developing, though here too
                        our <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> see needs as more like 300 than 500
                        tanks over next 2–3 years. We also note heavy Israeli purchases of advanced
                        AT weapons.</p>
                    <p>B. We intend to see that Israel gets the tanks it needs, but without exposing
                        the US to unacceptable political risks. We believe, based on recent
                        inquiries, that it can buy enough modern tanks to meet its needs—in
                        quantities, on terms, and with delivery schedules comparable to the best we
                        could do ourselves—from the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and possibly
                        West Germany. Of course we can't speak for them; Israel will have to talk
                        directly.</p>
                    <p>C. But we promise US help in paving the way. The one absolute imperative is
                        to avoid publicity, especially surrounding the <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> visit here. If the finger is pointed at London or
                        Bonn it would be politically impossible for them to fill such a large
                        order.</p>
                    <pb n="126" xml:id="pg_126" facs="0158"/>
                    <p>D. The US could not justify grant <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> to
                        Israel in any case. Its financial position is such that it can afford to buy
                        tanks. And Centurions from the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> or M–48s
                        from Germany are probably available at similar prices to what we'd charge.
                        Nor, as you told <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> before, could
                        we justify giving tanks free while Israel uses its own foreign exchange to
                        buy missiles from France.</p>
                    <p>III. <hi rend="italic">Israeli Missiles</hi>. I want you to assure <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> that our concerns over Israeli
                        missile plans in no way influenced our decision. We also recognize we can't
                        make this decision for Israel. But I want <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> to know of my worry lest Israel get missiles on a
                        scale which would actually serve to accelerate the arms race rather than
                        damp it down.</p>
                    <p>You needn't argue this matter, but simply remind Eshkol that it is on our
                        agenda. Tell him our experts are convinced <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> can't develop enough missile capability to present much of
                        a threat. Even advanced missiles are of questionable value without nuclear
                        warheads, which are far beyond the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. So
                        we wonder why Israel should spend so much on highly expensive missiles,
                        which are wasteful without nuclear warheads and highly dangerous if the
                        Arabs conclude, as we fear they will, that Israel has nuclear plans in
                        mind.</p>
                    <p>In sum I want you to make clear that, while we can't sell Israel tanks
                        directly, we intend to see that a comparable alternative is worked out,
                        always provided the matter can be closely held. Thus we are confident that
                        Israel's security concern can be suitably met.</p>

                    <p>A negative answer from Bonn will throw a cloud on the British deal also,
                        because they wish the U.S. and/or the FRG to share the political heat.
                        Besides the Israelis least prefer the Centurion which has a range of only
                        120 miles. They want as many M–48A3s as possible.</p>
                    <p>There is the further problem that no final decision has been made by the
                        President that the U.S. will provide the retrofit kits (105mm guns and
                        diesel engines) to convert the German M–48s to M–48A3s. Mac Bundy and
                            <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Phil Talbot</persName> take the position that
                        we must be responsive on this, but the supply would be through the FRG and
                        not direct from U.S. to Israel.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendations</p>
                    <p>1. We should send the mission to Tel Aviv only if we have a reasonably
                        affirmative answer from the Germans. Otherwise a Presidential letter is
                        preferable.</p>
                    <p>2. We should agree to furnish retrofit kits for any M–48s which the FRG sells
                        to Israel, provided the Germans will act as a channel for the sale of guns
                        and engines also, and it is not a direct sale to Israel by the U.S.</p>
                    <p>3. Approve the proposed “talking paper” for the mission (Tab A).</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>When this item came up Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> distributed the draft
                        instructions from the President to <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> and Sloan for their mission to Israel.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> queried whether we
                        should say anything about possible economic aid at this time if this seemed
                        necessary to pave the way for Israeli tank purchases in Europe. <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> thought that this would really be
                        desirable because as he pointed out the Israelis probably did not want
                        secondhand tanks. Their main interest would be in the new British Chieftain.
                        However, this was terribly expensive; hence to steer the Israelis in this
                        direction, we ought to be willing to promise them some indirect help along
                        the line <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> suggested.
                            <persName>Bundy</persName> felt this would create a difficult political
                        problem. We had been telling everyone that Israel had done so well
                        economically that it was on the list of those countries which no longer
                        needed US economic aid. Could we say now that it should get more aid, and
                        still carry credibility with the Congress? <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> thought that the Congress would buy reasonable
                        continued aid to Israel more easily than to any other country. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> suggested, as a way out, that we
                        were selling many millions of dollars of equipment to the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>; we could easily knock down the price
                        sufficiently to make up the difference. If the differential between
                        secondhand M–48s or Centurions and new Chieftains was on the order of
                        $150,000, then the total add-on needed might be on the order of $30–40
                        million.</p>
                    <p>It was agreed on <persName>Bundy</persName>'s suggestion that this subject
                        should be left for the <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> visit
                        itself. However, <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> could tell
                        the Israelis that if price were a serious problem, we could consider how to
                        help meet it. <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> thought that if
                        the purpose of his mission was to get tanks off the <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> agenda, we must be able to tell the
                        Israelis more than currently seemed feasible. <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> had told him that the Israelis did not want
                        Centurions. The German deal was better, but unfortunately he couldn't tell
                        them at this point that the Germans were signed on.
                            <persName>Bundy</persName>'s view was that we couldn't really take tanks
                        off the <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> agenda. We'd have to
                        talk tanks with <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>. But we could
                        take them off the “public” agenda if we handled the matter properly.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> asked Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> if we could tell the Israelis
                        that we would provide the guns and engines for German M–48 tanks if these
                        were available from Bonn. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                        seemed to agree, and <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> pointed out
                        that this would be feasible if we could sell these items through the
                        Germans. <persName>Bundy</persName> commented that this was the best we
                        could do at the present juncture.</p>
                    <pb n="130" xml:id="pg_130" facs="0162"/>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> thought that the best he could
                        come back with under these circumstances was assurance that the Israelis
                        would keep quiet till they could explore tank prospects with the Germans and
                        the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>. <persName>Bundy</persName> agreed,
                        and felt the Israelis should start on this right now. <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> warned that the Israelis, if they
                        did not get satisfactory responses, might come back to us about tanks. Again
                            <persName>Bundy</persName> said we would [have?] to leave this to them.
                        He asked whether the President approved the instructions. The President told
                            <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> to “get the job done and
                        don't come back without it.”</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> raised a question about the
                        points on Israeli missiles in the Presidential instruction. Missiles were
                        missiles, even if the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> variety didn't
                        seem very good; <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> didn't think the
                        President should tell the Israelis they shouldn't acquire missiles when the
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> had them. He recognized the limited
                        military value of such missiles, but pointed out that they created a major
                        psychological and political problem for Israel. <persName>Bundy</persName>
                        said the difference was that the Israelis could make nuclear warheads to put
                        on their missiles, while the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> couldn't.
                        The real issue was whether Israel was going for a nuclear capability.
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> felt in that case we should
                        focus on the nuclear weapons. This was the risk. <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> agreed. He mentioned that <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> had said he would gladly settle for a 1–2 ratio
                        missiles vis-a-vis the Egyptians. <persName>Bundy</persName> pointed out
                        that the number of missiles wasn't the issue. The intelligence community
                        thought that Israel's covert program was aimed at a nuclear capability.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> concurred. The issue,
                        therefore, was one of nuclear proliferation, as <persName>Bundy</persName>
                        put it.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> suggested he use as a cover
                        story that he was going to Israel to arrange a sale of three million pounds
                        of beef under PL–480, and that he actually sign the agreement while there.
                        This would provide a perfectly legitimate cover. He had also been asked by
                        the Kennedy Library to take <gloss target="#t_BG1">BG</gloss>'s
                        recollections for the oral history. This might also provide good cover. The
                        President agreed on the beef story, but felt it inappropriate for a
                        Government official to be going to take oral history interviews. He told
                            <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> to leave this out.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Note</hi>: The meeting took place at the Prime Minister's
                        residence in Jerusalem the evening of May 17. The Prime Minister could not
                        receive us Monday morning, May 18, the regular weekly cabinet meeting having
                        been deferred until then because May 17 was an Israeli national holiday.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> outlined the points in the
                        President's instructions, reiterating a number of observations for emphasis.
                        Inter alia, he explained that the President had been thinking of replying to
                        the Prime Minister's last communication with another letter, but had decided
                        it would be preferable to send Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> and Sloan to talk with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>. The President sent warm greetings
                        and asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> to reaffirm the
                        President's firm adherence to the commitment of his predecessors to the
                        security of Israel. The Israeli request for tanks had been very thoroughly
                        considered at the highest level of the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>.
                        An important factor in these considerations was how the US could best
                        maintain and expand its influence in the Arab world. We realize there is
                        some difference of view between the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> and
                        the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> regarding US relations with the Arab
                        states. We feel it is in our mutual best interests that the US retain as
                        much influence as possible with the Arabs. The President has concluded that
                        if the US were to become a major supplier of arms to Israel, especially at
                        this time of particular stress, the situation would polarize dangerously.
                        For instance, such an act could have very negative effects on the Jordan
                        waters situation. In <pb n="132" xml:id="pg_132" facs="0164"/>this
                        connection, the President wishes to reaffirm our support for Israel's
                        utilization of Jordan Basin waters within the Unified Plan. The supply of
                        arms by the US to Israel would severely set back efforts to achieve better
                        de facto relations with Jordan generally. The Arabs would undoubtedly turn
                        to the Soviets for more military assistance. The <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has considered this matter and its ramifications in great
                        depth. We simply could not come to any conclusion other than that we could
                        not be a source of tanks for Israel.</p>
                    <p>However, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> continued, we
                        recognize Israel's need for tanks and therefore we have looked into the
                        matter much further. We sent a team, consisting of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SFK1">Sloan</persName> and another expert, to the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and Germany in order to ascertain how those
                        countries might help. Foremost in our minds were two considerations: (1)
                        Israel's need for tanks, and (2) the desirability of Israel's obtaining
                        these tanks at the best possible price.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> wryly interjected that
                        Israel would like to receive the tanks free of charge.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> recalled that when he was
                        last here the Prime Minister and he had discussed the missile problem as
                        well as tanks. He stressed there was no relationship between missiles and
                        the decision we have made about tanks. The <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> is prepared to assist in two important ways: (1) we shall
                        assist in every way we can to help Israel get the tanks it needs from the
                            <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and Germany, and (2) in this effort we
                        are willing to supply to the Germans the engines and guns for converting
                        M–48 tanks to M–48A3 models. Although we have no definite assurances either
                        from the British or Germans, we feel almost certain that the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> will supply Centurions on a fairly quick
                        delivery schedule, and that Israel probably can also obtain Chieftains from
                        the British.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> urged the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> to go to the Germans as soon as possible
                        regarding M–48s. We are talking to the Germans and will continue to do so.
                        They would have a number of problems in such a deal as we envisage. The need
                        for absolute secrecy in this whole matter is paramount, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> emphasized. It is extremely
                        important that it not appear that the British and Germans have been forced
                        by the US to supply tanks to Israel. Therefore, all discussions about the
                        possible arrangements should be held very closely.</p>
                    <p>Noting that the implementation of this plan would result in meeting Israel's
                        tank requirements, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> said
                        that we would like this present talk to serve as a substitution for Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>'s discussing tanks with
                        President Johnson. Chancellor Erhard will be visiting Washington about a
                        week after the Prime Minister leaves the US. If the German government has
                        not responded to the Israeli request for tanks before Erhard arrives in the
                        US, we will put this topic high on the agenda of our talks with him. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> stressed that the
                        projected <pb n="133" xml:id="pg_133" facs="0165"/>arrangement was the best
                        possible, and that it would result in Israel's securing tanks much more
                        cheaply than it could from the US.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister asked what would happen if the German answer were
                        negative. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> said we would
                        prefer not to speculate on that question now. He reiterated the importance
                        of secrecy. He told the Prime Minister that Israel's friends in the US are
                        being requested not to ask questions about Israel's arms requirements during
                        the forthcoming delicate period. The Prime Minister should instruct his
                        Embassy to do likewise. If this plan were to become public, its
                        implementation would be rendered impossible. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> urged that the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
                        immediately approach the British and the Germans.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> asked about financing the
                        purchase and conversion of the British and German tanks. Emphasizing that
                        his figures were necessarily only estimates, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SFK1">Sloan</persName> said M–48s converted to M–48A3s might run somewhere
                        between $120,000 and $135,000 per unit. In his discussions with the British,
                        they indicated they could refit the Centurions for approximately the same
                        figure, although they made no definite commitment on price. The British
                        appeared to be very interested in the possibility of selling Chieftains to
                        Israel, and therefore they will probably be inclined to offer to refit the
                        Centurions for a reasonable price. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SFK1">Sloan</persName> said that the Chieftains would probably sell at about
                        $300,000 per unit, about the same as the German Leopard.</p>
                    <p>Stressing that what he was about to say should in no way be taken as any kind
                        of a commitment, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> commented
                        that the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> was aware of Israel's limited
                        resources. We expect Israel to talk more with us about the problem of
                        financing its security needs. However, we cannot furnish the tanks under the
                        military assistance program, on a grant basis. When the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> has firm prices from the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and Germany, it can come to the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> for a further discussion of cost. The
                        feeling in Washington seems to be that Israel's resources are adequate to
                        cover the purchase of the 300 older tanks, but that when it comes to
                        acquiring newer models, we shall be willing to take another look.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SFK1">Sloan</persName> discussed various technical
                        aspects relating to the German part of the plan. If the Germans can be
                        persuaded to provide M–48 chassis, the cost would probably be less than that
                        which we would have to ask. We would furnish the guns and engines at our
                        lowest book price. The retrofitting would be done in Israel, where labor
                        costs are lower.</p>
                    <p>Continuing, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SFK1">Sloan</persName> said that
                        leaving aside the political questions, the picture appears to be as follows.
                        The British seem ready to deliver Centurions almost immediately and at a
                        more rapid pace than they indicated in their previous discussions with the
                        Israelis. Further, <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> probably would like to
                        sell Chieftains to Israel. It is our hope that the Germans can be persuaded
                        to make up the balance of approximately 300 with M–48s.</p>
                    <pb n="134" xml:id="pg_134" facs="0166"/>
                    <p>In response to a question by the Prime Minister, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SFK1">Sloan</persName> commented further on the cost
                        estimates on the components. In the ensuing discussion, in which Mr. Peres
                        participated, it was noted that if the Germans supplied Israel with M–48s or
                        M–48A1s, they would have to replace these with M–48A2s at greater cost. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_SFK1">Sloan</persName> noted that entirely apart
                        from the political problems involved, there simply are no M–48A3s available.
                        In reply to a question by Mr. Peres, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SFK1">Sloan</persName> said the US had discussed tanks for Israel both with
                        the Defense and the Foreign Ministry people in Germany. He too stressed that
                        perhaps the primary problem is that of keeping this whole matter secure. The
                        Germans and the British are extremely concerned about the possibility of
                        leaks.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PS9">Peres</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SFK1">Sloan</persName> discussed additional factors relating
                        to cost and delivery schedules of components. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PS9">Peres</persName> asked if Israel could not negotiate better prices on
                        the US guns. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SFK1">Sloan</persName> said these
                        prices cannot be reduced; they are our cost prices. If we were to assist
                        Israel on financing, it would have to be done in some other way than
                        changing the item prices. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PS9">Peres</persName>
                        asked about spares. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SFK1">Sloan</persName> said
                        that both we and the Germans have spares; they present no problem.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PS9">Peres</persName> noted that Germany's problem
                        would not be just a question of money. The Government would have to put it
                        before a Parliamentary committee; maintaining secrecy would be very
                        difficult. He suggested that the US give the Germans a tank for a tank at no
                        extra expense; after all, the M–48 is a dying tank. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SFK1">Sloan</persName> said this would present problems for
                        us. Preliminarily, the Germans seemed willing to exchange models even if
                        this involved extra expense for them. Meanwhile, the US will be
                        cooperative.</p>
                    <p>In response to a further question from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PS9">Peres</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SFK1">Sloan</persName> said
                        we have indicated to both the British and the Germans that Israel's
                        immediate problem is acquiring a minimum of 300 tanks over the next two or
                        three [years]. We also told them Israel has a total figure of 500 in mind.
                        Both the British and Germans, each of whom is aware that the other was
                        approached, understand that together the problem is to meet the 300
                        requirement. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PS9">Peres</persName> said the
                        provision of the conversion kits normally would take a year. Couldn't we do
                        better than that? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SFK1">Sloan</persName> thought
                        probably we could not, but we would look into it.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister observed there are many “ifs.” Moreover, as far as the
                        Chieftains are concerned, they are extremely expensive. He said he would
                        postpone consideration of the Chieftains for the later tranche of 200;
                        Israel must find cheaper tanks to make up the first 300. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> asked about the credit terms which
                        the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> might offer. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PS9">Peres</persName> said they would probably offer three
                        to five years at five and one-quarter percent. The Prime Minister asked if
                        the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> should approach the Germans; what
                        was the bridge? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SFK1">Sloan</persName> said that
                        while we are quite sure Israel will get a positive response from the
                        British, <pb n="135" xml:id="pg_135" facs="0167"/>we are not as sure about
                        the Germans. Israel should approach the Germans now. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> also urged that the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> immediately approach the Germans.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister said he would like to sum up. The <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has decided that it cannot give tanks to Israel. It is
                        suggesting that Israel go to the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and
                        Germany. He thought the US part of this arrangement should be to come up
                        with some assistance on financing. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> suggested that the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> first find out what the prices will be, then ascertain what
                        resources are available, then come to the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> and we will talk further. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SFK1">Sloan</persName> reiterated that in our judgement the provision of 300
                        units at approximately $125,000 per unit, on reasonable credit terms, is
                        something with which Israel could cope out of its regular budget.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister said it would be a mistake to assume that Israel could
                        afford such a burden. A deal involving some $60 million, even if payments
                        were stretched over ten-fifteen years, is not something Israel could easily
                        bear. Israel's deficit in foreign currency (sic) is running at $400 million;
                        next year it will be $420 or even $450 million. Israel is having to pay
                        dollars for the Mirages. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>
                        said he “confessed” that Israel would mortgage everything in order to ensure
                        its security, “but this is a very heavy burden for you to impose on us.” Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> suggested taking one step
                        at a time. The first step is to secure the British and German commitments to
                        provide tanks; the Germans will need a lot of persuasion.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PS9">Peres</persName> said the <gloss target="#t_IDF1">IDF</gloss> is not happy about Centurions. They are
                        inferior to the Soviet tanks which the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                        has. This was the reason Israel did not press the British on the Centurions.
                        The M–48s are far preferable. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PS9">Peres</persName> suggested that the US supply the conversion packages
                        at a greatly reduced cost, on a surplus basis. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SFK1">Sloan</persName> noted that this would run into
                        serious statutory difficulties.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister expressed appreciation that Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SFK1">Sloan</persName> had come to Israel. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> again emphasized the need for keeping this whole
                        matter completely confidential. The Prime Minister said, “I agree.” Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> commented that Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> has been cooperating in
                        preventing speculation; it would be a good idea if the Prime Mininster
                        requested his Embassy in Washington to continue these efforts, especially
                        while negotiations are going on. If the German Government has taken no
                        decision by the time Chancellor Erhard leaves the US, the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
                        will reconsider the situation in Washington.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> said that he would like to
                        review his instructions in order to be certain he had left nothing out. He
                        read out the section on the missile problem and the following sentence re
                        tanks: “We intend to see that a comparable alternative is worked out,
                        provided the matter is closely held.”</p>
                    <pb n="136" xml:id="pg_136" facs="0168"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PS9">Peres</persName> suggested that we closely
                        coordinate our efforts vis-a-vis the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and
                        Germany. He and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SFK1">Sloan</persName> made
                        arrangements to meet May 18th.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister said it was good to know where we stood.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PS9">Peres</persName> commented that Israel was
                        very much concerned about the <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> visit to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>.
                        Contrary to the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> estimate, Israel is
                        convinced that the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> missiles are being
                        rapidly improved. Israel is really worried about missiles with conventional
                        warheads, and has reason to fear that the Egyptians are working on chemical
                        warheads. The difference in our respective judgements about <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> missiles is very great, Peres said.
                        Furthermore, Israel would like to take up with the US the problem of its air
                        strength. It needs “a few score” planes that are heavier than the Mirage.
                        The Egyptians are building airfields further and further away from Cairo. If
                        Israel could acquire some light attack bombers, like the Douglas Skyhawks
                        and P–5's, the Israeli missile program could be “correspondingly limited.”
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> said he was not prepared
                        to react on this point.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SFK1">Sloan</persName> said he hoped it would be
                        possible for Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> to
                        give the Prime Minister a thorough briefing on our reaction time and
                        capabilities to come to Israel's assistance if it were attacked. Perhaps
                        there could be an increased exchange of information of a nature which would
                        help allay Israel's concerns. The US is confident of its ability to respond
                        to an emergency very quickly. Some quiet exchanges of pertinent information
                        might be very helpful. Israel would find it impossible adequately to face
                        all possible threats by itself.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador recalled that he and the Prime Minister had discussed this
                        subject on several occasions. He noted that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>, in a recent speech in Brussels, had
                        stressed the impossibility of any country's being completely secure on its
                        own.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister remarked that this was all very good. Israel does not
                        doubt US capabilities. What it does doubt is whether, due to world-wide
                        political responsibilities borne by the US, Israel can count on timely US
                        intervention in all contingencies. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> said that even though the US is the most poweful
                        country in the world, it feels that it cannot even sell Israel some tanks.
                        There ensued a further general exchange on this question, with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> contending that only after a country
                        becomes militarily very strong does it take up the theme of the
                        inter-dependence of security.</p>
                    <p>As another group was waiting to see the Prime Minister, the meeting broke up
                        after two hours. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> again
                        expressed gratification that Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SFK1">Sloan</persName> had
                        come to talk to him about this vital problem.</p>
                    <p>At the meeting the following day between Messrs. Peres, <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SFK1">Sloan</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName>
                        stressed again the need for restraint in any public <pb n="137" xml:id="pg_137" facs="0169"/>discussion of Israeli security needs in the
                        United States. He said it was his understanding, and he asked that Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_PS9">Peres</persName> confirm this with the Prime
                        Minister, that every effort would be made to restrain persons following the
                        Israeli security problems from discussing these problems. He referred
                        specifically to public figures who might be unaware of the delicacy of the
                        negotiations. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PS9">Peres</persName> said he was
                        sure the Israel Embassy would do its part in cautioning against any
                        discussion during the negotiations.</p>

                    <p>Dear Mr. President:</p>
                    <p>As Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BJS1">Badeau</persName> was asked to
                        convey to you last year, the United States much appreciated your personal
                        endorsement of the partial nuclear test ban and your Government's prompt
                        signature of the treaty. Your action contributed greatly toward near
                        unanimity in world support for the treaty. As you know, this step has now
                        been followed by a further effort on the part of the Soviet Union, the
                        United Kingdom, and the United States to curb the increase of nuclear
                        weapons. Thus we are embarked on an earnest effort to reduce tensions and
                        curtail the arms race.</p>
                    <p>Since assuming the Presidency, I have had an opportunity to review the
                        statements made by you and your representatives on the need for disarmament
                        and I have noted your mention of this subject to me in your letter of April
                            26.<note n="2" xml:id="d59fn2">See <ref target="#d50fn2">footnote 2,
                                Document 50</ref>.</note> I find in your statements assurance that
                        the <pb n="138" xml:id="pg_138" facs="0170"/>United Arab Republic views
                        nuclear warfare as the greatest danger to mankind and that your Government
                        regards itself as committed, in a broader sense, not to develop nuclear
                        weapons or introduce them into your defense program. Your confirmation that
                        this understanding is correct would represent a step which others might
                        follow to ensure that the threat of nuclear warfare is further
                        constrained.</p>
                    <p>The ultimate goal we all seek is that of a peaceful world and we must work
                        together in resolving these difficult problems. I know you share this hope
                        and expectation and I would welcome a further expression of your views.</p>

                        touched by the President's having done so during the sad days immediately
                        after the death of President Kennedy. He instructed the Ambassador to stress
                        his most earnest desire for good relations between the U.S. and the U.A.R.
                        and his great hopes that these would be consolidated on solid bases during
                        the President's Administration.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador began his presentation with the following three points:</p>
                    <p>1. The Near East has great strategic and economic importance to the United
                        States, ranking next to Western Europe in this respect.</p>
                    <p>2. Egypt, through the ages, has been the heart and mind of the Arab
                        world.</p>
                    <p>3. The Middle East is passing through a deep and broad transitionary period,
                        and its stresses and strains are not directly related to those of the cold
                        war.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador said that American relations with the Arab states of the Near
                        East could be divided into two periods. The first ranging from the close of
                        World War II to 1958, and the second from 1958 to the present. Prior to July
                        1958, relations with the Arabs had deteriorated because of:</p>
                    <p>1. The creation of Israel in the Arab heartland;</p>
                    <p>2. The backward-looking policies of U.S. allies, France and Great
                        Britain;</p>
                    <p>3. The “with me or against me” policies of Mr. Dulles;</p>
                    <p>4. The refusal of the United States to provide arms requested by Egypt;</p>
                    <p>5. The fact and manner of withdrawal of the High Dam offer;</p>
                    <p>6. The tripartite aggression of 1956;</p>
                    <p>7. The Eisenhower Doctrine with its premise of a power vacuum existing in the
                        Near East.</p>
                    <p>As a consequence of these factors:</p>
                    <p>1. The Soviet Union was provided an opportunity to expand its influence in
                        the area.</p>
                    <p>2. Arab confidence in the United States was reduced to a new low.</p>
                    <p>3. The United States was identified with the alien intrusion of the Zionist
                        state into the Arab World.</p>
                    <p>However, after July 1958, a creative and positive aspect emerged in American
                        policies. American policies, recognizing the forces and trends in the area
                        and adapting to them, achieved the following:</p>
                    <p>1. Not one Communist government arose in the area, despite political
                        instability and sizeable Soviet military and economic assistance. <pb n="140" xml:id="pg_140" facs="0172"/>Iraq and Syria, threatened with
                        internal Communist takeover, were purged of Communism primarily through
                        actions and influence of the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>2. Economic and cultural relations of the Arabs with the West have
                        expanded.</p>
                    <p>3. U.S.-U.A.R. cooperation in matters such as Yemen has developed.</p>
                    <p>a) There is hope of emergence of a modern intelligentsia in Yemen capable of
                        managing Yemen affairs.</p>
                    <p>b) The Royal House of Saud has been stabilized; Saudi relations with the
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> restored and improved.</p>
                    <p>c) There has been no interference with Western oil interests. (The Ambassador
                        noted that the British, following different policies, did not enjoy the
                        position in the area which might have resulted from policies similar to
                        those of the U.S.)</p>
                    <p>4. There is no broad anti-American sentiment in the area.</p>
                    <p>5. All major U.S. interests are intact.</p>
                    <p>6. The Arab-Israel conflict has been contained.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador said that this latter factor had been enhanced by the
                        understanding shown by President Kennedy of the merits of a policy of
                        “freezing the Israel issue”, avoiding public statements which might
                        exacerbate Arab sensitivities, and excluding the issue from U.S. domestic
                        politics. He warned that at the present juncture Israel and American
                        Zionists were “seeking to defreeze” the issue in order to embarrass
                        American-Arab relations.</p>
                    <p>The visit of Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> came
                        in the midst of a militant Israeli-Zionist campaign against U.S. policy. The
                            <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> recently noted that the Prime
                        Minister was coming to seek arms, money, and a security guaranty. He
                        actually, however, would seek to torpedo U.S.-Arab relations.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador said that here the President asked what he thought the U.S.
                        should do.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador said he explained that in his opinion the Cuban confrontation
                        of a year and a half ago had resulted in a detente in U.S.-Soviet relations.
                        However, behind this facade the cold war continues. He had long thought the
                        Soviets would concentrate their attack on American interests in the Near
                        East. This was proving the case. To counter this attack, the following
                        should guide U.S. actions:</p>
                    <p>1. Extreme caution in U.S. decisions involving relations with the Arab
                        states.</p>
                    <p>2. Efforts to constrain Israel to adopt policies of restraint.</p>
                    <p>3. Positive efforts to continue the momentum of improved relations with
                        Cairo.</p>
                    <pb n="141" xml:id="pg_141" facs="0173"/>
                    <p>In the latter connection, the Ambassador felt that the U.S. might take action
                        to:</p>
                    <p>1. Moderate Zionist inspired attacks against the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> in the Congress. Threats of aid withdrawal only create
                        negative reactions in the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>2. Get the British to bring about a normalization of relations with the
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_YAR1">YAR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>3. Bring the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> to the periphery of the free
                        world alliance, primarily through increasing economic ties. A Western
                        consortium to provide for UAR economic needs was essential. The U.S. must
                        encourage and support the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> desire for
                        closer economic relations with the West.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador summed up by saying evidence of U.S. desire to continue
                        economic cooperation was even more important since yesterday's announcement
                        of massive <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> credits for the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. Continued cooperation plus efforts to
                        preserve U.S.-Arab relations by freezing the Zionist question would ensure
                        continually improving U.S.-U.A.R. relations. Only the Soviets will benefit
                        if the Zionists succeed in disrupting relations between the Arabs and the
                        U.S. The Ambassador stressed that direct correspondence between the
                        President and President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> would
                        be of great significance in ensuring good relations. The U.S. should use its
                        good offices to improve U.A.R. relations with the British. The President
                        need not worry about the <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
                            communique.<note n="3" xml:id="d60fn3">The communique was issued at the
                            conclusion of Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>'s May 9–25 visit to the United Arab Republic,
                            where he took part in ceremonies marking the completion of the first
                            stage of the Aswan High Dam. Telegram 2836 from Cairo transmitted
                            highlights of the communique. (National Archives and Records

                            1964–66, POL 1 <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>-US) In an informal
                            conversation with Kamel prior to his meeting with the President,
                                <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_JJD2">Jernegan</persName> remonstrated with him about
                            the communique, noting that it had touched on almost every issue that
                            was or could be a source of U.S.-<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                            friction. (Telegram 5538 to Cairo, May 27; ibid.)</note> The facts of
                        the situation, not words, were important in foreign relations. Egypt will
                        not abandon its policy of non-alignment. It is, however, important to note
                        that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has the same goal as Israel
                        and the Zionists: disruption of U.S.-Arab relations. The interests of the
                        U.S. and the free world call for a green light from the President for the
                        Secretary of State and his aides to launch a more active and positive
                        program to improve U.S.-Arab relations.</p>
                    <p>The President thanked Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName>
                        for his expose and affirmed his interest in promoting relations between the
                        U.S. and the Arabs. He noted that some elements introduced in yesterday's
                        communique seemed completely unnecessary. These elements took some
                        explaining and could not be wished away. The paragraphs relating to
                        U.S.-Cuban relations were particularly galling.</p>
                    <pb n="142" xml:id="pg_142" facs="0174"/>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> suggested that words
                        were unimportant and Americans should try rapidly to forget any unpleasant
                        aspect of the communique. They should accept it calmly.</p>
                    <p>The President said he was quite willing to be calm about elements of the
                        communique, provided President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
                        would agree to be quiet and calm about Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>'s visit.</p>
                    <p>The President asked the Ambassador to inform President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> that the United States would firmly
                        oppose any aggression by Israel against the Arab states. The U.S. would
                        oppose Israeli expansionism. By the same token, it would oppose any
                        aggression against Israel. The President enjoined the Ambassador to inform
                        President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> that Israel does not
                        formulate American policy. At the same time, he would advise the Arabs not
                        to “corner” Israel, for only the Communists could gain by this.</p>
                    <p>The President expressed his concern at the escalation in arms. He noted that
                        the more military equipment was provided by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to the Arabs, the more France provided to Israel. This
                        spiral was both dangerous and expensive to those involved.</p>
                    <p>The President suggested that the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> not
                        concern itself too much with what Senator Gruening and others who were
                        attacking U.S. policy toward the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> were
                        saying. He noted that these same men were attacking the President and his
                        policy as well as the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. As he could not
                        stop these attacks to protect himself, neither could he stop them in the
                        interest of the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>The President noted the importance of the U.S. base in Libya to the global
                        defense posture of the U.S.</p>
                    <p>The President said that he agreed with most of the points made by Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> and would like very much to
                        see him again. He suggested that the Ambassador telephone him when he felt
                        it important to have an exchange of views.</p>
                    <p>The conversation lasted almost an hour.</p>

                        noting Arab-Israel problem only major obstacle to good relations. In recent
                        years removal of Arab-Israel question from political arena and public
                        discussions had resulted in Arab-US rapprochement. Arab states now concerned
                        that Eshkol visit represented Zionist effort rekindle quiescent Arab-Israel
                        problem, provoke Arabs and press aggressive expansionist aims. Israelis
                        expected present large list requests including arms, financial assistance,
                        and even security guarantee. Israelis had no need for arms since Arabs not
                        contemplating aggression, did not require money and had guaranty in form
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter. Zionists desired rift in

                    <p>Secretary replied stressing reciprocal US interest in good US relations with
                        Arab world, noting 1) historical tradition of cultural and economic ties, 2)
                        absence of US territory ambitions and 3) interest in emergence of Arab
                        states as strong independent entities in modern world. Differences however
                        had existed and events of 1948 and creation of Israel were among most
                        sensitive. We hoped find ways insulate such differences, otherwise
                        impossible work steadily for peace all hoped to build. We concerned about
                        peace in Near East and did not believe area should become battle field of
                        great powers. We desired assist in development friendly relations throughout
                        area. We were concerned by prospect sharply increased arms race in Near
                        East. We had worked <pb n="144" xml:id="pg_144" facs="0176"/>with patient
                        determination at Geneva to seek ways to relieve countries of overwhelming
                        burden of armaments. So far not possible make much progress. Our concern in
                        disarmament field applied as much to Near East as to rest of world.</p>
                    <p>Secretary continued representatives quite properly had not commented on
                        propriety Eshkol visit. US has relations with Israel of which visits normal
                        part. We would take all possible steps to contribute to peace in area and do
                        nothing or say nothing to inflame situation in area or harm our relations
                        with Arab world. We not responsible, however, for press speculation on
                        details visit which might not be reported accurately. We would consider
                        carefully anything we did and hoped visit would not result in any dismay in
                        Arab world or create any untoward problems.</p>

                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> expressed appreciation
                        on behalf Ambassadors, Charges and countries represented. Informal reaction
                        to Secretary's comments indicated representatives much pleased and
                        considered call successful.</p>
                    <p>Agreed representatives would inform press purpose visit and express nature
                        their concerns. Department would express US views along lines Secretary's

                        officials and express hope local news media will treat meeting in same

                    <p>Judging by previous reactions we hopeful <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> this time will have views on <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards on which have pressed him last three
                        approaches. In discussing this aspect you might wish suggest that best

                        US policy not transfer nuclear weapons into national control any state not
                        now possessing them. We would do our best obtain similar assurances from

                    <p>In connection with Israeli intentions you should call his attention to

                        rid the area completely of all arms at present in area under reciprocal

                        discuss this directly with Israel nor to enter into arrangement that would
                        be susceptible of exploitation as direct dealing with Israel. We continue
                        believe, however, there is ample scope for an arms control arrangement that
                        would avoid points <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> finds objectionable.
                        In any case, <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> statement <pb n="146" xml:id="pg_146" facs="0178"/>encourages our belief now is time

                        not let slip opportunity to prevent further worsening of situation.</p>
                    <p>You may say to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> that we have of
                        course been seeking persuade Israel, too, not to pursue nuclear and missile
                        development. If <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> continues missile
                        development, we believe this will not only lead other side to obtain or
                        develop matching or better missiles but may also lead them develop nuclear
                        capability. Therefore we urge <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
                        to think this problem through and hope he will consider carefully effects of
                        closing door to our approaches.</p>
                    <p>We strongly desire you probe <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s
                        missile intentions, perhaps citing <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                        newspaper report <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> preparing force of 1000
                        missiles by 1965–1966 as means of drawing <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> out. You should also ask him whether report <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> planning on CW warheads accurate, in light
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> use of gas in Yemen.</p>
                    <p>If <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s general attitude negative
                        and discussion proves unproductive, we would hope you nevertheless could
                        keep door open and obtain his agreement reconsider various aspects at some
                        later date. In so doing, suggest you say our concern over arms rivalry has
                        received and will continue to receive attention highest levels of <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>. We shall be exploring other means of
                        reducing threat to peace and stability caused by Arab-Israel arms rivalry.
                        Thus, <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> should not be alarmed if
                        he receives reports we have discussed <gloss target="#t_NE1">NE</gloss> arms
                        rivalry with other states concerned. Our intentions will always be aimed at
                        being helpful. We will of course discuss with <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> any avenues that appear promising.</p>
                    <p>Since this may be your last meeting with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> on this subject, request you say we hope exchange of
                        views will bear fruit both in terms of peace and security of his own country
                        and region and in terms of peace we all seek on this planet.</p>

                    <p>The <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> visit may be a strenuous
                        one. <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> is being briefed to the
                        nines on every issue which might arise. Also it is peculiar to US/Israeli
                        relations that even secondary issues often can only be settled at the top
                        level.</p>
                    <p>Even so, we're confident this exercise will be a success: (a) <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> needs to make it one even more than
                        we do; (b) we have a very forthcoming menu planned. In fact, the only big
                        risk is that we'll look so friendly as to create extra Arab problems,
                        following hard on Khrushchev's all-out pandering to the Arabs in Cairo.</p>
                    <p>1. The sheer fact that <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> is the
                        first Israeli <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> ever to visit officially
                        marks a big political plus for him. He'll portray the visit as a success
                        almost regardless of how much bacon he takes home.</p>
                    <p>2. The Israelis seem actually relieved that we're helping them find tanks
                        elsewhere (they apparently expected a flat turndown). They'll keep pressure
                        on us till another deal can be arranged (and we're still far from it), but
                        the heat won't be too intense just now.</p>
                    <p>3. We can also offer more financial aid, if tank purchases elsewhere create
                        an extra burden.</p>
                    <p>4. Most important, we can carry your February desalting offer a big step
                        further by offering a prompt go-ahead on joint feasibility studies, and a
                        promise of financial help if the studies pan out. This could easily be the
                        biggest public plus of the visit.</p>
                    <p>5. We'll also get some very good public noises in speeches and communique.
                        For example, if <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> will publicly
                        deny any expansionist ambitions (big Arab beef), perhaps we can reiterate
                        our stand against Arab aggression too.</p>

                        US since 1947. We don't intend to let Israel go under; to the contrary we
                        have from the outset done more than any other country to help build it up
                        (including over $1 billion in aid).</p>
                    <p>While we have necessarily had to maintain an element of superficial balance
                        in our public posture, and have at times disagreed with Israeli policy, the
                        record of our support is crystal clear. This has cost us much with the
                        Arabs, and given the Soviets a big opening to exploit, but we don't intend
                        to swerve from this policy.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">The one thing we ask of Israel</hi> is not to keep trying
                        to force us to an all-out pro-Israeli policy. We ask this not just because a
                        balanced policy is essential strategically to keep the Soviets out of the
                            <gloss target="#t_ME1">ME</gloss>, and economically because of oil but
                        because it is as much in Israel's interest as ours. If we choose Israel's
                        side so openly that the Arabs form alliances with Moscow, Israel loses just
                        as much as we. Our present policy gives the Arabs an incentive not to swing
                        too far away from the West. This is simple common sense.</p>
                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Our Jordan Waters stand</hi> is just the latest example
                        of our support. We designed the Johnston Plan and stand fully by it, as the
                        Arabs know.</p>
                    <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Desalting</hi>. We recognize how vital water is to
                        Israel's future, and since readily available sources are about exhausted you
                        have personally inaugurated a new joint enterprise to exploit desalting—the
                        only great new hope for water. We will be as forthcoming here as the still
                        uncertain state of the art will allow. We'll work jointly with Israel to
                        survey what kind of nuclear desalting plant would be technically and
                        economically best, and would be prepared to help finance a plant if and when
                        a mutually satisfactory scheme can be worked out (this could cost us as much
                        as a $100 million loan).</p>
                    <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Israel's own deterrent posture</hi>. We've always kept a
                        close eye on the Arab-Israeli military balance. Our <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> and intelligence people just reviewed it again, and see
                        Israel as able to maintain quite a deterrent edge for the foreseeable
                            future.<note n="3" xml:id="d63fn3">A June 1 memorandum from
                                <persName>Bundy</persName> to Johnson suggested that he might want
                            to have a brief private talk with <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> [text not declassified]. He noted that the United
                            States and Israel had differing estimates of the strength of the Arab
                            states and that it was in the U.S. interest to show the Israelis that
                            U.S. information was more reliable. (Johnson Library, National Security
                            File, Memos to the President, <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">McGeorge

                        regarded our economic aid as permitting Israel to buy enough modern arms in
                        Europe to compensate for our inability to provide them directly. Even so,
                        when nothing else was available we came through on Hawks.</p>
                    <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Tanks</hi>. We appreciate <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>'s understanding as to why we simply can't afford to
                        sell Israel tanks directly. But we'll do everything we can to help get them
                        elsewhere. <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> will probably say
                        he's grateful for our proffered help, but is dubious over whether Israel can
                        get what it needs elsewhere. He will probably <hi rend="italic">make a
                            strong pitch that only M–48A3s from Germany</hi> will do. Since a German
                        deal (even through another intermediary) looks questionable so far, we must
                        insist that the Israelis consider the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                        Centurion, which is available. It hasn't got the range of our M–48A3, but is
                        otherwise just as good, and our military say it's adequate to meet Israel's
                        defensive needs. My instinct is that Israel will make every effort to get
                        M–48's, but fall back on the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> if this
                        fails. So we ought to make every effort to help them with the Germans, but
                        not let them come back to us if this aborts.</p>
                    <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Other arms requests</hi>. <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> may, in the course of describing Israeli security
                        worries, mention other arms needs, such as the jet bombers he mentioned to
                            <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName>, or some counter to the
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>'s Soviet-supplied missile boats. Our
                        response is that our <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> and intelligence
                        people see Israel as still able to maintain quite a deterrent edge. Nor
                        should the Israelis forget our own deterrent support.</p>
                    <p>7. <hi rend="italic">The <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> Missile Threat
                            and Israel's Own Missile Plans</hi>. We've been over this ground many
                        times unsuccessfully, but <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> put
                            <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> on notice that you'd have a
                        personal try. Attached (Tab A)<note n="4" xml:id="d63fn4">Not found.</note>
                        is a Defense study which counters the latest Israeli allegations (now it's
                        chemical warheads). Perhaps the best argument with <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> is that his military (like our own so
                        often) may have sold him on a very expensive and dangerous counter to a
                        threat they hadn't really evaluated. We probably can't get Israel to cancel
                        its existing French contract (which may be only for R and D missiles, though
                        we just don't know). We can't veto Israel's missile plans, but as Israel's
                        security guarantors we're entitled to ask it not to buy operational missiles
                        until after it has consulted us.</p>
                    <p>8. <hi rend="italic">Dimona Reactor</hi>. We appreciate Israel's commitment
                        to regular inspection but are disturbed at <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>'s refusal to let us reassure the Arabs in general
                        terms (you sent <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> two messages on
                        this). We're firmly convinced that Israel's apparent desire to keep the
                        Arabs <pb n="150" xml:id="pg_150" facs="0182"/>guessing is highly dangerous.
                        To appear to be going nuclear without really doing so is to invite trouble.
                        It might spark Nasser into a foolish pre-emptive move. Without in any way
                        implying that Israel is going nuclear, one has to admit that a functioning
                        secret breeder reactor plus an oncoming missile delivery system add up to an
                        inescapable conclusion that Israel is at least putting itself in a position
                        to go nuclear. This could have the gravest repercussions on US-Israeli
                        relations, and the earlier we try to halt it the better chance we have. This
                        is why your raising a to-do about missiles, even if unsuccessful, will at
                        least put Israel firmly on notice that we may be back at it again.</p>
                    <p>9. <hi rend="italic">IAEA Controls</hi>. Israel's reluctance to accept <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> controls also adds to our suspicions. We
                        can't make Israel an exception because we're making sixty or so other
                        clients of ours toe the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> line. The
                        immediate issue is over renewal of a piddling 1–MW research reactor, but any
                        new reactor on which we help Israel would have to be under <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>. We hope you'll personally tell <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> they should bite the bullet now.</p>
                    <p>10. <hi rend="italic">Economic Aid</hi>. Israel's economy is doing so well
                        that Dave Bell sees no economic justification for new AID loans. Israel has
                        had a fantastic 9–10% growth rate, has over $600 million reserves, per
                        capita income of over $1,000 (better than Italy), etc. While <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> worries over Israel's great foreign
                        debt, fact is that Israel bonds are being paid off mostly in Israeli pounds
                        for tourism et al. However, <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> is
                        determined to show that Israel still needs help, and there may be a
                        political requirement here. Bell hopes we can keep trend downward from $20
                        million <gloss target="#t_DL1">DL</gloss> this year, but could live with $10
                        million per annum in 1965 (our presentation was $0–10) and 1966. But we
                        would want to make clear that this is help in financing indirectly Israel's
                        arms purchases, i.e. an additional incentive for them to go to European
                        suppliers.</p>
                    <p>11. <hi rend="italic">Our Arab Policy</hi>. No one can blame the Israelis,
                        surrounded as they are, for repeatedly sniping at our Arab policy. The top
                        people want to believe that we know what we're doing (and many Israelis
                        agree with our policy), but they've been conditioned by living under the gun
                        for so long to a “fortress Israel” psychology which leads them to
                        over-react. In turn, the constant Arab verbal attacks are in reality a
                        reflection of Arab frustration at their own impotence.</p>
                    <p>We want to avoid at all costs a situation in which we become lined up so
                        overtly behind Israel that the Arabs choose the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> as their champion. It is Soviet arms, not US wheat, which
                        creates the real threat to Israel. The greater the Soviet presence in the
                        Middle East, the greater the threat to Israel. If you will only drive home
                        these facts of life politely but firmly to <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>, it will help mightily in toning down the kind <pb n="151" xml:id="pg_151" facs="0183"/>of repeated pressure from Israel
                        and its friends which poses such a dilemma for us in the Middle East.</p>

                        program in pushing arms rivalry to new and dangerous levels, as covered in

                        impression Israel about to go nuclear with our understanding and tacit
                        support. We therefore leave to you best means of convincing <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> this is game he cannot win because
                        of Israel's technological development and access to outside financial
                        sources.</p>
                    <p>Moreover, we think it important he be made to realize, in way he will not
                        resent, fact that he must shoulder large share responsibility for arms race
                        in general. His periodic opening of “icebox” door (cite cases) has let out
                        blasts of cold air that put great psychological pressure on Israelis to
                        obtain deterrent. We are not trying to justify Israeli actions to him; we
                        are merely explaining them and his responsibility.</p>
                    <p>Essential facts are:</p>
                    <p>(1) <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> was first to opt for surface to
                        surface missile force.</p>
                    <p>(2) <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> is continuing to develop <gloss target="#t_SSM1">SSM</gloss>s.</p>
                    <p>(3) Reports are that Israel in response is also acquiring <gloss target="#t_SSM1">SSM</gloss>s.</p>
                    <p>(4) Once possessed of <gloss target="#t_SSM1">SSM</gloss>s and confronted
                        with a growing <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> missile force, Israel
                        might well seek to develop more lethal warheads to provide deterrence
                        against implacable Arab hostility it senses from Arab public statements.</p>
                    <pb n="152" xml:id="pg_152" facs="0184"/>
                    <p>(5) We believe Israel can be persuaded not to proceed further with <gloss target="#t_SSM1">SSM</gloss> development if <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> willing to demonstrate restraint.</p>
                    <p>(6) Otherwise, we fear race will inexorably escalate.</p>
                    <p>(7) But no good purpose served by such escalation. Situation is obviously
                        self-defeating for both sides. Not only does it make for greater danger of
                        war, it also diverts resources badly needed in development of more
                        prosperous Arab nation. Moreover, US determined forestall aggression by
                        either side, and has capability do so. So we wonder why either side should
                        engage in wasteful expensive programs, which will not achieve any decisive
                        military result.</p>

                    <p>The President began by saying to the Prime Minister that the United States
                        was and would continue to be interested in the security</p>
                    <pb n="153" xml:id="pg_153" facs="0185"/>
                    <p>The President said that he appreciated very much the way Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> had been received by the Prime
                        Minister. The President said that as long as he remained in the White House,
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> would continue to serve as
                        his “Prime Minister” on the question of Israel.</p>
                    <p>The President went on to say that he was foursquare behind Israel on all
                        matters that affected their vital security interests. Just as the U.S. was
                        in Southeast Asia, they would be wherever they were needed.</p>
                    <p>The President took up the specific problems on the agenda. With regard to
                        tanks, he said he appreciated the readiness of Israel to agree to the manner
                        in which tanks could be provided. He pointed out that we could not provide
                        tanks directly but we would be glad to help Israel in every way possible to
                        get a sufficient quantity of tanks elsewhere. “We believe the Centurion is a
                        good tank” he said, “and it will certainly be available. However, we will
                        also do everything we can to help in the M–48.”</p>
                    <p>The President then referred to the fact that Senator Ribicoff had discussed
                        this matter with him and also that he appreciated the fact that the tank
                        matter had not been made a public issue but had been kept discreet.</p>
                    <p>On the question of water, the President pointed out that all the Arab
                        capitals have been informed that the United States supports the Johnston
                        Plan. There can be no doubt in anyone's mind concerning U.S. commitment to
                        this water project. The President said “We back Israel fully on the Jordan
                        water. We want Israel to have more water. For that reason we are ready to
                        undertake a study in connection with the desalting program which will also
                        provide Israel with the water it needs. If the study proves that the
                        desalting project is feasible, we will help in working it out. We will help
                        Israel on this as much as possible. We have told the Arab Governments about
                        this. Of course, we will get some backlash from the Arab countries as a
                        result of your visit with me. However, I am not worried by that. It is
                        important both to you and to the United States that everybody should know
                        that we are friends. So that is no reason for us not to go forward with this
                        desalting project.”</p>
                    <p>The President asked Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> to make clear to his people that “if we turned our
                        backs on the Arabs it would hurt Israel. We are deeply concerned with
                        Israel's security. Our Joint Chiefs of Staff keep a close watch on this. And
                        we are more confident of the Israeli deterrent edge than the Israelis seem
                        to be. We don't blame them for running scared, but we hope they will listen
                        to well meant advice.</p>
                    <p>“Of course, we know that the Israeli Government is worried over the U.A.R.
                        missile threat. But that threat is likely to remain feeble through 1970.
                        Israel should not hasten to counter it and accelerate an <pb n="154" xml:id="pg_154" facs="0186"/>arms race. It can always count on the
                        United States in an emergency.” The President pointed out that the Arabs
                        will inevitably tie Israeli missiles to Israel's nuclear potential. He said
                        that he should like to remind the Prime Minister that the U.S. is violently
                        against nuclear proliferation.</p>
                    <p>If Israel is not going to get into nuclear production, why not accept <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> controls and let U.S. reassure <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> about Dimona. It is U.S. firm policy
                        to keep the U.A.R. from getting into nuclear production and it will do
                        everything it can to restrain them.</p>
                    <p>“I want to assure you,” the President said, “that we are not being naive
                        about <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>. What we want to do is
                        to try and prevent him from leaning over too far towards the Russians.”</p>
                    <p>The President summarized by listing the following six points:</p>
                    <p>1. On water, the U.S. will support the Johnston Plan.</p>
                    <p>2. On tanks, the U.S. will assist Israel in obtaining them.</p>
                    <p>3. On security, the U.S. will stand foursquare behind Israel.</p>
                    <p>4. On missiles, the U.S. Government feels that Israel is too worried about
                        primitive U.A.R. weapons.</p>
                    <p>5. With regard to nuclear weapons, the U.S. is against their
                        proliferation.</p>
                    <p>6. On the desalting program, the U.S. is ready to help as much as
                        possible.</p>
                    <p>The President expressed the view that the visit was good for both the United
                        States and Israel, for both the Prime Minister and his nation. Following the
                        visit, it will be possible for Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> to explain U.S. concerns and friendship to his
                        people.</p>
                    <p>The President said that he was glad that the issues had been kept out of the
                        pressures of the election year and that the whole matter has been kept
                        quiet. Because of this they can go to the Germans and be of help. The
                        President said that he saw a bright future for Israel. The Prime Minister
                        could leave knowing that the U.S. will help Israel in the future, both
                        morally and financially as much as she can.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> responded by
                        first reciting the basis for the feeling of the Israelis that they needed
                        additional strength. He said that after thousands of years of wandering, his
                        people were now trying again to take their fate into their own hands and to
                        do things for themselves. This was the meaning of going back home to Israel.
                        In Turkish rule the area of Palestine had been 100,000 square k.m. but now
                        Israel had been cut down to 20,000 sq. k.m. It was in this area that we tell
                        our people that they must work out their destiny by depending on themselves
                        and doing things for themselves. Of course, they always look for friends and
                        they were immensely fortunate in having the U.S. as a friend. But what he
                        told the people of Israel was to rely on their friends, but that the
                        fundamental importance for Israel was “do it yourself”. They had to build
                        their own agriculture and their <pb n="155" xml:id="pg_155" facs="0187"/>own
                        industry, their own army and all the other essentials of the nation. They
                        had to be able to create their own future. The problem of security went back
                        a long way. Even before Hitler there had been pogroms in Czarist Russia.
                        Therefore, security was the most important and the first consideration. (At
                        this point the President summoned into the room Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName>, and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName>
                        who were accompanied by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PS9">Shimon
                            Peres</persName>, the Israeli Deputy Minister of Defense.) As they were
                        sitting down, the President turned to the Prime Minister and said to him:
                            “<persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> are my Prime Ministers on Israeli
                        questions.” The President then said that the Prime Minister has just begun
                        his statement and that he wanted them to hear it. The Prime Minister
                        thereupon continued: “When the independence of Israel was proclaimed in 1948
                        we thought we could live in peace, but we found that we were encircled by
                        enemies. The recent visit by <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> served to give <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> additional prestige, additional armor and money. This
                        makes him a dangerous enemy. Israel knows that the U.S. is a real friend. We
                        believe this. We are told that there is a United States commitment to
                        Israel. But I cannot ask my people to rely on this alone. When I discuss
                        this matter with my people, the question they ask me is ‘do you have enough
                        tanks?’ It may be true that the Egyptian missiles are not yet accurate, but
                        the Tel Aviv area with a million people is an easy target. The man in the
                        street wants to hear from me that we are on guard. What if one day <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, even against the advice of
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> (the Prime Minister
                        interpolated that he thought <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>'s reference in his speeches in Egypt on Israel
                        had been somewhat mild in language, and that he did not believe that
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> wanted the destruction
                        of Israel or war against Israel) and against the wishes of the U.S. were to
                        attack Israel, he would do that if he felt that he could do it. Then, in one
                        day or two or three days he could do a great deal of damage. What the man in
                        the street in Israel wants to know is whether Israel would then be able to
                        protect itself, whether it would be strong enough to protect itself. No one
                        could forecast what other problems the U.S. would have at that time.”</p>
                    <p>On tanks, the Prime Minister insisted that only the M–48 would meet Israel's
                        needs. He said it would be bad if Israel were compelled to take the
                        Centurion. Israel had some Centurions and knew them. Israel cannot buy new
                        tanks every day and therefore it is very important for us that we should get
                        today the tanks we need, said the Prime Minister.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> pointed out that
                        the autonomy of the Centurion was four to five hours while that of the M–48
                        was 8 hours. This was very important to Israel. He said that if the Germans
                        objected to doing it directly, it could be done through Italy.</p>
                    <p>With regard to missiles, he said that if <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> was willing to give up his missiles Israel would
                        acquire none; but <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> already has
                        about <pb n="156" xml:id="pg_156" facs="0188"/>200. The Prime Minister
                        added: “I think that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> is
                        planning to build these missiles in the hundreds. We have some indications
                        of this. For example, we know that he bought quantities of steel. It is
                        impossible for me to believe that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> is not improving his missiles.” The Prime Minister
                        went on to say that Israel would be prepared to wait a year or two; but
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> is constantly improving
                        his missiles, and in the next 2 to 3 years <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> is likely to attack and to use them. <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> said he was always glad to hear
                        complimentary things, for it implied that the Israeli armed forces could
                        always overcome a 1 to 5 disadvantage. This might not always be true. At the
                        present time, <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> has 3 to 4 times
                        as many planes and 3 to 4 times as much armor.</p>
                    <p>At the present time the disparity between <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> and Israel in respect to numbers is one against 10 or
                        15 or 20—depending on whether we take only Egypt into account or also the
                        Arab countries. The same goes for tanks where the Arabs have 3 times as much
                        as Israel. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s advantage is
                        great.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister observed that he was sure it would be possible to make
                        peace with Lebanon; and though difficult, it would probably be possible to
                        make peace with <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>. But if
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> attacks, all the other
                        Arab states will join him. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>
                        said he did not see any way in which he could explain to his country, or
                        even his own political party, a failure to do something about the missile
                        threat. The Prime Minister said that he did not see any way as a citizen of
                        his country or as a leader to explain to his people that he would just sit
                        back and do nothing in relation to the missile threat. In any case, for a
                        year or two there would be no missiles in Israel. How could he go and
                        explain to the country or to his own political party or to the Foreign
                        Affairs and Security Committee of the Knesset, and when he is asked what he
                        is doing to face the missile threat simply reply: “The Americans told me
                        that the Egyptian missiles are no good.” <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> has always been the first in introducing new weapons.
                        He was the first in jets; he was the first in Komars and the first in
                        missiles. “I am told,” he said, “that my boys in the army are very good. But
                        it is too much for me to demand of my boys that they should face a situation
                        like this without the proper materiel at their disposal.” The Prime Minister
                        went on to say: “We cannot afford to lose. This may be our last stand in
                        history. The Jewish people have something to give to the world. I believe
                        that if you look at our history and at all the difficulties we have
                        survived, it means that history wants us to continue. We cannot survive if
                        we experience again what happened to us under Hitler. You may view the
                        situation otherwise and it may be difficult to grasp how we feel. I believe
                        you should understand us. It is important that you should understand
                        us.”</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister suggested that his visit would be successful if it had
                        helped the President and the American people to understand the situation of
                        Israel. What Israel wants is peace. Nothing less makes <pb n="157" xml:id="pg_157" facs="0189"/>sense. War made no sense for Israel. Israel
                        could not possibly conquer Egypt. But <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> did not have an equivalent attitude. What <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> was calling for was for driving the
                        Israelis into the sea. The Prime Minister said: “We want your help but we
                        feel that we must do everything that is within the power of a small nation
                        to do to protect itself. If you can persuade <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> to give up his tanks and missiles, we will do the
                        same.”</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister offered to destroy all of his arms if <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> would do likewise. Then the Prime
                        Minister went on to suggest that he would appreciate it if the President
                        would tell Erhard when he came to visit that the U.S. had an interest in
                        helping Israel and in Germany helping Israel. Historically, he felt the
                        Germans had an obligation to do so. The reparations they paid were merely
                        monetary compensation. The Prime Minister added: “The reason I think it
                        would be very important to tell this to Erhard is that sometimes we hear
                        from the Germans that they are not so sure that you are interested in them
                        helping us.”</p>
                    <p>On the question of the U.S. relationship to the Arab nations, the Prime
                        Minister said it was not in the interest of Israel that the U.S. break off
                        its relationships with any other nation. But he asked whether it would not
                        be possible for the United States to tell <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> to work out a development plan and to have assistance
                        rendered <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> go into the
                        development of Egypt rather than into other areas. He said that Egypt had
                        much to do. He said: “What I am saying is that you should be pushing Egypt
                        into development and building and out of the field of spending their
                        resources on armaments.”</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister suggested that in some instances it would be wise to help
                        Israel publicly. Khrushchev had no reluctance in publicly promising
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> everything he requested.
                        But when it comes to assistance to Israel, their friends feel it must be
                        done surreptitiously. It reminds the Prime Minister of the German
                        expression: “Don't greet me in public.” Perhaps a public greeting he said,
                        would show that the friends of Israel mean to support that state and be
                        conducive to world peace.</p>
                    <p>In summary the Prime Minister said:</p>
                    <p>1. Tanks—the tanks we need are the M–48. I am glad over your decision of the
                        tanks and I leave our meeting feeling that I am entitled to tell my
                        Government that we will have these tanks. It would be better if we could get
                        them direct for it would not be good if the Arabs were left in any
                        uncertainty that Israel would be helped in matters such as tanks. However,
                        if you do it indirectly, that is all right, for after all, the important
                        thing is that we should get the tanks that we need. But please do not push
                        us into the Centurions.</p>
                    <p>2. Missiles—there would be no missiles for 1 to 2 years.</p>
                    <pb n="158" xml:id="pg_158" facs="0190"/>
                    <p>3. Water—the support of the United States is appreciated very much.</p>
                    <p>4. Desalination—the statement of the President is good news. Israel is
                        prepared to pay rather more for water for irrigation than would be
                        considered possible in other countries. Therefore the project should be
                        feasible.</p>
                    <p>5. Dimona—I cannot agree that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
                        should be told the real situation in Dimona because <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> is an enemy. After 16 years they
                        withhold peace from Israel. I notice that in your joint communique with King
                            <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> there was included a
                        point of “just peace.” I don't understand the meaning of this term. I know
                        what peace means. What should have happened is that the armistice should
                        have been following immediately by peace. It would be a great thing if you
                        could induce our neighbors to change the armistice into peace instead of
                        pursuing escalation in tanks and missiles. In the meantime, while the U.A.R.
                        remains an enemy and is committed to the destruction of Israel, it would
                        seem inadvisable to communicate such matters to them. Besides, <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> has worked for years to become a
                        nuclear power. He will continue to do so. A message that Dimona is not
                        manufacturing nuclear weapons would have no effect.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister then adverted to refugees by saying that Shukayri<note n="2" xml:id="d65fn2">Ahmad Shuqayri, Palestinian representative to the
                            Arab League, was named chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization

                            May 28–June 2. Telegram 606 from Amman, June 3, commented on the
                            Congress, and airgram A–586 from Amman, June 17, transmitted unofficial
                            texts of the Palestinian National Charter and <gloss target="#t_PLO1">PLO</gloss> Constitution, which the Congress approved. (Both in
                            National Archives and Records Administration, <gloss target="#t_RG1">RG</gloss> 59, Central Files 1964–66, POL 3 PAL ENTITY)</note> says
                        there are refugees; but they really are not people within the classic
                        meaning of refugees. They are used by the Arab nations to develop enemies
                        against Israel. He stated that Israel was not engaged in nuclear weapons
                        production, but posed the question: “Why tell <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>?” He asked: “Why should we tell <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> when we don't know from him what he
                        is doing about missiles?”</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister concluded by saying that he thanked the President, for his
                        decision was a grand thing and very imaginative.</p>
                    <p>The President asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> to
                        comment and he made a brief statement on the need for cooperation on the
                        tank question and said that <persName corresp="#p_PS9">Peres</persName>
                        would hold various meetings while he was in this country in an effort to
                        establish a procedure whereby Israel would receive them. In the meantime,
                        there was a great need for secrecy.</p>
                    <p>Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> also made a
                        brief statement dealing with the need to reassure the Israelis by having
                        them inspect the 6th <pb n="159" xml:id="pg_159" facs="0191"/>Fleet and
                        other places where the military potential of the United States was
                        evident.</p>
                    <p>Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> said that he
                        agreed that it was necessary to add meaning and credibility to the U.S.
                        commitment. He added that tanks were the major issue and that he hoped that
                        could be worked out.</p>
                    <p>The President said that it was important that there should be a feeling of
                        security on Israel's part.</p>
                    <p>Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> said that
                        they were more hopeful about their strategy dealing with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> than the Prime Minister seemed to
                        believe.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> said that it was important
                        that the tank question be kept quiet. It is understood, he said, that only
                        three people in Italy would have to know about it.</p>
                    <p>The President then reviewed matters briefly, adding that there would be some
                        mutual assistance in intelligence matters. We would help Israel with our
                        knowledge of Arab intelligence and Israel would exchange information that
                        they had with us.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> suggested that it
                        would be helpful to have semi-annual meetings at the political and military
                        level where there could be mutual exchange of all matters of concern between
                        the two nations.</p>
                    <p>Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> said this
                        would be an excellent idea and that we would establish some method whereby
                        this can be accomplished.</p>
                    <p>The President closed the meeting by saying: “Well, this has been a good
                        beginning.” </p>

                        the President said to <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> yesterday
                        when they were alone. <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName> said that
                            <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> had been with them except
                        for the first 15 minutes. <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> was
                            <pb n="160" xml:id="pg_160" facs="0192"/>to do a memcon which had not

                        difficulty these private discussions cause.</p>
                    <p>The President assured <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName> that he
                        had followed the brief<note n="2" xml:id="d66fn2">Reference is apparently to

                        tank question and said we could not give them but we would help all we
                        could. He went into our concern about the missiles briefly. He said he hoped
                        they would bite the bullet on the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>. He
                        said don't force us to say publicly that we are behind you. He did not close
                        any deals. He mentioned Dimona. <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName>
                        said he did not think <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> should

                        the Dimona reassurances to the Arabs, the IAEA question and the details that

                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> inquired about
                        the status of Israel's request for tanks. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> replied that the President expected to speak to
                        Chancellor Erhard about West German capabilities to supply tanks. Between
                        approaches by the U.S. and by Israel we would make a real try. There were
                        also current conversations with the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>.
                        Adequate tanks should be available.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> said he did not
                        wish to be pushed to Centurions. The M–48 was superior. There appeared to be
                        a way to obtain M–48 tanks through an arrangement with Italy. He hoped we
                        would accept the Israeli viewpoint. He commented that Centurions were
                        expensive, but he did not wish to discuss pricing until prices were lower.
                        Israel was willing to take a number of Centurions to complete existing tank
                        units.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> said we would do
                        everything to help, including exploration of the arrangement with Italy.
                        There was, however, the Chieftain in the background. Cost was a problem
                        since it amounted to nearly $300,000 per unit. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> added that we foresaw problems with
                        the transparent arrangement with Italy. Security in Italy was not good. The
                        transaction was likely to become widely known.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PS9">Peres</persName> said failure to obtain M–48
                        tanks would be a great disappointment both politically and popularly. The
                        Centurion was not as good a tank, and lacked the range of the M–48. To buy
                        Centurions would be to eat and remain hungry. The cost of 300 Chieftain
                        tanks was excessive since they would cost $500,000 each including spares and
                        ammunition. The total package would amount to $150,000,000. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> interjected that we were not thinking
                        in terms of 300 Chieftain tanks.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PS9">Peres</persName> continued that the Mark-8
                        Centurion was costly and lacked a suitable engine. The best solution
                        economically and politically was the purchase of the M–48. Failure to
                        achieve this would be a shocking popular experience in Israel. He hoped the
                        U.S. would not retract its support for supply of tanks through Germany. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> suggested that the range of
                        tanks was not important since no one wished to go 300 miles. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PS9">Peres</persName> said that time of operation was more
                        important than range. It reduced maintenance and decreased
                        vulnerability.</p>
                    <pb n="162" xml:id="pg_162" facs="0194"/>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> noted that
                        deliveries of M–48's could begin in 8–12 months. Israel was already
                        negotiating with Italy on the problem of conversion. As to Centurion
                        availability, 48 would be available during 1964; 50–100 more in 1965;
                        Chieftains might be available by the end of 1965. Israel proposed to buy 48
                        Centurions in 1964 and perhaps 50 in 1965, but no more.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> noted that the M–48 tank
                        suggested a more offensive weapon than the shorter range tanks. We
                        understood, however, the advantages of tank “autonomy.” </p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> said he hoped to
                        be in a position upon his return to Israel to tell his government that the
                        tank matter had been resolved. If the U.S. and West Germany were interested,
                        the transaction could be kept secret for 2–3 years, by which time the M–48
                        would be in the same category as the Sherman tank today. In Italy only three
                        people need be fully informed of the transaction.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said this was a subject for
                        discussion with Chancellor Erhard. He could not speak for him. He believed
                        the problem of tanks could be met. We would take into consideration the
                        arguments made by the Israelis, particularly the need for tank
                        “autonomy.”</p>
                    <p>U.S. participants made brief reference to possible assistance to Israel in
                        adjusting the cost of high-priced European tanks but declined to discuss
                        details in the absence of more information on tank availabilities and other
                        elements of Israel's defense expenditures. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> said we would continue to press the Germans, but
                        were not anxious to break away from our policy of avoiding the supply of
                        offensive weapons to the Near East. We believed Israel could meet its needs
                        elsewhere.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion, the Prime Minister stressed that the proposed M–48 transaction
                        could be kept secret for 2–3 years. He also said Israel was spending
                        $450,000,000 every year for defense and could not afford not to follow up
                        the West German transaction. He hoped it would be possible to obtain
                        agreement in principle on the transaction from Chancellor Erhard.</p>
                    <p>The discussion ended with the understanding that any further progress on M–48
                        tank procurement must rest upon the decision of Chancellor Erhard.
                        Meanwhile, discussions on Centurions should continue.</p>

                    <p>For what it's worth, I gave Israelis a hard line after your meeting
                        yesterday, saying I knew that while you didn't want to press Israelis so
                        hard as to spoil good atmosphere of visit, you as well as rest of us were
                        disappointed at lack of Israeli response on any points. This may just have

                        warning to Kamel took), while Israelis are highly pleased. We also managed
                        to steer press successfully (so far) away from sensitive arms issue.</p>

                        suggested that the Israelis might wish to point out to the Shah that the
                        M–48A3 was practically the same as the M–60 and could be bought for a great
                        deal less. Deliveries wouldn't take place for a few years, but when Iran had
                        M–48A3s in quantity, this might be of help to Israel. <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName> stressed that we did not want any
                        Israeli approach to appear as being at US instance. <persName corresp="#p_PS9">Peres</persName> fully understood; he quickly grasped
                        the implications of Iran playing a possible future role in the M–48A3
                        problem, and recognized that this wasn't an immediate prospect but one a few
                        years off.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName> then said that, like Governor
                            <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName>, he felt <persName corresp="#p_PS9">Peres</persName> should get a clear picture of
                        Arab-Israeli policy from his visit; we had heard that <persName corresp="#p_PS9">Peres</persName> was one of those who questioned our
                        policy. The Middle East was an area where much more emotion than logic was
                        at play; this made it all the more imperative to sort out what was really
                        going on.</p>
                    <p>There seemed to be three “myths” about US policy, which <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName> wished to deal with candidly, on the
                        understanding that he was talking completely unofficially and personally,
                        and that he would not find such statements being bandied about. <persName corresp="#p_PS9">Peres</persName> fully agreed.</p>
                    <p>First was the myth that the US pursued a strictly “even-Handed” or
                        “impartial” policy, as between Israel and the Arabs. This was what we often
                        said publicly. But if one looked at actions, not words, it was clear that
                        from 1947 on our policy had basically favored Israel. We had been Israel's
                        strongest backer from the outset, financially and otherwise, and it was our
                        deterrent power (not that of the British, French, or anyone else) which
                        really provided Israel its insurance policy. What we did do was to seek an
                        “appearance” of balance in our policy, which <pb n="165" xml:id="pg_165" facs="0197"/>would permit us to exercise continued influence in the Arab
                        world. This influence was imperative in Israel's interest as well as ours,
                        because it served not only to protect US assets (oil and bases) in the area
                        but to limit Soviet penetration.</p>
                    <p>The Aswan Dam fiasco had been a blunder in our policy. We had been the ones
                        who in effect gave Khrushchev his golden opportunity to start peddling
                        Soviet arms in the Middle East. It was Soviet arms, not Arab words, which
                        created the real threat to Israel. So long as Arab words were only a
                        reflection of their impotence, Israel could afford to live with them. But it
                        was crucial that we not become so openly Israel's champions as to force the
                        Arabs to line up overtly with Moscow. In this event the real threat to
                        Israel would be magnified.</p>
                    <p>Second was the myth that the US had shifted to a pro-<persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> policy, and that he was our “chosen
                        instrument” in the Middle East. We were making a deliberate and calculated
                        effort to arrive at a basis for mutual cooperation with the man and country
                        which we regarded (as did Israel) as the fulcrum of the Arab world. But no
                        one who looked carefully at the facts could help but see the many places
                        where we were still containing <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s expansionist ambitions. How else could one interpret
                        the fact that we were still providing substantial aid to Libya, Sudan,
                        Ethiopia, Saudi Arabia, Jordan—in fact every country around the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. We were even willing to help Syria, except
                        that the Syrians were unhelpable. One thing was certain—<persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> saw clearly that we had not gone
                        overboard with him. We intended to do business with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> wherever mutual interests existed,
                        in order to provide him an alternative to out-and-out reliance on the Soviet
                        Union. So long as he had such an alternative he would take from both sides,
                        but would be no more interested in serving as Khrushchev's stalking horse in
                        the Middle East than ours.</p>
                    <p>The third myth was that the US could not be relied on to back Israel in a
                        pinch. Harping on this theme from some Israelis was becoming annoying here;
                        we didn't like to be told our word couldn't be relied upon, no matter how
                        nicely this allegation was dressed up. <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName> said he fully realized that no 100% guarantees were
                        possible in this world. Indeed we recognized the theoretical force of
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s argument that a
                        nation could rely totally only on its own resources. What we objected to so
                        vigorously was his feeling that an independent force of real practical
                        meaning could be developed. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>
                        thought he could tear off an arm, but in practice he might not be able to
                        tear off even a little finger. Ergo, could we afford to risk letting him
                        trigger World War III because of such a delusion? One could argue that
                        Israel had a much more legitimate case for an absolute deterrent than
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>—after all, it was
                        facing the Arabs not the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. But in fact
                        we saw no need for such a deterrent, given the US commitment. Even <pb n="166" xml:id="pg_166" facs="0198"/>more important, for Israel to take
                        this route would force the Arabs into Moscow's arms. It might even lead to
                        Soviet missile bases in the Nile delta. In any event, while neither Israel
                        nor any other nation could have 100% assurance that the US would defend it,
                        the all-important thing was what the potential aggressor thought. There was
                        no doubt in our minds here. We had made sure that the Arabs knew we would
                        intervene, and we thought unlikely any miscalculation on their part.</p>
                    <p>We then got onto the tank matter. <persName corresp="#p_PS9">Peres</persName>
                        explained how they proposed to handle the tank deal through Italy. Only
                        three people—Defense Minister Andreotti, his intelligence chief, and the
                        deputy intelligence chief would be witting of the ultimate tank destination.
                            [<hi rend="italic">1–1/2 lines of source text not declassified</hi>]
                        Since this would be an arms export from one <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> country to another, no licenses were required. The tanks
                        would end up in Naples and be reexported from there. [<hi rend="italic">1
                            line of source text not declassified</hi>]</p>
                    <p>The German <gloss target="#t_MOD1">MOD</gloss> at least wanted to sell all of
                        its 232 M–48A1s, so the Germans could say they were getting rid of these
                        earlier models, in order to standardize on M–48A2 or 3s (which they would
                        buy from us as replacements). The German Army would deliver the tanks to the
                        Italian Army, which would send them to the company for refitting. The tanks
                        would be refitted partly in Italy and partly in Israel. German Army
                        engineers would handle quality control in the Italian plant.</p>
                    <p> Andreotti had asked that 15–20 tanks be left for the Italian Army, which was
                        again interested in the M–48A3. As <persName corresp="#p_PS9">Peres</persName> put it, when Israel bought a new weapon, all sorts of
                        other countries became interested in it because of Israel's reputation for
                        being a wise purchaser. <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName> said
                        that the M–48 request proved the point, since the M–48A3 was unquestionably
                        the best tank buy at the price in the world today.</p>
                    <p>As to timing, it would take a year before the first tank got to Israel. There
                        would be about four shipments. It would be at least another year before the
                        Arabs found out. In response to <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName>'s question, <persName corresp="#p_PS9">Peres</persName>
                        said that Israel had kept its first Centurion purchases secret for 2–3
                        years. <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName> asked for a written
                        summary of these points for our use in talking with the Germans (an unsigned
                        memo furnished later by Gazit is attached).<note n="2" xml:id="d69fn2">Attached but not printed.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_PS9">Peres</persName> said that Israel wanted to buy
                        new engines, guns, etc. for the M–48s directly from the US. He thought this
                        would avoid messy financial problems, and was just as secure. Israel had
                        bought guns from us before. <persName corresp="#p_SFK1">Sloan</persName> was
                        dubious over whether <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> would want to do
                        this. We'd have to reserve our position while looking into the matter.</p>
                    <pb n="167" xml:id="pg_167" facs="0199"/>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_PS9">Peres</persName> also urged that we find some way
                        to provide ammunition and if possible spare parts at reduced prices from US
                        stocks. Sloan pointed out that US holdings of 105 mm. tank rounds were all
                        of recent manufacture. It would be difficult to declare them surplus. In
                        fact, we were still buying them for US use. We'd also look into this matter
                        but he didn't want to hold out false hopes.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName> mentioned to <persName corresp="#p_PS9">Peres</persName> in passing that he wasn't going to
                        belabor the missile question again, but wished to say that the secretive and
                        evasive way in which Israel responded to our frequent inquiries on this and
                        Dimona inevitably raised suspicions on our part. For the President of the US
                        to have to intervene personally and repeatedly to get the necessary
                        reassurances was frankly counter-productive; it only made us feel that
                        Israel really did have something to hide. As for Israel's missile program,
                        why was it that they wouldn't even answer our queries? <persName corresp="#p_PS9">Peres</persName> said that when one made an arrangement
                        with a third country and that country laid down certain conditions, it tied
                        Israel's hands. <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName> replied that
                        this was the first cogent explanation we'd had, but wasn't the US/Israel
                        relationship such that we were entitled to greater candor? He said we'd want
                        to talk with Israel further about missiles.</p>
                    <p>As the meeting broke up <persName corresp="#p_PS9">Peres</persName> said that
                        the Germans wanted to tell the French if they decided to provide tanks. He
                        thought the best way would be for <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> to mention it casually to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>. Westrick had agreed that the Israelis could do so
                        in this event. <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName> demurred that we
                        would not like to have our role in the arrangements revealed. <persName corresp="#p_PS9">Peres</persName> was sure this would be no problem,
                        commenting smilingly that when great men get together they don't get into
                        details.</p>

                        Subject: Arab refugees.</p>
                    <p>At dinner last night, <persName corresp="#p_SAEII1">Stevenson</persName>
                        discussed refugee question with <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> of Israel. After emphasizing
                        seriousness of problem for both <pb n="168" xml:id="pg_168" facs="0200"/>Israel and US in Near East and in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>,
                            <persName corresp="#p_SAEII1">Stevenson</persName> asked what plans Israel
                        has for dealing with problem. <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>
                        replied that he fully appreciated difficulties question presented for us but
                        that Israel had no new suggestions to advance. After expressing firm
                        opposition to Johnson proposal he said that adding 100,000 Arabs to the
                        250,000 now in Israel, and assuming the present rate of Jewish immigration
                        continued at about 30 to 35,000 per annum, the higher birth rate of Arabs
                        would “create a Cyprus situation” within 25 years. On this assumption he
                        estimated Arab population would become one quarter of total. Arabs will
                        force refugees back into Palestine by various devices and he was not sure
                        that any open-end formula could even restrict repatriation of 100,000.</p>
                    <p>While extremely cordial and appreciative of US and <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> problem, his position appeared inflexible and he advanced
                        sundry arguments as to why any increase in Arab population was hazardous for
                        Israel, including fact that Arabs do not serve in army. <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> referred repeatedly to integration of
                        many of refugees into Arab countries and left no alternative but absorption
                        of balance by Arabs.</p>
                    <p>Following his departure, Jacob Blaustein asked <persName corresp="#p_SAEII1">Stevenson</persName> if he had discussed refugee problem, adding that
                        if formula could be devised which would limit Arab repatriation to 100,000,
                        he felt confident <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> could be persuaded to
                        accept it in final settlement of problem. Stevenson concluded that <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>'s official position at least no more
                        tractable than Ben Gurion's.</p>
                    <p>Plimpton also brought subject up with <persName corresp="#p_PS9">Peres</persName> (Deputy Defense Minister) saying that time pressures
                        had prevented its being discussed in Washington, but that US Government
                        regarded problem as very serious one for Israel and US in Near East and in
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. We realize that there is no overall
                        solution in sight, but we do look to Israel for constructive suggestions
                        that would lead to some partial progress. <persName corresp="#p_PS9">Peres</persName> entirely negative: he said only solution was to
                        abolish <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss> and turn over decreasing
                        amounts of relief funds to host governments and let them handle refugees
                        pending absorption into local economies. He rejected concept of admitting
                        limited number of refugees on an experimental basis to see what could happen
                        and shied away from compensation problem.</p>

                    <p>In seventy-minute farewell interview with President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> on June 7, I made brief tour
                        d'horizon of specific current issues between USA–<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> as reported Embtel 2975.<note n="4" xml:id="d71fn4">Dated
                            June 8. (National Archives and Records Administration, <gloss target="#t_RG1">RG</gloss> 59, Central Files 1964–66, POL <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>-US) </note> At close of this I turned
                        to subject of Near East arms control, saying this was one of most
                        fundamental and urgent USA interest in Middle East area. Progress in this
                        field with <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> assistance would form strong
                        bond of mutual interest and would help keep relationship of two countries in
                        balance even when differences on specific matters generated some heat.
                        President Kennedy had inaugurated discussion of this topic beginning with
                            <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> mission last summer.
                        President Johnson equally concerned in and urgent for it.</p>
                    <p>I opened presentation by handing President original copy of President
                        Johnson's letter of May 20 re this subject. I then recalled last discussion
                        (Embtel 2632)<note n="5" xml:id="d71fn5">
                            <ref target="#d52">Document 52</ref>.</note> regarding UAR “declaration
                        of intent” on non-acquisition nuclear arms and acceptance <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards. President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> immediately responded by saying he
                        was prepared to answer President Johnson's letter with a statement that
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> had no intention of building or
                        procuring atomic weapons. As to <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>, he
                        would be prepared to accept this international safeguard at time
                        construction of nuclear power plant in <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                        imminent. </p>
                    <p>To accept safeguards before any possibility of plant existing would put him
                        in difficult position since he had no reason to issue statement and he would
                        be accused of doing so only under “great power pressure”. However, once
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> decided to build nuclear
                        installation it would be appropriate to [accept?] <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards and this he was prepared to do. He requested I
                        personally and directly inform President Johnson of this.</p>
                    <pb n="170" xml:id="pg_170" facs="0202"/>
                    <p>In response I suggested statement covering this might be included in same
                        letter that disavowed intent acquire nuclear weapons. We would hope this
                        letter could be discussed quietly and off the record while in draft form to
                        be sure it met purposes both parties. President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> opined this would be possible although he did not
                        give me a firm commitment.</p>
                    <p>I then turned to larger topic of Arab-Israeli arms race, opening presentation
                        with detailed recapitulation of reftel 5592. In connection with this I cited
                            <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> newspaper report re possible number of
                        missiles in 1966 and development of CW warheads [garble—possibility] that
                        made international community nervous and would certainly generate matching
                        response from Israel. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> said he
                        had not seen article in question but had read report in Bonn newspaper
                        claiming <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> developing nuclear warheads for
                            <gloss target="#t_SSM1">SSM</gloss>'s. He said this was completely
                        untrue, as letter assurance to President Johnson would make clear. Beyond
                        this I could not draw him out [garble] number of missiles or type of
                        warheads being developed.</p>
                    <p>On basis above, I expressed deep concern that level of weapon sophistication
                        was rising so rapidly that ultimate explosion in Middle East seemingly
                        unavoidable. Since Israel and <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> now
                        apparently in defensive positions sufficiently balanced to provide mutual
                        security, this seemed logical and most favorable moment to consider how arms
                        level might be frozen. While fully recognizing inhibitions to direct <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>-Israeli contact USG believed that quiet,
                        unpublicized third part action could well bring arms growth to halt, without
                        imperiling reasonable security interests of both parties.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> answered by saying <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> defensive position versus Israel was indeed
                        much better than it had been five years ago. Israel had a certain advantage
                        in ground to air missiles since the country was so small that a dozen Hawk
                        installations would adequately protect its air fields. In contrast, <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> so large with air fields necessary in such
                        scattered areas that protection by ground to air missiles not entirely
                        practical. Hence his military people agreed <gloss target="#t_SSM1">SSM</gloss>'s as necessary counterbalance to values Israel derives from
                        Hawk installations.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> admitted arms escalation was
                        under way, saying every time Israel acquired more sophisticated aircraft, he
                        had been forced to do same or to seek some compensatory weapon. In the
                        beginning Soviets had sold arms to <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> at
                        30% discount, but during past few years they had charged <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> full price. This applied specifically to
                        last two purchases of Super <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>s. While
                        recognizing this continuous matching and over-matching of armaments
                        expensive and unending, he had real problem with his military men who kept
                        urging increase of quantity and sophistication of arms. “All military men
                        are alike—American, Russian, and Egyptian,” the President said. His problem
                        is <pb n="171" xml:id="pg_171" facs="0203"/>how to bring about halt in
                            <gloss target="#t_SSM1">SSM</gloss> increments without being open to
                        accusation he has been bludgeoned into this by great power pressure.</p>
                    <p>I immediately rejoined that it was not great power pressure which urged the
                        move but inherent and inescapable danger of arms race in itself. Unless
                        Israel and <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> could find some way to scale
                        down or stop arms race the day of final conflict marched inexorably nearer.
                        Should such a conflict come, it might be much more difficult to control than
                        was Arab-Israeli clash of 1956. Then only two major powers were
                            involved—<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and USA. Now a third
                        power has appeared on scene—Communist China. While <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and USA had made some initial steps toward approaching
                        problem of arms limitation and, I opined, shared mutual interests in
                        avoiding world conflagration, same could not be said of Communist China.
                        President agreed ChiComs a new and intransigent element on world scene. I
                        then traversed again arguments for seeking unpublicized, basic steps towards
                        arms limitation, saying we would welcome any specific ideas he could put
                        forward. This requires broad and statesmanlike thinking and no other Arab
                        leader either in position or with capability to do this but <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> himself. We therefore would welcome
                        his ideas. President could be sure we would continue to present this topic
                        to him both by Ambassadorial representation and through direct communication
                        between highest Government sources. If at this time he told me that door was
                        closed and this matter was not to be raised again, I would of course report
                        this to my Government. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
                        answered he took no such view and would look forward to further
                        representations on matter.</p>
                    <p>In course of above presentation I specifically reviewed matter of inspection
                        of production of fissionable material re reftel 5566.</p>
                    <p>At close of interview <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> spent
                        some moments discussing our personal relationship, expressed his gratitude
                        for the 43 interviews we have had during the past 35 months, then
                        accompanied me to my car for a final farewell.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: I believe we should now move to rivet down
                        statement on non-acquisition of nuclear arms and <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> commitment. Although no concrete progress made in general
                        arms control, I believe <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> is
                        certainly open to further and more specific approaches in this field. I
                        doubt if much will be gained by continuing to urge that he “put his ideas
                        forward.” Here as elsewhere <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
                        usually reacts rather than acts. Most productive next move would probably be
                        a detailed proposal from <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>, probably
                        presented by special and high ranking Presidential emissary to which

                    <p rend="center">POSSIBLE U.S. INITIATIVES ON ARAB-ISRAEL ISSUES IN 1964–65</p>
                    <p>1. U.S. interests in the Near East have long been vulnerable to pressures
                        arising out of indigenous social change, the outward thrust of Arab
                        nationalism against the remaining points of Western privilege, Communist
                        ambitions, and intra-area disputes, particularly the Arab-Israel conflict
                        with attendant military escalation. Nevertheless, we have managed to
                        maintain our basic interests in the area—access, transit, oil, and the
                        integrity of Israel and other states—at relatively low costs. Our objective
                        is to continue to do so.</p>
                    <pb n="174" xml:id="pg_174" facs="0206"/>
                    <p>2. Despite the bellicose statements we hear, neither Israel nor the Arab
                        states are prepared to gamble on settling their differences by war. Neither
                        side has confidence it could win or would be permitted to keep its gains, or
                        even limit the course of hostilities or number of participants. Nonetheless,
                        escalation to sophisticated weaponry and possibly (first on the Israeli
                        side) to nuclears is intensifying the risk of accidental war and decreasing
                        the certainty that we can deter or stop it.</p>
                    <p>3. Israeli and Arab positions on their principal disputes continue to be set
                        in concrete. At best there is tacit acceptance of most elements of the
                        stalemate. Our minimum objective is to prevent this stalemate from blowing
                        up; if it persists, it might gradually take the shape of a modus vivendi.
                        Our maximum present objective is to find ways to dissolve some of the most
                        dangerous of its aspects. The problem is to encourage the modus vivendi
                        without stimulating Arab-Israel tension by what we do or fail to do.</p>
                    <p>4. Israeli and Arab capabilities to resist unpalatable compromises continue
                        high. Neither side is particularly responsive to initiatives by the U.N. or
                        by individual nations, including the U.S. In 1964–65 the U.S. should be
                        relatively well placed to use its limited leverage, however. Israeli
                        confidence in U.S. security assurances has risen. Some Arab confidence in
                        the U.S. has been demonstrated and Arab reactions to several difficult
                        developments (e.g., Jordan waters diversion, <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> visit) have proved containable. The U.S. can expect
                        to have an active administration with a strong mandate.</p>
                    <p>5. It follows that certain limited initiatives may be possible.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">On the Arms Race:</p>
                    <p>1. Our objectives are</p>
                    <p>a. To concentrate above all else on preventing the proliferation of nuclears
                        (which are within the capability of Israel in 2–4 years), and</p>
                    <p>b. To resist further rocket programs and thus impede the spread of nuclear
                        delivery systems and associated weaponry.</p>
                    <p>2. In working toward these objectives, we should</p>
                    <p>a. Press on urgently with efforts to bring <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> to self-denial of further rocketry and to <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> inspection of any reactors. He would find
                        this a good deal if it resulted in blocking rocketry and nuclears in Israel.
                        This effort with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> should be the
                        early business of our new Ambassador, and perhaps of a special Presidential
                        emissary. After the election, it might call for a visit to Egypt by the
                        Secretary of State or the Vice President, followed perhaps by a <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> visit to the U.S. Hope of success in
                        this effort would rest on maintenance of effective political and economic
                        relations with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>.</p>
                    <p>b. While working on <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, continue
                        pressing against the Israeli rocket program and registering our unalterable
                        opposition to any Israeli activity in the direction of nuclear weaponry.</p>
                    <pb n="175" xml:id="pg_175" facs="0207"/>
                    <p>c. Exploit any breakthrough with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> to get categoric equivalent assurance from
                        Israel.</p>
                    <p>d. Consult with Britain, France, Germany and, as necessary, other Allies on
                        cooperative actions to impede Israeli and Arab development of rocketry or
                        nuclears.</p>
                    <p>e. Consider a possible understanding with the Soviets on mutual denial of
                        assistance in nuclears and rocketry to Israel and the Arabs.</p>
                    <p>3. There are also dangers in the conventional arms race. We should be alert
                        to targets of opportunity to restrain and reduce this competition.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Regarding Refugees:</p>
                    <p>We see no prospect in 1964–65 for another major refugee initiative. Without
                        some U.S. effort, however, the refugee issue could become more troublesome
                        than it is. We can usefully pursue the following limited objectives:</p>
                    <p>1. Follow up the PCC property identification report by urging Israelis to
                        take some initiative now to accept applications from individual Arabs for
                        settlement of property claims and to enlarge possibilities for the reunion
                        of families. A small office might be attached to the PCC to facilitate this
                        process.</p>
                    <p>2. Set the stage for expansion of the PCC to five members, leaving the door
                        open for ultimate U.S. withdrawal.</p>
                    <p>3. As proposed from the 1950's onward, begin devolution of <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss> to national units working under
                        supervision of individual host states. As a two-year process, this might
                        start with an agreement, to be sought by the <gloss target="#t_UNSYG1">UNSYG</gloss> strongly supported by the U.S., with the U.A.R. to take
                        over administration of relief and works in the Gaza strip.</p>
                    <p>4. Make some cut in the U.S. contribution to <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss> for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>-1966, as a means of
                        pressing the SYG and <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss> to tackle
                        rectification and reduction and look to national management of relief and
                        works.</p>
                    <p>5. Accept a two-year extension of <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss> on
                        the understanding that efforts would be made by the SYG along the lines of
                        (3) above.</p>
                    <p>6. Pre-empt the General Assembly situation by laying the groundwork for a
                        middle-of-the-road resolution.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Other Issues:</p>
                    <p>1. We should remain steady on our present course of supporting all works in
                        consonance with the 1955 Unified Plan including leadership in finding
                        finances for the Maqarin Dam.</p>
                    <p>2. We should continue to urge maximum utilization of <gloss target="#t_UNTSO1">UNTSO</gloss> including participation by the parties
                        in <gloss target="#t_ISMAC1">ISMAC</gloss> and EIMAC.</p>
                    <p>3. We see no prospect of fresh initiatives in this period on such other
                        questions as boundaries, boycott, and freedom of navigation.</p>

                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BJS1">Badeau</persName> was received by the
                        President at 12:45 <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> for his final call
                        prior to his resignation from government service.</p>
                    <p>The President opened the conversation by expressing warm appreciation for the
                        Ambassador's fine work in Cairo and regret that he was terminating his
                        service. The Ambassador responded by expressing his own regret that
                        unavoidable personal responsibilities had made his resignation necessary. He
                        had found the post in Cairo challenging and stimulating, and felt that
                        significant progress had been made in furthering American interests in the
                        Arab world as these relate to the United Arab Republic. The Ambassador
                        particularly noted the strong support accorded him by the Department of
                        State and the Administration and said that, in whatever progress has been
                        made, this was a chief factor.</p>
                    <p>The President then inquired as to the current state of American-Egyptian
                        relations. The Ambassador answered that basic relations continued to be
                        good. Throughout his 35 months of service in Cairo, President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> had received him frequently, and the
                        dialogue thus developed had proved highly useful, both in setting forth the
                        American viewpoint and in avoiding incipient conflicts. In recent months,
                        however, the Egyptian Government had been somewhat suspicious that the
                        United States might be changing its policy. While no concrete evidence of
                        such a change existed, the pressures of an election year and the fact of a
                        new Administration made policy-making circles in Egypt unusually sensitive
                        to American actions.</p>
                    <p>The President then asked what course American policy could most profitably
                        take in the future in relation to the United Arab Republic. The Ambassador
                        replied with a brief summary of American relations <pb n="177" xml:id="pg_177" facs="0209"/>with Egypt since the rise of the present
                        Revolutionary Regime in 1952. During this time, the Ambassador pointed out,
                        the United States had followed four distinct policies toward Egypt. The
                        number and variety of these policies indicated something more than changing
                        administrations in the United States, although such changes were naturally a
                        factor in them. Basically it had been difficult for the United States to
                        define and pursue steadily a single policy toward Egypt because there are
                        certain mutual irritants which periodically push the two nations apart.
                        Twice during the last 12 years Egypt and the United States had approached a
                        major confrontation. The first occasion was in 1955, at the time of Egypt's
                        first arms purchases from the Soviet Bloc. The second resulted from the Suez
                        Canal nationalization, and came to its climax in the landing of American
                        Marines in Lebanon in 1958.</p>
                    <p>On each occasion it seemed as though both countries were prepared to throw
                        their weight into a major confrontation. However, just as this became
                        imminent both parties stopped, being unwilling to take the final step. In
                        effect, they said: “We cannot do this to each other; let us pick up the
                        pieces and try again.”</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador said that the reason for this lay in the mutual capacity to
                        hurt each other's interests, which both Egypt and the United States
                        possessed. Were Egypt determined to do so it could cause considerable
                        trouble for the United States in areas of the Near East where there are
                        basic American interests—as witness the recent Libyan response to President
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s call for the abolition
                        of Wheelus Air Base. Equally the United States had the capacity to hurt
                        Egypt in areas such as Yemen, Syria, and Jordan if she were determined to do
                        so. Neither party possessed as great a capacity to hurt as it professed, but
                        the capacity was sufficiently large to imperil certain basic national
                        interests.</p>
                    <p>It was this fact that had prevented a major confrontation in the past. The
                        Ambassador believed that it would continue to make a major confrontation
                        unlikely in the future unless the U.A.R. should threaten an American
                        interest of so basic a character that the United States would be willing to
                        risk imperiling its position in adjacent Arab lands. This was to say that
                        American-Egyptian relations might well continue to fluctuate between
                        cordiality and opposition, but always avoiding the final step of major
                        confrontation.</p>
                    <p>If this analysis was correct, the Ambassador said, it suggested that the two
                        countries should strive to develop an on-going relation similar to that in
                        existence between many countries. This relationship assumed a continuing
                        bond based upon mutual interests but allowed room for direct opposition on
                        specific issues. To illustrate this the Ambassador cited the American-French
                        relationship. At the moment there were several aspects of French policy with
                        which the United States strongly disagreed, i.e., the independent nuclear
                        deterrent, certain attitudes toward <pb n="178" xml:id="pg_178" facs="0210"/>
                        <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, opposition to British participation
                        in the Common Market, and policy toward Communist China and Southeast Asia.
                        It could be expected that America would oppose France on all these issues,
                        but neither the United States nor France assumed that such opposition called
                        into question the basic and longstanding Franco-American tie.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador suggested that this approach could be taken toward the U.A.R.
                        It was inevitable that both the United States and the U.A.R. would find it
                        necessary to oppose specific policies adopted by the other. Egypt had long
                        opposed American policy toward Israel, while in recent months the United
                        States had been in opposition to U.A.R. policy on foreign bases and the
                        British position in South Arabia. But opposition on such specific issues
                        need not continuously call into question the basic mutual and continuing
                        interests on which a lasting American-Egyptian policy could be built.</p>
                    <p>During the past three years a good beginning had been made in identifying and
                        supporting these basic and mutual interests. If this support could be
                        continued, the United States might be able to enjoy a reasonable and
                        long-term relation with the U.A.R., yet retain freedom of movement on
                        specific issues.</p>
                    <p>The President inquired as to whether President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> would understand such a sophisticated policy. The
                        Ambassador replied that he thought the chances were reasonably good for its
                        acceptance. During a long and cordial farewell visit with President
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> on June 7,<note n="2" xml:id="d74fn2">See <ref target="#d71fn4">Document 71 and footnote
                                4</ref> thereto. </note> the Ambassador had advanced this view in
                        detail. After discussing some aspects of it, President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> had replied that this was probably
                        “the only possible policy between the two countries.” The Ambassador
                        recognized that it would be difficult for some Americans to understand this
                        approach—and even more difficult for some Egyptians. Nevertheless, it was
                        the only alternative to the “off-again, on-again, gone-again” relation which
                        had vexed the two countries during the past 12 years.</p>
                    <p>In concluding the interview, President Johnson suggested that he might wish
                        to communicate with President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
                        as a result of this talk with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BJS1">Badeau</persName>. With this, interview closed.</p>

                        basically because we are doing for the Lebanese, Saudis and possibly the
                        Jordanians what we would not do for the three main Arab countries on the
                        grounds that Lebanon is acknowledged by Israel to be no threat. Sec said he
                        did not see our selling supersonic aircraft to any of the Arab neighbors if
                        we are not prepared to sell to Israel. T said there was a paper which has
                        been on its way to the Sec since April; last week we asked for the beginning
                        of a study on the implications of the whole idea of military sales; there
                        has been a great change in what is being offered without any policy
                        considerations being given. Sec asked if we asked Israelis if they minded
                        what they would say. T said they would rather we sell nothing to any Arab
                        country but they have accepted tacitly our support of these three. Sec said
                        he had an uneasy feeling that we do not have our policy lines straightened
                        out on this issue; let's give some thought to that; it would be possible for
                        govts in these three to change or for united command to be set up. T agreed;

                    <p>34. Ambassador should approach FonOff at highest appropriate level to make
                        following points:</p>
                    <p>1) We again wish to counsel greatest restraint on <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> in matter of patrolling in and around <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>s.<note n="2" xml:id="d77fn2">A July 13
                            memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> to
                                <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> states that the
                            Israeli Charge informed the Department of an Israeli decision to resume
                            patrolling that morning in an area where from July 2 to 6 there had been
                            three separate Israel-Syrian clashes. (Ibid.)</note> At this juncture
                        with tensions running high it idle to argue over what constitutes violation
                        of <gloss target="#t_GAA1">GAA</gloss>
                        <pb n="181" xml:id="pg_181" facs="0213"/>and what does not. Important thing
                        is avoid incident which could get out of hand with unpredictable
                        consequences and no benefit to anyone, including Israel.</p>
                    <p>2) However if Israel does feel that a show of its right to patrol was
                        necessary, that right was reasserted on July 13, fortunately without Syrian
                        reaction. Accordingly we strongly urge that patrolling again be suspended in
                        order avoid senseless and perhaps dangerous incident. Such prudent course
                        would cost Israel nothing.</p>
                    <p>3) In circumstances we would also urge <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
                        suspend any other extraordinary military activity which might be construed
                        by <gloss target="#t_SARG1">SARG</gloss> as provocative, especially since
                        Arab dels to <gloss target="#t_MAC1">MAC</gloss>s reportedly meeting in
                        Damascus. (We referring especially to paradrop reported by ACOS Marsh, but
                        to protect him, you should not mention this specifically unless you have
                        word of it from other sources.)</p>
                    <p>4) We hope <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> will renew its excellent

                        and Jordan's participation in the Unified Arab Command (<gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss>) set up as a result of decisions taken at
                        the Arab Summit meeting in January, 1964 are beginning to pose some nettling

                        Jordan from the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and the Soviet Union to
                        expand its forces and to begin to “standardize” on Soviet military
                        equipment. This graphically portrays the complexities of one of these
                        problems.</p>
                    <p>1. The King and his military have been interested for some time in expanding
                        and modernizing Jordan's forces and the “confirmed requirement” for a
                        squadron of twenty supersonic jet fighters, additional tanks, and other
                        modern equipment to be provided at <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss>
                        expense is tempting.</p>
                    <p>2. At the same time, the King has been told by the Egyptians that the primary
                        initiative for the introduction of Soviet equipment into Jordan came from
                        Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> who during
                        his visit to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> this spring urged the
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> strongly to pressure the Jordanians
                        to accept Soviet equipment in the interest of breaking the western monopoly
                        on arms in Jordan.</p>
                    <p>3. The King tells us he insisted in his discussions with the <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> that Jordan could satisfy its need from the
                        United States and was authorized to negotiate for the equipment decided on.
                        If we are unwilling to provide the equipment, Soviet equipment will be
                        delivered either through the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> or directly
                        from the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>The King's representative, Brigadier Amer <persName corresp="#p_KGA2">Khammash</persName> is now in Washington with a shopping list. (He is
                        responding to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s
                            <pb n="183" xml:id="pg_183" facs="0215"/>suggestion to King Husayn
                        during the April visit that Jordan give the United States an opportunity to
                        sell hardware when Jordan had funds from the <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss>.) Jordan reportedly is to receive initially five million
                        pounds sterling from the <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> to contract for
                        its requirements. The <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> has “guaranteed”
                        the Jordanians continuing funds and sources of supply even if the <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> should disappear.</p>
                    <p>Jordan has agreed with the <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> to add the
                        irregular 9,000-man National Guard to the regular army, to alter the army
                        brigade organization to include greater firepower, supporting armor, and
                        increase in the number of brigades and brigade strengths, and to add a
                        squadron of 20 supersonic fighters to the <gloss target="#t_RJAF1">RJAF</gloss>. Counting on our concern at the prospect of Soviet
                        aircraft in Jordan, they are requesting twenty F–104–G aircraft from us.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Problems Posed</p>
                    <p>Should we fail to hold the line on sale of supersonic aircraft and other
                        sophisticated hardware to Jordan, we would be subject to pressures from the
                        other Arab states and Israel, thus encouraging the Near Eastern arms
                        rivalry. Israel's reaction to creation of an air cover for Jordan's army, be
                        it made up of Soviet or Western aircraft, is another factor entering the
                        equation. We must also recognize the inevitably adverse effect on the Jordan
                        budget of an expanded and more costly military establishment if <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                        commitments of support are not carried out.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Actions We Are Taking</p>
                    <p>In coordination with Defense we have developed a position designed to
                        persuade the Jordanians to concentrate on modernization rather than
                        expansion of their forces. We will make clear to Brigadier <persName corresp="#p_KGA2">Khammash</persName>, and subsequently to King Husayn,
                        that yielding to <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> pressure to accept Soviet equipment poses grave risks to
                        Jordan's integrity and to U.S.-Jordan relations. We will seek to persuade
                        Jordan of the disadvantages of acquiring aircraft beyond its present
                        inventory of Hawker Hunters until Jordan can maintain and operate these
                        effectively. If we are unable to accomplish this, to preclude Jordan's being
                        forced to accept <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>s, we will indicate our
                        interest in facilitating Jordan's acquisition of a modern Western,
                        preferably British, jet interceptor. With respect to ground equipment, we
                        are proposing that we assist Jordan in the formulation of a long-range plan
                        for equipping and modernizing its ground forces within Jordan's capability
                        to operate, maintain, and support.</p>
                    <p>We have discussed this problem informally with the British and are awaiting
                        London's comments on our proposed position. The British apparently are aware
                        that the <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> has advised Jordan not to
                        acquire British military equipment.</p>

                    <p>The decisions we must take with regard to the Jordanian requests are, of
                        course, relevant to our overall Near Eastern arms policy. The accompanying

                        is under heavy pressure on three fronts: 1) US balance of payments
                        considerations; 2) the desire of Israel and its supporters for modern US
                        weaponry; and 3) rising Arab arms appetites generated by the formation of
                        the United Arab Command. The particular immediate problem is the Jordanian
                        arms request. The paper concludes that we must continue to hold the line and
                        suggests firmness with Jordan in order to avert a major crisis in our
                        overall relations with the Arabs and Israel. (At Tab 4 is an outgoing

                        individual US Government agencies.</p>
                    <p>The paper recommends: 1) that if necessary you seek Presidential approval for
                        continuation of our established Near Eastern arms policy; and 2) in the

                        recommendation, that you seek Presidential approval for his informing the
                        Secretary of Defense of the decision to follow established Near East arms
                        policy. However, <gloss target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss> plans further
                        consultation with <persName corresp="#p_MNJT1">McNaughton</persName> and
                            <persName corresp="#p_SPOA1">Solbert</persName> and will inform you as
                        to whether differences can be resolved.</p>
                    <p>c) An information memorandum (Tab 3)<note n="5" xml:id="d79fn5">
                            <ref target="#d78">Document 78</ref>.</note> which reviews the

                        persuade the Jordanians to concentrate on modernization rather than
                        expansion of their forces. It points out that the decisions we must take
                        with regard to the Jordanian request are relevant to our overall Near East
                        arms policy, and concludes that your re-affirmation of this policy will be

                        this week. He's told us that either US must sell a squadron of F–104s and a
                        lot of ground force equipment (to be paid for with United Arab Command fund)
                        or Jordan will have to buy from the Soviets. </p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> is inclined to bow with the wind and
                        offer F–5As, contingent on the other Arabs actually making the money
                        available to Jordan (which most of us doubt). State is willing to show some
                        give on ground force items, but balks at planes: (1) It would be economic
                        insanity for Jordan to take on a heavy new arms burden—even if the other
                        Arabs paid for the hardware, maintenance alone would be a heavy additional
                        burden on a Jordanian economy already subsidized to tune of $45 million this
                        year by us; (2) if it gets out we're offering planes to Jordan, Israelis may
                        come in with a big pre-election plea for arms too; (3) in any case, these
                        arms are for announced purpose of backing Arab scheme to divert Jordan
                        headwaters—can we be in position of selling arms to support an action we
                        oppose? </p>

                        best course probably is to show some give on ground force stuff but stall on
                        planes, telling Hussein we have deep reservations so will check our bet till

                    </list>
                    <p>1. Jordan, as a member of the recently formed United Arab Command (<gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss>), has requested the United States to sell
                        various types of military equipment, including twenty (20) supersonic
                        fighter aircraft. It has been reported that Jordan will be forced to accept
                        supersonic aircraft from the Soviets or the United Arab Republic (<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>), if the United States refuses to sell
                        them. The State Department proposes to take the position that “The United
                        States cannot provide supersonic aircraft to Jordan at this time.” </p>
                    <p>2. The basis for the State Department position is not known; however, it does
                        not appear to be consistent with decisions of this type for other Arab
                        countries. Lebanon, Libya, and Saudi Arabia have been authorized to purchase
                        supersonic fighter aircraft from the United States, and it is to be expected
                        that these authorizations are common knowledge among all Arab countries. </p>
                    <p>3. If the proposed US position is reversed and sale of supersonics to Jordan
                        is authorized, certain complications can be anticipated. The reaction of
                        Israel may prove to be a problem, although the US Ambassador to Israel
                        doubts that the accretion in Jordan's military strength would seriously
                        worry Israel. On the other hand, he has information that Israel would be
                        seriously concerned over the presence of <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                        instructors, technicians, and other military personnel in Jordan, which can
                        be expected if Jordan procures supersonics from other than Western sources.
                        The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> Ambassador to Israel generally agrees
                        to these views. The over-all effect on the Middle East arms balance would be
                        an addition to the existing numerical superiority of supersonics available
                        to the <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> in comparison with Israel.
                        However, the Free World Air Intelligence Briefs indicate the <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> already possesses 475 supersonics as
                        opposed to 179 in the Israeli Air Force. The addition of twenty (20) more
                        supersonic aircraft to the <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> inventory
                        will not appreciably contribute to the existent imbalance. </p>
                    <p>4. On the other hand, there are implications inherent in the refusal to sell
                        supersonic aircraft to Jordan. The most significant of these appears <pb n="188" xml:id="pg_188" facs="0220"/>to be the potential loss of the
                        restraining influence which the United States can exert on Jordan.
                        Furthermore, the US position of influence likely would be replaced by the
                        Soviet or <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> Government, either of which
                        would be detrimental to Israeli and Western interests. </p>
                    <p>5. The basic issue appears to be not the selection of a position most
                        advantageous to the United States; instead it appears to be the problem of
                        selecting a US position that is least detrimental to our national interests.
                        If Jordan is sincere in the goal to obtain supersonic aircraft, and there is
                        ample indication that this is true, then it appears that US interests would
                        suffer more if they were provided from Soviet/<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> sources than would be the case if the United States were to
                        provide them. If Jordan and the <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> are not
                        sincere, or the proposal fails for financial or other reasons, then the
                        United States might very well gain by making the offer in principle and not
                        having to fulfill it in the final analysis. </p>
                    <p>6. <gloss target="#t_CINCSTRIKE1">CINCSTRIKE</gloss>/USCINCMEAFSA recommends
                        that the United States agree in principle to sell high performance fighters
                        to Jordan, and further concludes that, with proper phasing and adequate
                        supervision, Jordan could support a twelve (12) to sixteen (16) plane
                        squadron both financially and operationally. Under any circumstances, it is
                        obvious that the United States must eventually consider provision of
                        supersonic aircraft to Jordan if the United States is to remain the source
                        of fighter aircraft. The current Jordanian fighter aircraft is the Hawker
                        Hunter, twelve of which the United States bought for Jordan. These aircraft
                        will become unserviceable over the next few years and a replacement will be
                        required in the supersonic category, since all currently produced fighters
                        are supersonic. </p>
                    <p>7. In view of the above, the Joint Chiefs of Staff recommend that the United
                        States agree in principle to sell supersonic fighter aircraft to Jordan. The
                        type, phasing of delivery, and other details should be subject to
                        negotiations involving finances, sincerity of <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> intentions, and aircraft availabilities. While the F–5
                        might be considered as a suitable aircraft for Jordan, the United States
                        should be prepared to offer an appropriate model of the F–104 if necessary
                        to preclude acceptance of <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>/Soviet
                        aircraft. </p>

                    <p>1. Keeping in mind that there is no possibility of an increase in US budget
                        support for Jordan, we are deeply disturbed that Jordan's economy and
                        prospects for economic self-reliance may be jeopardized by the threat of new
                        defense burdens. </p>
                    <p>2. In this context, we think it is essential to consider the serious
                        repercussions to Jordan's economic development program should the <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> supporting contribution be insufficient to
                        cover all military expansion and supporting costs, or should it suddenly be
                        withdrawn or cut off. </p>
                    <p>3. The US has played a key role in enabling Jordan to develop economically
                        and to contribute to the peace of the Near East. The stability of Jordan as
                        well as the Near East area means a great deal to us. Jordan's plans and what
                        Jordan and the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> are proposing now
                        represents a change in strategy and a potential threat to the stability of
                        the area. This gives us deep concern. </p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">B. Ground Equipment </p>
                    <p>1. With respect to Jordan's ground forces, we appreciate the pressures which
                        are being exerted on Jordan by the <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss>. To
                        the extent that funds for the modernization, expansion, and continued
                        support are available from other sources, we can understand why Jordan
                        wishes to proceed with the <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> program which
                            <persName corresp="#p_KGA2">Khammash</persName> has outlined. </p>
                    <p>2. Recognizing the basic threats to Jordan's sovereignty and economic
                        development inherent in the <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> proposals,
                        we are prepared to assist Jordan in the formulation of long-range plans for
                        equipping and modernizing Jordan's ground forces within its capability to
                        operate, maintain, and support. To this end, if Jordan can obtain adequate
                            <pb n="190" xml:id="pg_190" facs="0222"/>assurance that additional money
                        would be guaranteed by the <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> over a long
                        period for expansion and continued supporting costs and if future Jordanian
                        defense expenditures are held to the current budgetary level, the US is
                        willing to consider selling military ground equipment to Jordan along the
                        general lines of Jordan's shopping list against payments to be received by
                        Jordan from the Unified Arab Command in accordance with the following
                        program: </p>
                    <p>a. We are prepared to proceed immediately to negotiate the sale of a $7
                        million first increment of your total ground force requirements with
                        deliveries of equipment to follow within 12 months of a signed contract.
                        This increment would be directed principally at modernizing or filling
                        equipment requirements for existing forces. Subject to Jordan's ability to
                        secure adequate <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> funds for support and
                        maintenance, we would also be prepared to provide in this increment for
                        partial equipping of one National Guard unit converted to the regular force. </p>
                    <p>b. We are also prepared after negotiating sale of the first increment of $7
                        million to develop plans for sales against cash payments by Jordan of the
                        additional ground equipment contained in Jordan's total ground force
                        requirements. To facilitate planning and deliveries of purchases financed by
                        the <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss>, the US is prepared to consider
                        extension of credit provided that the amount of credit would not exceed $7
                        million at any one time.</p>
                    <p>c. The foregoing arrangements would be conditioned on Jordan holding defense
                        expenditures at the current level of 18.6 million pounds ($51 million) and
                        on Jordan providing through <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss>
                        contributions and/or from adjustments in its own defense budget, adequate
                        funds for maintenance and support of new equipment and additional forces. </p>
                    <p>d. To complement the first tranche of $7 million sales, we also are prepared
                        to continue <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1965 military assistance at
                        the same level as <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1964. As you know, this
                        includes such major items as M–48 tanks and <gloss target="#t_APC1">APC</gloss>'s. </p>
                    <p>e. The long-term program envisaged above should permit a gradual phased
                        expansion of the <gloss target="#t_JAA1">JAA</gloss> which the US would
                        support on an incremental basis, provided <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> funds were forthcoming for materiel and maintenance
                        support. In the event of default by the <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss>
                        in the provision of funds, this program would help minimize adverse effects
                        on Jordan's army and economy—particularly if the bulk of the materiel
                        delivered initially went into Jordan's existing forces. </p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">C. Aircraft </p>
                    <p>We recognize that the Hawker-Hunter will become unsupportable at some point
                        in the future and provision should be made by that time for the introduction
                        of a replacement aircraft into the <gloss target="#t_RJAF1">RJAF</gloss>.
                        Accordingly, we are prepared to consider the problem of replacement of the
                        Hawker-Hunters <pb n="191" xml:id="pg_191" facs="0223"/>by an appropriate
                        aircraft. To ensure that our consideration of replacement aircraft is
                        soundly based—militarily and economically—we propose that a study of
                        Jordan's air requirements, taking into account <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> recommendations, be undertaken in the near future. </p>
                    <p>D. Our Embassy is prepared to discuss the foregoing matters at further length
                        with you and King Hussein in Amman. </p>

                    <p>1. Reference is made to a memorandum by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of
                        Defense (<gloss target="#t_ISA1">ISA</gloss>), I–26001/64, dated 10 July
                            1964,<note n="3" xml:id="d83fn3">Not found. </note> subject as above,
                        which requested comments and reservations on Part I of the third draft of
                        the National Policy Paper on the United Arab Republic (<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>). </p>
                    <p>2. The Joint Chiefs of Staff consider that the draft policy paper provides a
                        generally effective statement of US policy toward the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. However, <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s recent opposition to the US base in Libya, his
                        overt and subversive pressures against the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                        in Aden, his continued intransigence vis-a-vis Israel, are clearly inimical
                        to US interests and objectives. Therefore, provision should be made to
                        permit a firm policy toward the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, as
                        necessary, to protect US interests. At the same time, any “harder” line
                        toward Nasser should be developed with recognition of the possibility that
                        punitive action might place important US interests at risk. </p>
                    <p>3. The Joint Chiefs of Staff consider that the draft paper should give more
                        emphasis to the possibility that war might break out in the Near East within
                        the next several years. It outlines certain conditions <pb n="192" xml:id="pg_192" facs="0224"/>under which Israel might attack; but it
                        does not explain that relatively minor incidents could lead to Arab
                        interference with Israeli activities (i.e., shipping through the Gulf of
                        Aqaba or diversion of Jordan waters) and to Israeli military retaliation. It
                        states that the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> or Israel might pre-empt
                        in the face of a nuclear threat; but it does not explain that the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> could erroneously decide that such a threat
                        exists. Such considerations lead to a dangerous possibility of overt
                        hostilities—with related possibilities of escalation and US involvement. It
                        follows that progress in the settlement of basic <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>-Israeli differences should be attempted with a greater
                        sense of urgency than is reflected in the draft paper. </p>
                    <p>4. While the Joint Chiefs of Staff recognize the complexity of Arab-Israeli
                        problems and the efforts of the United States and the United Nations to
                        resolve such issues, they note that discussions with the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and Israel have usually focused on isolated
                        problems. It is suggested that consideration be given to the initiation of
                        appropriate international negotiations on the complete range of Near East
                        political, economic, and security problems. Such negotiations should take
                        into account the wide-range of US actions and inducements which might be
                        used to encourage constructive solutions. </p>
                    <p>5. Subject to incorporating the views stated above and the specific changes
                        recommended in the Appendix hereto,<note n="4" xml:id="d83fn4">Not printed.
                        </note> the Joint Chiefs of Staff consider that the draft policy paper

                    <p>Following talking points incorporating helpful suggestions contained in
                        Amman's 60: </p>
                    <p>1. <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has tried to be responsive to Jordan
                        arms request. Despite our deep concern over box Jordan may be getting into,
                        package we have developed shows we stand ready to be as helpful as feasible
                        in meeting Jordan's recognized problem. </p>
                    <p>2. US response must be viewed in context of proven long-standing US support
                        of Jordan. Few countries are receiving as much in relation to size as Jordan
                        is from us. <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> support has helped Jordan,
                        perhaps poorest Arab country, to outstrip almost every other in sound
                        economic and social progress. Moreover, firm US position in opposition to
                        aggression against Jordan has protected it against attack. We are sure King
                        in no doubt as to our determination support Jordan's integrity.</p>
                    <p>3. We are not mentioning the above in an effort to evoke gratitude, but to
                        make clear our bona fides as Jordan's largest, most consistent <pb n="194" xml:id="pg_194" facs="0226"/>supporter, which in turn justifies us in
                        asking King to listen most seriously to our counsel.</p>
                    <p>4. While Jordan fully entitled to legitimate self-defense, we fear <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> proposed military buildup going much too
                        far too fast. <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> proposals, if fully
                        carried out, will distort balance heretofore maintained between economic
                        development and military strength. In first place, military strength cannot
                        be built in vacuum. Rather, it flows as natural consequence from
                        strengthening economic and social fabric of society. <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> buildup would mean additional continuing expenses of at
                        least $30 million annually. If <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> funds
                        fail after buildup has been accomplished, where would King get extra funds
                        to support larger military establishment?</p>
                    <p>5. Jordan is even now considering its seven year development plan. This plan
                        reflects our mutual agreement on the desirability and necessity of gradually
                        reducing <gloss target="#t_HKJ1">HKJ</gloss>'s reliance on budget support as
                        such. On the one hand we see no possibility of increasing our budget support
                        to meet the ruinous recurring costs which the <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> plan may involve. On the other we stand fully ready to lend
                        generous support for feasible economic development projects.</p>
                    <p>We sincerely hope King and Jordan will proceed coolly in this situation and
                        avoid being pressured into commitments which could wreck so much of what
                        Jordan and her friends have worked so long and hard to achieve.</p>
                    <p>6. Given absence of <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> funds, plus lack of
                        assurances of continuing maintenance costs, <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> cannot reasonably expect Jordan go further at this time
                        than <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> proposals for buildup. Otherwise,
                            <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> is abdicating sovereignty to <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss>. King needs press this point at September 5
                        Cairo meetings. Package provided <persName corresp="#p_KGA2">Khammash</persName> stands on its own feet.</p>
                    <p>We are not forthcoming on aircraft because in our view these make no
                        economic, political, or military sense for Jordan. Begin <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>. Even Brigadier Khammash admits Jordan does
                        not need supersonic fighters. End <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>. We
                        believe King can argue point at forthcoming Cairo sessions. </p>
                    <p>King must realize <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has its own problems.
                        If Jordanian military establishment becomes distorted out of proportion,
                        Congress may not be willing continue support Jordan so generously as in
                        past. Adverse Congressional reaction would predictably be increased if
                        Jordan accepts Soviet military equipment.</p>
                    <p>We wish HM to know there is no breath of threat contained in foregoing. As
                        good friend we have to make sure he understands our genuine concerns over
                        the threat to US-Jordanian relations bound up in exaggerated military
                        appetites.</p>
                    <p>7. Jordan's concurrence with Arab decision to divert headwaters of Jordan
                        River is not in Jordan's interests. Arab decision to spend vast sums of
                        money on counter-diversion scheme of Jordan River headwaters makes <pb n="195" xml:id="pg_195" facs="0227"/>no sense. Money could much better
                        be spent on constructive projects in Arab countries. Jordan may end up with
                        less water than under Unified Plan, to detriment of its development. (Employ
                        points made in Sections 5 and 6 Reftel.)</p>
                    <p>8. We hope we can continue rely on HM's assurance to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MWBJ1">Macomber</persName> shortly before latter's departure
                        from Jordan that, in Jordan's own interests fundamentals of Jordan's
                        relations with US could not be changed.<note n="5" xml:id="d84fn5">Reference
                            is apparently to <persName corresp="#p_MWBJ1">Macomber</persName>'s
                            farewell conversation with King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> on December 23, 1963. <persName corresp="#p_MWBJ1">Macomber</persName> reported in telegram 296 from
                            Amman, December 24, 1963, that the King “spoke of his determination to
                            continue this forward momentum [of Jordan's economic development] and
                            his appreciation for USG friendship and major contributions to progress
                            which had been achieved.” (National Archives and Records Administration,
                                <gloss target="#t_RG1">RG</gloss> 59, Central Files 1964–66, POL
                            JORDAN) </note> When Amman agreed exchange Ambassadors with Moscow, King
                        made foregoing assurance. In our view old relationship is being threatened.
                        Can King still assure us it is not? <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> cannot believe Soviets have any real regard for him.
                        For example, would he expect Soviet assistance if King were overthrown by
                        internal coup or if Jordan attacked from outside? In our view Soviets are
                        clearly engaged in wrecking expedition. We cannot understand HM's failure
                        perceive this. </p>
                    <p>We do not wish discuss present sincerity of any Arab leaders. We merely hope
                        King will remember the past. How much faith can he put in constancy of other
                        Arab regimes if sudden shift seemed to dictate casting Jordan adrift? As
                        King knows, we have always tried to maintain good relations with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> and have never opposed Arab unity
                        freely achieved. In the past we jointly have considered <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s control over Jordan would be bad
                        for Jordan. We assume King still feels same way.</p>
                    <p>9. So we trust King will keep his head until present situation is clarified.
                        We hope King will agree <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has been
                        understanding and forthcoming in effort to meet his problems. We believe he
                        has enough to seek clarification of overall situation at forthcoming Arab
                        Summit Conference in September. If <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> comes out of September meetings with cash funds for
                        military equipment, and assurances of annual maintenance support for future,
                        which we jointly consider convincing, we will then consult further with the
                        King on steps that appear most likely to advance our mutual interests.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>. As to best time for you approach King,
                        we inclined believe you should not wait until <persName corresp="#p_KGA2">Khammash</persName> has returned to Jordan and reported to King. In

                    </p>
                    <p>Your recent visit to Washington underlined the deep and cordial ties between
                        Jordan and the U.S. For me personally, the visit was an occasion to take
                        stock of the progress that has been achieved in Jordan under your wise
                        leadership and to reaffirm the close relationships between our two
                        countries. I felt your friendship for the US and sensed in turn your
                        appreciation of the factors underlying our policies toward Jordan. I
                        particularly appreciated the truth of your assurances to Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_MWBJ1">Macomber</persName> several months ago that
                        in Jordan's own interest there could be no basic change in our relations
                        growing out of the exchange of Ambassadors between Jordan and the Soviet
                        Union.</p>
                    <p>No one is in a better position than Your Majesty to understand the sincerity
                        of US interest in a fully independent and progressive Jordan. Our support
                        has been proven over time. It is because I know you understand our great
                        stake in Jordan's continued stability and progress that I want to raise with
                        you may concern over recent developments that could adversely affect
                        Jordan's very integrity. We understand your present problem regarding arms
                        for Jordan. We desire to help you face it—sensibly and realistically—in ways
                        which will preserve our happy relationship and not jeopardize your interests
                        or ours.</p>
                    <p>So I have asked Ambassador <persName>Barnes</persName> to review with you my
                        concerns in the fullest confidence and candor. He will speak frankly on my
                        behalf and I shall welcome from Your Majesty a similarly frank and friendly
                        response.</p>

                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s letter carries out his
                        promise to put in writing his oral assurances that the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> will not develop nuclear weapons or
                        introduce them into its defense program. We judge that his response meets
                        our present requirements with respect to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> policy on nuclear weapons.</p>
                    <p>The letter makes two important assertions concerning <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> intent and capability with regard to nuclear weapons: 1)
                            Intent—<persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> personally assures
                        the President that the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> has no thought of
                        bringing the “terrifying danger” of nuclear war into the region. 2)
                        Capability—The letter states the Egyptian people and government “have
                        neither the effort nor the resources to devote to weapons of total
                            destruction.”<note n="3" xml:id="d86fn3">The paragraphs under reference
                            read as follows:</note> The latter clause suffers from the literal
                        translation, which we understand was prepared by the Office of the
                        Presidency in Cairo. As we <pb n="198" xml:id="pg_198" facs="0230"/>and the
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> Embassy interpret the phrase from
                        the Arabic text, which is governing, it says that the Egyptian people and
                        their government are neither endeavoring to develop weapons of mass
                        destruction nor do they have the resources to devote to this purpose.
                        Whether the term “weapons of total destruction” might also cover
                        radiological, bacteriological, and chemical weapons would require further
                        clarification.</p>
                    <p>“In this connection, I assure you that the United Arab Republic, as she
                        resists the possibilities of nuclear war or the impositions of peace through
                        nuclear terror in the entire world, does not think of bringing that
                        terrifying danger to the region she lives in. I believe I hardly need
                        explain the efforts deployed by the United Arab Republic for her
                        development, or the strong and at the same time heroic efforts her people
                        exert to rebuild their life on new bases while faced by the difficulties and
                        obstacles of underdevelopment.</p>
                    <p>“Through these aspirations and the great achievements to which the United
                        Arab Republic people look forward, our people and their Government have
                        neither the effort nor the resources to devote to the weapons of total
                        destruction.”</p>
                    <p>While <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> does not suggest any
                        abandonment of his hostility toward Israel, by implication the letter
                        suggests that Nasser does not intend to resort to nuclear weapons to resolve
                        the Palestine problem. The letter clearly rejects the balance of nuclear
                        terror that exists between the West and the Soviet bloc or the imposition of
                        peace by means of nuclear terror in the entire world. The tone and content
                        on Arab rights in Palestine and the absence of any reference to <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> intentions toward its neighbors suggest
                        that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> probably had in mind
                        possible publication of this letter. He would of course have in mind the
                        probable reaction of other Arab countries that have accused <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> of being soft on Israel. </p>
                    <p>Our favorable assessment of the letter is reinforced by a <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> report that at the recent <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> (Organization of African Unity) meeting in
                        Cairo, the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> introduced a resolution
                        proposing a worldwide agreement by non-nuclear powers not to acquire nuclear
                        weapons. The resolution was put forward to replace a proposed African
                        denuclearization agreement which of course would not have included Israel.
                        It is our understanding that this resolution received the endorsement of the
                            <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> leaders and that they have expressed
                        their willingness to enter into such an agreement. The resolution has not
                        yet been publicly released.<note n="4" xml:id="d86fn4">A copy of the

                    <p>In conclusion, we believe that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s private assurances, coupled with the proposed <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> resolution on nuclear non-acquisition,
                        satisfy our requirements with respect to a written statement of <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> policy on nuclear weapons. The proposed
                        letter from the President expresses appropriate gratification and affirms
                        our understanding of <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s

                    <p>Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> welcomed the Ambassador and asked if he'd care
                        to summarize his discussion with the President.<note n="2" xml:id="d87fn2">
                            <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> met with the President on
                            August 10 from 6:20 to 6:32 p.m. and delivered <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s July 26 letter (see <ref target="#d86">Document 86</ref>). (Johnson Library, President's
                            Daily Diary) The meeting is recorded in a memorandum for the record by
                                <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName>, dated August 11.
                            (Ibid., National Security File, United Arab Republic, <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> Visit, 8/64)</note> Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> did so at some length.
                        Highlights were that:</p>
                    <p>(1) <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> stressed the value of good
                            US/<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> relations, pointing out that US
                        political and economic interests in the Middle East were quite adequately
                        protected as a result of present US policy—not one Middle East country had
                        gone Communist and none were likely to do so; (2) we were managing to keep
                        the Israeli issue in the icebox; (3) the exchange of presidential
                        correspondence was extremely valuable; and (4) <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s latest letter made clear that the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> did not intend to go nuclear. The
                        Ambassador's advice was that the US should now go back to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> with a specific program to build on the
                        nuclear assurances received.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> assured <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> that President Johnson, like President Kennedy, wanted
                        effective communication with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>.
                        Such communication had broken down before 1961, with adverse results to both
                        countries. As a further indication, President Johnson took a direct personal
                        interest in finding a suitable successor to Badeau. In
                            <persName>Bundy</persName>'s opinion he couldn't have found a better
                        man. LUKe <persName corresp="#p_BLD2">Battle</persName>'s appointment would
                        help to keep up the tradition of effective communication which had been
                        built up over the past few years. <persName>Bundy</persName> reiterated the
                        President's great appreciation of <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s nuclear assurances; we would now consider “next
                        steps” as <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> had suggested.</p>
                    <pb n="200" xml:id="pg_200" facs="0232"/>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> remarked that President Johnson
                        had noted the upcoming Arab Summit and neutralist conferences in Cairo and
                        expressed confidence that the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> would play
                        a constructive role in them. He hoped in turn that the US would be
                        forthcoming in its attitude toward these conferences.
                            <persName>Bundy</persName>'s rejoinder was that “conferences are as
                        conferences do.” We had no bias whatsoever against conferences per se, but
                        we naturally hoped they would avoid the pitfalls of bright words and
                        excessive propagandizing. It was a little too much to expect us to be
                        forthcoming in advance, when we didn't know what the participants were going
                        to say. However, <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> could count on
                        us not to bite unless we were bitten.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Bundy</persName> went on to say that the new Administration had
                        tried “ever since we have been here” to develop better relations with the
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. <persName>Bundy</persName> himself
                        was a determined “icebox” man. He felt that for the first 2–1/2 years we had
                        made considerable progress in US/<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                        relations. In the last year, however, there were some signs that the
                        “icebox” policy wasn't quite so cool. The Jordanians, under some pressure
                        from other Arabs, were talking about a new arms buildup. This would
                        inevitably create counter-demands from other quarters. As for the Yemen
                        problem, it was simply not moving very fast. So we saw a number of issues
                        that made it harder for the US and <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> to
                        move closer together.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Bundy</persName> stressed that what concerned us was giving even
                        more concern in the country as a whole and to the Congress in particular,
                        especially in an election year. Not everybody was as sophisticated in their
                        view of US/<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> relations as those who dealt
                        with them regularly. So <persName>Bundy</persName> asked the Ambassador to
                        make sure that these dangers were understood in Cairo. When <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> asked him to be more precise about
                        what dangers, <persName>Bundy</persName> reiterated that they included
                        Yemen, Arab arms, and apparent <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> support
                        for that difficult man Makarios, who was complicating the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>'s task. <persName>Bundy</persName> assured
                            <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> that in dealing with <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> relations, our starting point was respect
                        for Arab purposes and for the central role of the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> in Arab policy. We too would like to see our relations
                        closer and to avoid a drift away from the Kennedy/Johnson policy. </p>
                    <p>In response, <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> urged that we
                        distinguish between long-range matters and those which were non-essential
                        (by implication Yemen and similar problems); the latter should not be
                        permitted to stand in the way of good US/<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                        relations. The important things were that Communists were being kept out of
                        the <gloss target="#t_ME1">ME</gloss>, that Israel was in the “icebox,” and
                        that US oil wasn't being disturbed. <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> then explained at some length his personal role, ever
                        since he had come to the US, in working for good relations. The question as
                        he saw it was how to keep up the momentum achieved over the last few years.
                        For eight months the US hadn't done any real business with the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. He—<persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName>—understood this matter but the “impatient young men”
                        who ran the <pb n="201" xml:id="pg_201" facs="0233"/>government in Cairo
                        were beginning to wonder. The multi-year PL–480 agreement<note n="3" xml:id="d87fn3">Reference is to an agricultural commodities agreement
                            signed at Washington October 8, 1962, covering fiscal years 1963, 1964,
                            and 1965. For text, see 13 <gloss target="#t_UST1">UST</gloss> 2166.
                        </note> had done great things for US/<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                        relations. <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> recommended that we
                        begin negotiations on renewal to show our good intentions. He also stressed
                        the importance of development loans. Cairo kept asking where the $20 million
                        stabilization loan was. Third, <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName>
                        felt it important to encourage US private capital to flow to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. </p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Bundy</persName> felt that the causes of delay on the $20 million
                        loan were not on our side. We had made clear that it could only be given in
                        the environment of three conditions, which would permit us to defend the
                        loan before our own people. He did not believe that the three conditions had
                        been fully met. <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> granted this,
                        but said that Cairo was taking the loan as proof of whether the US would
                        continue its present policy. </p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> then said that the fourth thing
                        he would like to discuss was a consortium to support UAR development. He
                        described how Egyptian development was essential to stability. He had not
                        been asked to raise the consortium question, but felt that such a device
                        would help block extreme socialism or communism in the UAR.
                            <persName>Bundy</persName> regarded the prospects for any consortium as
                        affected by <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> dealings with the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> as a whipping boy. It was hard for the
                        British to join in a consortium when the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                        was causing so much trouble over Aden, for example.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador described the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> problem as “a
                        matter of confidence.” The <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> had no
                        confidence in <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> intentions. The issue now
                        was Yemen. Why couldn't the British accept the <gloss target="#t_YAR1">YAR</gloss>? Then all <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> difficulties would disappear.
                            <persName>Bundy</persName>'s view was that nothing would do more for
                            US/<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> relations than some withdrawals
                        of <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> forces which would establish
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s intent to carry out the
                        disengagement agreement. <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> made a
                        lengthy rejoinder the gist of which was why couldn't the US, after the next
                            <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> election, use its good offices to get
                        British recognition of the <gloss target="#t_YAR1">YAR</gloss>. Present
                        British policy served no useful purpose. In <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName>'s view, US policy toward Yemen was far wiser than that
                        of the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>. <persName>Bundy</persName> granted
                        that it might be difficult to achieve a <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> understanding before
                        October. We had indeed tried several times to bring the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                        together, but neither side seemed inclined to give.</p>
                    <p>Summing up, <persName>Bundy</persName> said he was trying to explain that
                            US/<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> relations must be regarded as a
                        “two-way street.” It was just as important that the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> not give disquieting signals to us as that the US make
                        economic signals to Cairo. <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName>
                        wondered whether the issue over Yemen was “troops or something else.” In
                            <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName>'s view <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> wanted to withdraw troops, but found
                        it very difficult to do so because <pb n="202" xml:id="pg_202" facs="0234"/>of British machinations against the <gloss target="#t_YAR1">YAR</gloss>.
                            <persName>Bundy</persName> thought that it was not just a matter of
                        troop withdrawal per se, but of the damage to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> reputation from having agreed to disengagement and not
                        performing. On Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName>'s suggestion
                        that we were not going to solve the Yemen matter that evening, the meeting
                        broke up amicably.</p>

                        presentation to King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> of
                            <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> position on arms for Jordan which we
                        had all foreseen would be unpleasant to King's ears. While <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>'s over-all reaction negative, we
                        were encouraged by King's apparent recognition of at least some of dangers
                        and disadvantages to Jordan inherent in <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss>
                        arms buildup and by his stated intention postpone any final decisions until
                        over-all situation has been clarified by September Summit Conference. In
                        accordance his request, you should provide King with copy of resume of
                            <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> position on sale of military
                        equipment as contained in Deptel 64 beginning with “A. General” and
                        concluding at the end of paragraph “C. Aircraft.” Paragraph D should not be
                        contained in summary handed to King.</p>
                    <p>In oral presentation to King before handing him summary of <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> position you should stress once again that
                            <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has done more for <pb n="203" xml:id="pg_203" facs="0235"/>Jordan in past and will unquestionably do
                        more in future to preserve basic integrity of Jordan than any other country
                        or group of countries. In light of problems posed for <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> by Jordan's arms request, our response to
                        King cannot be viewed as other than generous. We are glad King apparently
                        sees this with respect to ground equipment, as judged by his remark that our
                        suggestions can probably be drawn up in such priority order as to satisfy
                            <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>We continue to maintain that a supersonic fighter squadron for Jordan makes
                        no military, political or economic sense. In view total number of supersonic
                        fighters at disposal various countries represented on <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss>, we unable understand why supersonic
                        squadron for Jordan could and should have assumed such apparently overriding
                        importance. If <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> had been looking for
                        issue most likely to render permanent damage to US-Jordanian relationship as
                        well as threat to area stability no better could have been found than
                        ordering Jordan to accept supersonic fighter squadron. King says key to
                        present issue is F–104 squadron. This is very issue which faces <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> with such impossible choices.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>'s argument that Israel might
                        well not be upset if Jordan acquired supersonic US squadron may be well
                        taken. However, apart from internal economic effects on Jordan, this misses
                        main point, namely, if <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> provides Jordan
                        with supersonics that symbolize offensive modern military power, little will
                        be left of its Near Eastern arms policy of avoiding becoming major supplier
                        of offensive weapons to countries involved in Arab-Israel context. If we
                        provide supersonics to Jordan, our arguments against providing similar and
                        possibly larger quantities of material to other countries, including Israel
                        and other Arab states, would lose validity. Once embarked on, end of this
                        road would be clear—a polarized situation in Middle East with Arabs lined up
                        with Soviet Union and US in such ill repute in area that King Hussein could
                        no longer afford political liability of being associated with us. We ask the
                        King to search his mind carefully. If he will do so we believe he will see
                        validity of our position.</p>
                    <p>In summary, we see Jordan's acquisition of supersonic fighter planes at this
                        time as beginning of process that may ultimately destroy relations with US.
                        A <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss> squadron for Jordan would be little if
                        any better from our point of view. Congress will simply not understand how
                        Jordan needs such extensive US support if it can afford an expensive
                        supersonic squadron. We think King has good arguments that will make sense
                        to most of other Arab leaders. We hope the King will make these arguments
                        with full force and effect in coming meetings with his fellow Arab leaders.
                        The King must know from past experience that we are with him. We would hope
                        he would remain in close consultation with us and not close any doors at
                        Summit.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">John J. McCloy</persName> has agreed to make
                        another probe of <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s intentions
                        regarding Near East arms limitation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName>'s first probe in June 1963 was followed up by others
                        and eventually resulted in <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s
                        letter of July 26, 1964. In that letter <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> assured you the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                        would not introduce or develop weapons of total destruction. The dialogue
                        begun by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> probably also
                        influenced the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> to introduce the
                        resolution on nuclear non-acquisition at the recent Cairo meeting of the
                        Organization of African Unity. In our view <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s letter together with the <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> resolution satisfy our requirements so far as <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> intentions toward nuclear weapons
                        acquisition are concerned.</p>
                    <p>The purpose of the present probe is to pursue the question of restraining the
                        surface-to-surface missile rivalry between the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and Israel. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName>'s objective is to let <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> know we believe we can convince Israel to exercise
                        nuclear and missile self-denial if <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> will limit his acquisition of major offensive
                        missiles either to the number <pb n="205" xml:id="pg_205" facs="0237"/>he
                        now has or to a low ceiling. He will present specific proposals for an
                        arrangement by which this might be done.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> will see you on August 13
                        for a final briefing. The following are suggested points:</p>
                    <p>1. Thank Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> for undertaking
                        this new mission.</p>
                    <p>2. Request he emphasize to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> that
                        you share President Kennedy's strong desire for peace in the Near East. This
                        is why you have asked him to see <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> again.</p>
                    <p>3. Ask him to deliver your reply to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s letter of July 26 (proposed reply submitted
                            separately)<note n="2" xml:id="d89fn2">
                            <ref target="#d90">Document 90</ref>.</note> and to express personally
                        your gratification for <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s
                        response and your understanding of the commitments he has made.</p>

                    <p>Dear Mr. President:</p>
                    <p>I was most grateful for your letter of July 26, 1964,<note n="2" xml:id="d90fn2">See <ref target="#d86">Document 86</ref>.</note> which
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> delivered to me
                        personally. I place high value on our correspondence and anticipate that it
                        will continue to yield useful results in the future.</p>

                    <p>It is most gratifying to have your personal assurance that the United Arab
                        Republic does not intend to devote its efforts or resources to acquiring
                        weapons of total destruction. Your interest in advancing the well-being of
                        your people and the peace of the world is attested by your statement that
                        the United Arab Republic has no thought of introducing the danger of nuclear
                        conflict into the region of which it is a part.</p>
                    <p>I believe this expression of your views constitutes another significant step
                        in the continuing quest for means of curtailing the nuclear arms race and
                        ensuring the peaceful use of nuclear energy. I am also encouraged by your
                        statements to Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BJS1">Badeau</persName> that you are continuing to give thought to the value
                        of international safeguards in looking ahead to the time when the United
                        Arab Republic may build a nuclear power reactor.</p>
                    <p>Again, let me thank you for your assurances. They give me increased hope that
                        mankind is turning away from the ever-spiraling arms race and toward ever
                        greater reliance on peaceful solutions.</p>

                    <p rend="center">The Problem</p>
                    <p>Jordan has requested that the US sell it some $70–100 million worth of arms.
                        This estimate assesses the consequences and implications of <pb n="207" xml:id="pg_207" facs="0239"/>(a) an outright rejection of this request,
                        (b) full compliance with it, and (c) partial compliance. It also examines
                        briefly three related matters: the prospects for the Arab plan for diversion
                        of the Jordan headwaters, the viability of the United Arab Command (<gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss>), and the anticipated Israeli reactions to
                        this diversion and to the buildup of Arab forces under the <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p rend="center">Conclusions</p>
                    <p>A. Rejection of Hussain's request would cause him to turn to the Egyptians or
                        the Soviets for arms. Although Hussain probably believes that he could take
                        Soviet arms and still get some US economic aid, he would be concerned that
                        US military assistance and budgetary support could well be cut off. If the
                        Egyptians succeeded in sending training missions to Jordan with such
                        materiel, <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s influence in
                        Jordan would be increased and Arab-Israeli tensions would be seriously
                        heightened. (Paras. 7–9)</p>
                    <p>B. US sale of all or most of the requested equipment, while it would lessen
                        Arab resentments concerning alleged US favoritism toward Israel, would
                        impair US ability to check the escalation of the Arab-Israeli arms race.
                        Though Israel would find a large, US-equipped Jordanian army a lesser evil
                        than one equipped with Soviet weapons and under strong Egyptian influence,
                        the Israelis would renew and increase their pressures on the US for more
                        weapons. Any large arms acquisition and expansion of the Jordanian forces
                        would put serious strains on Jordan's economy, since the <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> is unlikely to foot the entire bill.
                        (Paras. 10–12)</p>
                    <p>C. Partial compliance through a US package, of a size governed by <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> willingness to pay, which included some
                        supersonic aircraft and some tanks would probably suffice to prevent the
                        Jordanians from shopping elsewhere and from admitting <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> or Soviet training missions. Hussain would
                        be able at the second round of the Arab Summit Conference to claim that
                        Jordan was doing its share in the buildup against Israel. [<hi rend="italic">2–1/2 lines of source text not declassified</hi>] Nevertheless, partial
                        compliance would have, though to a lesser degree, some of the unfortunate
                        consequences of full compliance. (Paras. 13–15)</p>
                    <p>D. Arab plans to deny portions of the Jordan waters to Israel, even if only
                        partially implemented, would heighten tensions. Israel has said that it
                        would regard diversion by the Arabs of more water than was allotted them
                        under the 1955 proposals as grounds for war. We believe that they would
                        carry out this threat, and that the Arabs, believing it too, are unlikely to
                        test the Israelis until they feel confident that they have become strong
                        enough to provide an effective defense against Israeli attack. (Paras.
                        17–18)</p>
                    <p>E. The <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> goes further than previous efforts
                        to unify Arab military forces, and for the first time money is available to
                        improve the <pb n="208" xml:id="pg_208" facs="0240"/>common military effort.
                        The Arabs estimate that it would take 24 months to create the military
                        capability to repel an Israeli attack, but we believe that it would require
                        three or four years at a minimum. It is too early to say whether the <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> will survive for more than a year or two
                        the strains inherent in the Arab situation. (Paras. 19–22)</p>

                        flight training limited number pilots. This program could start October.</p>
                    <p>We well aware Summit Two conference will be held in heady atmosphere of new
                        spirit of Arab solidarity and that King must not (and does not wish to)
                        appear out of step with that spirit. Nevertheless, we believe we have been
                        forthcoming in our response to King and that in addition he has good
                        argumentation to support delay if he willing use it. We also believe there
                        are other Arab leaders who can understand his position and who will be on
                        side moderation and wisdom.</p>
                    <p>Important point is that King will be able show he has acted on <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> plans and proposals and that we have been
                        forthcoming. He can stress that based on available <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> funds he was able to obtain generous <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> offer of equipment for Jordan ground forces
                        and assurances of US willingness discuss further sales when <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> finances clearer. He can say that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has undertaken begin immediate survey air
                        needs of Jordan including problem of infrastructure and supporting costs. If
                        King pressed by <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> or Summit leaders for
                        details on type and nationality of plane, he should say that much depends on
                        results of survey and on kinds of <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> fund
                        guarantees he able obtain from Summit for both materiel items and
                        maintenance support. (<gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>. If queried by him
                        you may say that US air survey would consider all types US and other Western
                        aircraft. End <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>.) <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> can also say that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> in conjunction <pb n="210" xml:id="pg_210" facs="0242"/>with comprehensive survey of <gloss target="#t_RJAF1">RJAF</gloss> is prepared to initiate advanced flight training in
                        October for limited number of pilots.</p>
                    <p>We believe King should be prepared say to other Arab leaders that although he
                        would have liked fuller and more final answers from US he is encouraged by
                        forthcomingness of US response. We think he could also add that, as Summit
                        leaders aware, he depends on US and other Western sources for nearly
                        one-half Jordan budget. It therefore understandable <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>, which has borne heavy burden support economic development
                        and budget of Jordan for almost decade, would wish examine carefully new
                        pattern of expenditures with widespread implications for Jordan economy. He
                        could say regretfully that this fact of life and that he could not blame
                            <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> for wishing consider carefully what
                        it should do. Finally we see no reason why King could not also say on basis
                        longstanding and fruitful relationship that he is confident fuller and more
                        definite US responses will be forthcoming in due course.</p>
                    <p>King could then take initiative with other Arab leaders to say he would be
                        greatly helped if better guarantees of funds from <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> could be assured. If necessary, he could say he recognized
                        Soviet equipment might be easier obtain without requiring funds in hand.
                        Nevertheless, problem not simply arms and could not be considered in vacuum.
                        He had his whole economy to consider and very viability of Jordan.</p>
                    <p>You should then tell King that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> convinced
                        that King and other Arabs mistaken in believing, as they apparently do, that
                        planned <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> arms buildup can quickly alter
                        Arab-Israeli arms balance. Rather than improving Arab military stance
                        relative to Israel, present <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> pressures
                        will stimulate intensified arms race of self-defeating nature. Not only
                        would Israel be likely continue obtain hardware it needs, but risks of
                        preemptive actions would rise particularly if MIGs introduced into Jordan.
                        Moreover, effects of arms buildup on Arab economics, particularly that of
                        Jordan, could leave them weaker rather than stronger relative to Israel.</p>
                    <p>Finally, acquisition by Jordan now of supersonic squadron bound to increase
                        Israeli pressures for additional arms from <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, France, and especially US, particularly if issue should be
                        forced during US national election period. Results could be contrary to Arab
                        interests, preventing US from continuing its present restrained arms policy,
                        and ultimately leading to polarization with US selling to Israel and Soviets
                        selling to Arabs. This is neither in Arab interest nor ours.</p>
                    <p>We therefore once more urge King not to force supersonics issue at this time,
                        not to take final decisions at Summit Two, and to use the argumentation
                        mentioned in order to show that as Arab leader he is responding to <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> spirit but in wise and statesmanlike
                        manner.</p>

                        other suitable channel:</p>
                    <p>1. Despite formidable obstacles there has been created in Near East a
                        delicate political balance that reduces threat of governmental instability
                        or provocative initiatives and permits states therein to move ahead on
                        urgent business of economic development and social reform.</p>
                    <p>2. <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> feels this balance has been reinforced
                        by: a) Its impartial commitment to prevent aggression by any state in the
                        area; b) Constructive relationship built up in recent years between US and
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, a notable product of which was
                        understanding so far as possible to freeze Palestine issue.</p>
                    <p>3. Prior convocation Second Arab Summit we wish express <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> concerns that developments flowing from
                        first Arab Summit meeting could affect profoundly balance of political and
                        military forces in Near East if they should continue along present
                        course.</p>
                    <p>4. At January Summit meeting, Arab leaders under leadership <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> had wisely decided against war and had made
                        statesmanlike announcements to that effect. Nevertheless some measures
                        decided on in January have developed in such manner as to appear to be
                        leading to greater risk of war and instability in Near East. This seems true
                        particularly with regard to Unified Arab Command.</p>
                    <pb n="213" xml:id="pg_213" facs="0245"/>
                    <p>5. Aside from UAC developments we have also noted various statements about
                        diversion of Jordan waters, excitation of Palestinians through Palestine
                        Entity, and other measures such as proposed Jerusalem radio project.
                        Statements about war with Israel by Arab military spokesmen have been more
                        bellicose since Summit. In addition, in recent days there seems danger in
                        raising expectations of Palestine refugees by making unrealistic demands on
                            <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss> for increased expenditures at
                        time when no further funds forthcoming, costs are rising, and <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss> budget coming up for discussion at

                        especially concerned that funds that might be used to support refugees and
                        promote economic development of Arab countries are instead being diverted to
                        acquisition extensive new armaments under aegis <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>6. <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has recently discussed with Jordan
                        extensive <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss>-sponsored military procurement
                        requests that in our judgment are inconsistent with freeze on Palestine
                        problem, would involve self-defeating drain on funds badly needed for Arab
                        economic development, and could upset Near East political and military
                        balance.</p>
                    <p>7. We have informed <gloss target="#t_HKJ1">HKJ</gloss> we wish to comply
                        with request insofar as our arms policies and economic realities permit. We
                        cannot, however, go so far as to upset stability we have done so much to
                        establish.</p>
                    <p>8. Jordanians have suggested they might have to turn to Soviets if US sales
                        not possible. Jordanian purchase of Bloc weapons would make if difficult if
                        not impossible to convince US electorate of necessity to continue Jordanian
                        “budgetary and other assistance at present level. Pressures to provide
                        compensatory assistance to Israel might also be irresistible. We would see
                        pressures on Jordan to arm too much too fast as upsetting prevailing pattern
                        of military strength and political alignments in Near East.</p>
                    <p>9. We wish to emphasize that the closer the Arabs and Israel come to
                        hostilities, the more remote becomes the prospect of a just solution. We
                        have been gratified by <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> leaders'
                        recognition that Arab-Israel dispute is insoluble by force of arms. While we
                        look confidently to the <gloss target="#t_UARG1">UARG</gloss> to take the
                        lead in dissuading Arab states from aggressive action, we are also deeply
                        concerned that measures taken solely in the name of self-defense not be so
                        precipitate or so extensive as to increase the risk of hostilities or result
                        in a major acceleration of Near East arms race.</p>
                    <p>10. In our efforts to meet Jordanian requests, we have stretched our arms
                        policy to limit. We believe expansion of Jordanian military establishment
                        should be carefully phased over period of several years. We do not want to
                        be forced into hasty decisions on matters with far-reaching implications for
                        US interests in area and for very viability and integrity of Jordan. We hope
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> can understand that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>, which has borne heavy burden support
                        economic development and budget <pb n="214" xml:id="pg_214" facs="0246"/>of
                        Jordan for almost decade, would wish examine carefully new pattern of
                        expenditures with widespread implications for Jordan economy.</p>
                    <p>11. To sum up, <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> hopes Second Arab Summit
                        will not foreclose our efforts to preserve area calm and US-Arab
                        cooperation. We are especially concerned lest <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss>, by forcing disproportionate arms program of unprecedented
                        character, might introduce into tense Near Eastern situation irrevocable new
                        elements with dangerous and unpredictable implications for all governments
                        concerned to say nothing of starting accelerated arms race in Near East. USG
                        counts on <gloss target="#t_UARG1">UARG</gloss>, as leader of Arab opinion,
                        to guide proceedings of Second Arab Summit in statesmanlike and constructive
                        paths.</p>

                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> summarized
                        developments with respect to Israel's acquisition of tanks:</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> had asked for the
                        direct supply of M–48A3 and M–60 tanks and had been told we would consider
                        it. Then the transaction through Germany had come up. Israel had needed 300
                        tanks quickly. The Germans had 232. Israel proposed to take up the slack
                        with Centurions, which it regarded as inferior. By mid-June the German
                        transaction was well underway.</p>
                    <pb n="215" xml:id="pg_215" facs="0247"/>
                    <p>The first shock had come in July; Germany offered only 150 tanks that it
                        proposed to send to Italy. Next, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SFK1">Sloan</persName> had said that the Israeli request for 80 trainees
                        could not be approved on grounds of security and that only if there were no
                        other possibility for training could a small number be considered. Israel
                        had revised its request downward and hoped that it might receive sympathetic
                        consideration. In a letter dated October [September?] 18,<note n="2" xml:id="d95fn2">Not found. </note> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SPOA1">Solbert</persName> had stated there was no possibility of supplying
                        conversion kits and ammunition at excess prices. He had doubts about the
                        wisdom of direct supply of these items to Israel. He indicated the need for
                        a lead time of at least three months in procuring conversion kits. These
                        factors jeopardized the feasibility of the whole project. Delays in
                        procurement meant Israel would not be able to obtain the first tanks until
                        1966 and the last until 1968.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> was deeply
                        concerned and had proposed the following solution to keep the transaction
                        from foundering:</p>
                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Training</hi>: Israel had asked <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> for 26 training slots. This was the limit even of Israel's
                        capability of improvisation. Training courses normally last 12–14 weeks.
                        Israel suggested two successive phases of 13 men each, scattered in three or
                        four different courses. No single course was limited to the M–48A3
                        specifically, so pinpointing would be difficult. There was already an
                        Israeli Lieutenant Colonel in training at Fort Knox, so that the arrival of
                        additional Israeli trainees would create no new precedent. Moreover, Israel
                        was fully cognizant of the need for secrecy and committed to it.</p>
                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Delivery Schedule</hi>: The amount of lead time required
                        by <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> threatened to disrupt Israel's
                        proposed schedule for conversion of tanks. Israel had suggested delivery of
                        50 conversion kits by March 1965, 50 more in September 1965 and the last 50
                        in March of 1966. This would permit delivery of the last tanks to Israel by
                        the end of 1967. Only this or a similar schedule would assure timely
                        deliveries.</p>
                    <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Acquisition of Conversion Kits, Spare Parts, and
                            Ammunition</hi>: When Deputy Defense Minister Peres was in Washington,
                        he had indicated the need to do some work on the tanks in Italy, but the
                        general idea was direct delivery to Israel. Cost would determine the
                        proportion of conversion work to be performed in Italy and Israel. Direct
                        delivery was indispensable to the success of the transaction because a)
                        negotiations with the Italians did not cover purchasing or procurement, only
                        work on the tanks; and b) direct delivery required that only three people in
                        Italy be aware of the transaction, while, if Italy were to engage in
                        procurement, knowledge of the transaction would spread to many <pb n="216" xml:id="pg_216" facs="0248"/>others, including members of the Italian
                        Embassy in Washington. The U.S. had already shipped 500 tank engines (for
                        Sherman M–4's) as well as a number of tank guns directly to Israel. These
                        transactions had remained secret. To refuse direct delivery of conversion
                        kits, spare parts and ammunition would be a retrogression.</p>
                    <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Financial Arrangements</hi>: The cost of tanks would be
                        high, amounting to $30,000 per unit plus large conversion expenses. Israel
                        hoped to cushion the impact of these large expenditures by a) obtaining a
                        mark-down on equipment purchases through classification as excess, b)
                        indirect aid through increases in development loans and PL–480 sales, and c)
                        agreement to provide conversion kits, spare parts and ammunition as
                        non-reimbursable aid. On the basis of quoted prices, Israel estimated that
                        conversion kits and spare parts would amount to $14 million; and ammunition
                        for 300 tanks to about $14.75 million. Since Israel was already listed as a
                        recipient of <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> aid, it would make little
                        political difference whether this aid were in grants or loans. Israel would
                        be unable to handle the tank transaction without such assistance. Despite
                        Israel's apparent prosperity, it had severe economic problems. Israel's
                        foreign debt amounted to about $1 billion, as against foreign exchange
                        reserves of $430 million. Israel hoped last year's level of development
                        loans and PL–480 might be maintained, with increases in development loans to
                        cushion foreign tank purchases. The cost of the whole transaction could be
                        spread over three fiscal years.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary replied: </p>
                    <p>1. <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> hoped to provide an answer to Israel's
                        request for training shortly.2. Delivery of conversion kits by March might
                        be possible but at higher cost. Since the equipment must be manufactured, we
                        could not provide surplus pricing. The need to work overtime to meet
                        Israel's proposed delivery would increase costs. We would try to meet this
                        deadline if Israel considered it important. Meanwhile, we would undertake to
                        obtain firm cost figures.</p>
                    <p>3. Regarding the manner of delivery and its relation to problems of security
                        and use of a cut-out, further talks with <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>
                        would be desirable. We did not know whether this would involve Munitions
                        Control. There seemed some likelihood that MC licenses might be open to
                        public inspection.</p>
                    <p>4. Did we have information on Israel's external defense purchases? A program
                        of Israel's defense buying would be helpful.</p>
                    <p>5. We were considering the determination of the level of development loans,
                        PL–480, and related matters. We hoped to have an answer soon, though certain
                        problems continue to concern us.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> said he had not
                        supplied material on Israel's defense purchases, but could do so. He wished
                        to convey the Prime <pb n="217" xml:id="pg_217" facs="0249"/>Minister's
                        feeling of urgency about the supply of tanks and his worry that it was not
                        moving rapidly. The Prime Minister had said everyone agreed that Israel
                        needed tanks but it seemed impossible to obtain concrete results. Meanwhile,
                        46 tanks had been sent to Jordan. The need to arm in the wake of belligerent
                        statements at the Second Arab Summit Conference increased the economic
                        burden on Israel. The Prime Minister was desperately looking for some way to
                        freeze arms escalation in the Near East and turn the tide of arms
                        acquisition. He hoped there might be some possibility of broaching the
                        subject with the Soviet Union. Also he had heard in the U.S. of a possible
                        approach to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>. Jordan needed no
                        additional arms; <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> was merely
                        responding to pressure from the <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss>.
                        Additional acquisition of arms by Jordan would force Israel to recalculate
                        its arms needs. Finance Minister Saphir had given Mr. Bell a five-year
                        forecast on economic development in Israel. This assumed no absolute
                        increase in arms in the area, which, of course, was not a valid
                        assumption.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> confirmed that
                        acquisition of new tanks by Israel resulted in removal of old tanks from
                        inventory. The first “bite” of 300 replacement tanks would mean the removal
                        of 300 unreconstructed Shermans from Israel's armed forces.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> confirmed that Israel
                        had ordered 250 tanks from the U.K.; 150 by the end of 1966 and the
                        remaining 100 by the end of 1967. Israel was not pleased with Centurions,
                        however, and had hoped to obtain M–60's as the “second bite.”</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> suggested that, if
                        desirable, one of Israel's Deputy Defense Ministers, an expert on tank
                        procurement, could come to Washington to confer with <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>. The visitor could, or course, come to the U.S. indirectly
                        since he was scheduled to visit Canada in the near future. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> agreed to look into this matter with
                        Defense.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary commented on the needlessness of the Near East arms race. A
                        regional approach on arms control at Geneva, however, had met with colossal
                        indifference, despite the presence of a regional representative (Israel).
                        Nasser's position toward this problem was affected by the attitude of the
                        other Arab states. Jordan was indeed under pressure to acquire arms but so
                        far had not reacted. The Soviet track was not promising. It had not proved
                        possible to limit arms control to one or two countries. Inevitably U.S. aid
                        to countries such as Korea and Turkey became involved. We were prepared,
                        however, to give the matter further thought and would discuss it with Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName>, Director of the Arms
                        Control and Disarmament Agency.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary inquired whether Israel was looking into the possibility of
                        developing an anti-tank capability rather than proceeding on the tank vs.
                        tank thesis. Col. Ram Ron noted that all large countries continued <pb n="218" xml:id="pg_218" facs="0250"/>to develop new tanks. Moreover,
                        south Israel was ideal tank country.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary assured Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName>
                        that he would follow up personally on Israel's problems on tank
                        acquisition.</p>

                    <p>In company with Ambassador, called on President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> noon September 28. After presenting him with copy of
                        Warren report<note n="2" xml:id="d96fn2">Reference is to the Report of the
                            President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy
                            (Washington: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1964). <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> was a member of the
                            commission.</note> and talking a little about assassination, in course
                        of which he said it was in his opinion impossible to provide full security
                        and at same time have President perform necessary functions of his office, I
                        told him object of my visit. I stated President Johnson had very strong
                        desire to emphasize to him that he had same interest which President Kennedy
                        had in cordial and well-understood relationship with Egypt as well as in
                        welfare and progress of entire area in which <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> plays such large and vital part. Because of interest and
                        importance President Johnson attaches to this area, he had asked me as same
                        emissary President Kennedy had used, to call upon him in Cairo in order to
                        express the continuity of his interest in the peace and stability of the
                        area.</p>
                    <p>I pointed out it had originally been intended I should call during hiatus
                        between departure of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BJS1">Badeau</persName> and coming of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BLD2">Battle</persName>. He broke in to say he had become very tired during
                        course of summer and what with the preoccupation he had in connection with
                        visits of Chiefs of State and preparation for summit, it had been
                        inconvenient for him to meet with me at that time and that he was glad that
                        I had been able to adjust myself to his convenience.</p>
                    <p>I then recalled to him my last visit which was on the same general subject as
                        that of my present visit. We had the same object in view, namely, to relieve
                        tensions and avoid expenses of unlimited arms race in this area. I pointed
                        out that though he had not felt it was desirable <pb n="219" xml:id="pg_219" facs="0251"/>or practical to enter into any agreement with Israel or
                        indeed with US in connection with any disarmament measures that affected
                        Israel and <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, he had stated he had no
                        intention of introducing nuclear weapons in area nor had he any aggressive
                        designs on any of his neighbors. I stated he had also said if test ban
                        treaty was agreed to between US and Soviet Union, he would endeavor to be
                        among first to ratify it; that he had repeated the above statements and had
                        been among first to ratify test ban treaty, for all of which President
                        Kennedy had been deeply appreciative.</p>
                    <p>Now President Johnson was replying to his letter of July 26, and had asked me
                        to deliver it to him. I handed him letter<note n="3" xml:id="d96fn3">
                            <ref target="#d90">Document 90</ref>. </note> which he took and read
                        without further comment.</p>
                    <p>I told him he could see from contents and tone of letter that President was
                        sincerely anxious to develop possibility of further action in this field of
                        armament and that he continued to wish to find steps which would redound to
                        benefit of all concerned. I dwelt on frustrating aspect of an arms race
                        which no one could expect to win; that counter effort would inevitably be
                        forthcoming from others if he attempted to build up his strength. I stated
                        that we all knew that Israel with assistance of France had been building up
                        missile strength as a counter to what they considered to be Egyptian threat.
                        What President had in mind was, in view of increased expenses and increased
                        dangers of missiles arms race, time had come to level off activities in
                        missile field. What we had in mind involved no formal agreement between
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and Israel or between <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and US. On other hand we did contemplate
                        and suggest independent action on his part, effect of which would be to
                        level off at present state of missile strength. This independent action we
                        suggested could be accompanied by a statement defining his position in this
                        regard. Of course if any action inconsistent with spirit of such commitment
                        on his part was engaged in by any other country in area, he would have full
                        freedom of action restored to him and his commitments would not be binding.
                        US would be prepared to bring its influence on Israel to respond in kind,
                        again without formal agreement but with hoped-for result that badly needed
                        resources could be deflected from purchase of arms to more beneficial
                        purposes and dangers inherent in such arms race avoided.</p>
                    <p>I emphasized he should accept my visit as indication of our own strong
                        interest in area and not as any attempt to advance interests of any
                        particular country. We had heavy investment in area and because of its
                        general strategic importance, both political and military, it was one in
                        whose stability United States as a world leader must be deeply <pb n="220" xml:id="pg_220" facs="0252"/>concerned. This interest was in keeping
                        with persistent and conscious effort on part of US to do all in its power to
                        relieve tensions in sensitive areas in hope of avoiding what otherwise might
                        be a far reaching catastrophe. He seemed to accept our good intentions in
                        this respect and was apparently less suspicious of our motives than he had
                        been at the time of my prior visit. I then gave him our proposals on
                        missiles which were somewhat modified from those that were included in
                        talking papers.<note n="4" xml:id="d96fn4">The talking papers have not been
                            found. Background material relating to <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName>'s mission are in Department of State, <gloss target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss>/IAI Files: Lot 72 D 438, Background

                        read them as well as proposed statement which <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> could make. I then emphasized in reply to his question as
                        to what form assurances would take that they could be either oral or written
                        and that they were designed to avoid any form of inspection which might be
                        invidious to him. I pointed out such information as he might be able to
                        gather in regard to the carrying out of commitments of another country could
                        be supplemented with information of our own.</p>
                    <p>At this point I told him that I was prepared to advise him upon instructions
                        that at present time, Israelis were not possessed of any nuclear weapons nor
                        were they producing any material for such weapons. I stated that this was an
                        indication of our cooperation.</p>
                    <p>After reading proposals on missiles, whose new form follows in separate
                            message,<note n="5" xml:id="d96fn5">See <ref target="#d97">Document
                                97</ref>.</note> he said we must understand that problem in Middle
                        East is not problem of missiles but problem of Palestine. Arabs cannot
                        accept present status in respect to Palestine. There must be solution of
                        Palestine problem based upon justice. Nothing can stop the arms race or
                        change the atmosphere in Middle East except solution of Israeli problem.
                        This is fundamental to everything and it is fatuous to suppose that
                        agreement in respect of missiles or any other incidental issue could solve
                        this fundamental problem. He added that this was a profound political
                        problem and he himself had no solution. Missiles were now very close to the
                        heart of the army. It had no interest in nuclear weapons, but the missiles
                        were a symbol of its renewed strength and confidence. They were a counter to
                        deep reactions suffered in the 1956 invasion. All soldiers wanted all
                        weapons they could get. Whereas our Pentagon might not be involved in
                        political matters, army in Egypt was and it had deep political significance
                        because of its fundamental position in domestic as well as international
                        security of country. Missiles, therefore, carried strong political
                        implications. He had to be frank about this and we had to understand it.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> said that he would give
                        thought to proposals and talk them over with his advisors, but he would have
                        to say he was not optimistic <pb n="221" xml:id="pg_221" facs="0253"/>in
                        regard to an understanding which involved limitations in regard to missiles.
                        When I asked him how long it would take him to give us reaction to
                        proposals, he said about one week. I told him under these circumstances it
                        would be best to leave further discussions on this subject to Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_BLD2">Battle</persName>. However, I wanted to
                        point out that though Palestine might be a fundamental problem in the Middle
                        East, a limitation of arms race was not inconsistent with a recognition of
                        that fact. Indeed, limitation of arms might create an atmosphere in which a
                        better solution might be effected. Because Palestine was difficult and
                        fundamental problem was no reason why one should not attempt moderation of
                        arms race in view of inherent dangers that were involved in such race, and
                        great wastage of resources that could not benefit anyone.</p>
                    <p>It was apparent both to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BLD2">Battle</persName> and to me that he felt he would be faced with a very
                        real political problem if now he attempted to limit production of missiles.
                        It was this rather than any outright hostility on his own part to the
                        proposals which he seemed to stress. Also involved, in our opinion, was his
                        assumed role of leader of Arab world, whose sole binding element is
                        antagonism to Israel. Only unity that existed in Arab world was Palestine
                        issue, and his preoccupation to remain as the influential leader of Arab
                        world precluded any action now which could be interpreted as softness toward
                        Israel. Any weakening of his position toward Israel would impair that
                        leadership and a suggestion that the missile program would be tapered off
                        would be construed by his colleagues as weakening. When I suggested that we
                        had found in our dealings with the Soviet Union that unilateral action of
                        this sort was sometimes productive of improvement in our relationship, he
                        insisted that the parallel between US and Soviet Union and between Israel
                        and <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> was not a good one. Israelis were
                        occupying Palestine, Arab soil. They had invaded and committed aggression
                        against <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. Only parallel would be if
                        Soviet Union were occupying California.</p>
                    <p>It was left that he would carry on discussions with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BLD2">Battle</persName> for moment, that I would not stay to
                        await his reaction, and that if it seemed desirable, I could return to carry
                        on further discussions at a later date. But I think it was clear to both of
                        us that he felt it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to accept
                        proposals. Both of us had impression that he would indeed be involved in
                        heavy political difficulties because of the symbolic character that missiles
                        now occupied in minds of his soldiers and people if he suggested cut back.
                        Moreover, he was fearful of any action that might expose him to charge he
                        was being soft toward Israel in view of his position as leader of Arab
                        world.</p>
                    <p>He was most cordial throughout, recalling number of other occasions we had
                        managed to deal with outstanding issues, and seemed in good health.</p>
                    <pb n="222" xml:id="pg_222" facs="0254"/>
                    <p>As we left, he rather warmly, I felt, requested I pass on his good wishes to
                        President Johnson. </p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: In appraising conversation, we found
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> less flexible on missiles
                        than we had hoped. While tone of conversation may have suggested he could
                        see some advantage in proposals, it was obvious he felt his internal and
                        external political problems were major hindering factors to any action he
                        could take. At this point my view which <persName corresp="#p_BLD2">Battle</persName> shares is that it is important keep the dialogue
                        going and hopefully not to have direct turndown for fear ending what has
                        thus far been useful discussion with possible side effects of bringing about
                        exactly what we attempting avoid, acceleration rather than moderation of
                        arms race this area. Our guess is that <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                        will not give us early answer and may delay giving us any final response,
                        which may be preferable to direct turndown if we press too hard at this
                        point.</p>

                    <p>Following are verbatim texts of two papers given President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> September 28 during <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> visit:</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Proposal for Missiles:</p>
                    <p>1. Private assurances, written or oral, would be provided that large
                        land-based surface-to-surface missiles would not be deployed either through
                        the use of mobile launchers or the construction of permanent launching
                        facilities for this purpose.</p>
                    <p>2. Assurances would also be given that procurement or production of large
                        surface-to-surface missiles for military purposes would be held to present
                        levels. As it is understood that the number of missiles that are now
                        available is limited, there would be no question of destroying any existing
                        capacity.</p>
                    <p>3. Any space research programs would be conducted openly and in a manner
                        consistent with furthering international scientific cooperation. <pb n="223" xml:id="pg_223" facs="0255"/>Any production of rockets for use in such
                        programs would be limited to the numbers required for planned
                        launchings.</p>
                    <p>4. With respect to production or acquisition of missiles, the type of
                        assurances that might be given to create confidence that the above
                        commitments were being carried out would be left for further discussion. It
                        is believed this could be done without the introduction of any type of
                        inspection system which would be considered invidious to the countries
                        concerned.</p>
                    <p>5. With respect to deployment, information which the countries accepting this
                        arrangement would seek to obtain through their own resources could be
                        supplemented by such information as may become available to a third country
                        which would be aware of the arrangement.</p>
                    <p>6. If any country in the area should take any action inconsistent with the
                        above, this commitment and related assurances would not be binding.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Proposed written statement: </p>
                    <p>The United Arab Republic wishes to provide assurances that its efforts to
                        develop surface-to-surface missiles have been undertaken only for the
                        purposes of self-defense. As a result of its missile development program,
                        the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> is now in a position to create a
                        large missile force should it be necessary. It will be appreciated that the
                        question whether the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> should decide such
                        a force is necessary for its national defense will be strongly affected by
                        the course others in the area may follow. In the long run, the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> hopes that the real value of the missiles
                        it has developed will be for the role they can play in furthering man's
                        knowledge of outer space.</p>

                    <p>After summarizing briefly the high points of his meeting with President
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> on September 28, Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> said he had found
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> this time to be less
                        suspicious and more willing to talk about the arms problem than when the
                        subject had first been raised in June 1963. While <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> gave no indication that he would be
                        able to do anything about keeping his missile strength at present levels, he
                        did not reject our proposal. He was frank in pointing out the political
                        problems, both internal and external, which he faced if he should take any
                        action which could be interpreted as softness toward Israel. Asked if he
                        gave any hint on the number of missiles he had, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> said he had not asked the question.
                        However, <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> had reiterated that
                        he had started missile development because he could not rely on the Soviet
                        Union for his full arsenal.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> was not optimistic that
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> could conform to the kind
                        of proposal we had presented not to increase the present number of
                        surface-to-surface missiles. We were asking him something that was very hard
                        for him to do. Yet, there was a dividend for us in trying to maintain the
                        arms dialogue with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>. If we kept
                        working on <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, we might
                        eventually get some results. He hoped Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BLD2">Battle</persName> would have an opportunity to review his meeting with
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> whenever it was
                        practical.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> then noted that when he
                        conveyed our assurances on Dimona, <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> made no comment. He assumed this meant that this
                        information confirmed other <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> intelligence
                        on the subject. He also thought it significant that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> did not mention pre-emptive war to
                        him during this visit—as he did in the last—in the event Israel obtained
                        nuclear capability. Also interesting was <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s lack of reaction to information that Israel was
                        going in for its own <gloss target="#t_SSM1">SSM</gloss>'s. There seemed to
                        be an almost casual acceptance of this development.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> commented, in
                        reading Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName>'s report, that
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> had held out little
                        encouragement for accepting the present status quo in the Near East. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> said <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> had argued that a solution of the
                        Palestine problem based on justice was fundamental. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> had volunteered that he himself had
                        no solution. This seemed to imply that war was not a feasible way to resolve
                        the problem. It also seemed to imply that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> did not feel he was strong enough with other Arabs to
                        take any statesmanlike actions on this issue.</p>
                    <pb n="225" xml:id="pg_225" facs="0257"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> mentioned that his visit
                        had come to the attention of the Cairo press because his name had been
                        listed on <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s register of
                        visitors. He asked how he should respond in case any questions were raised.
                        He noted parenthetically that Joux (sic) in the Quai d'Orsay had noticed his
                        visit with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> as had Eric Warburg
                        at the Council of Foreign Relations in New York. He had told them that he
                        had gone to review several matters in connection with his business
                        interests. Since the President knew of his friendship with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, he had been asked to reiterate our
                        interest in developments in the Near East and the need to tamp down tensions
                        created by the arms race. Mr. Warburg had told Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> that he thought this was a good
                        development and hoped these efforts would continue.</p>
                    <p>It was agreed that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> should
                        respond along these lines in case questions were raised again by responsible
                        private individuals. Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> suggested that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> might usefully point out at the same time why it was
                        desirable for the U.S. to maintain a dialogue with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>. The Governor then expressed his
                        concern over recent statements by Senator Keating and Congressman Taft
                        urging the Administration to submit an ultimatum to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> or otherwise stop all assistance. He
                        instructed <gloss target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss> to prepare a telegram to
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Barbour</persName> in which the
                        Ambassador would convey to Premier Eshkol the general tenor, but without the
                        specifics, of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName>'s meeting
                        with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> and point to the utility
                        of maintaining a dialogue. Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> thought that after the elections, the Department
                        would have a job to try to get the Israeli Government to get its supporters
                        to think of the long-range aspects of our policy and understand why it was
                        desirable for us to continue frank discussions with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>. He thought Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> might play a useful role in this
                        connection.</p>
                    <p>At the close of the meeting, there was a brief discussion of the Chase
                        boycott problem<note n="2" xml:id="d98fn2">The Arab Central Boycott Office
                            in Damascus had announced the blacklisting of Chase Manhattan Bank on
                            July 9 and had given the bank 6 months to liquidate its affairs in Arab
                            countries. <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> raised this
                            with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> on September 28,
                            noting it as an example of the desirability of avoiding any action that
                            might irritate U.S.-<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> relations, and
                            discussed it with Hassouna and <persName corresp="#p_KAM2">Kaissouni</persName> on September 29. (Telegram 1078 from Cairo,

                        <hi rend="italic">Aid to Israel</hi>. Attached are Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>'s recommendations on <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1965 aid and various aspects of the tank
                        deal. By wrapping all these up in one package, we can use the plus items to
                        offset those where we simply have to say no.</p>
                    <p>Thanks to our help, the Israelis have done quite well on tanks. They will get
                        not only 150 German M–48s, with an option on 82 more, but some 250 <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> Centurions. The prices are better than we
                        could have given. While the grand total may run over $70 million, it is now
                        for many more tanks (482) than the 2–300 we were talking about earlier.
                        We'll help out on training and delivery, and give the same good terms as on
                        Hawk (10 years, 10% down payment, 3–1/2% interest) for the modernization
                        kits and ammunition we've agreed to sell directly for $24 million or so.</p>
                    <p>Though pleased with the overall deal, the Israelis have hoped to shave this
                        US price. They've suggested a number of ingenious ways, but <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> and State reject these as infeasible or
                        highly risky. Nor, as <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> says, do we
                        have any commitment to go even further in helping out on tanks.</p>
                    <p>If we want to help Israel on political and defense burden grounds, the
                        sensible way to do so is via an indirect subsidy through PL 480 and economic
                        aid (as we've done in past years). Dave Bell points out that Israel hardly
                        qualifies for DL on any economic criteria, but this is still the safest
                        way.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">So we recommend</hi> that you approve <gloss target="#t_DL1">DL</gloss> to Israel at the same $20 <hi rend="italic">million</hi> level as last year (the high side of the range proposed by
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>), and Title I PL 480 of at
                        least $34 <hi rend="italic">million</hi>, which Agriculture believes can be
                        managed. There is pressure for moving Israel at least partly into Title IV
                        this year, but we propose leaving this to negotiation with the Israelis.</p>
                    <pb n="227" xml:id="pg_227" facs="0259"/>
                    <p>Together with the generous tank credit terms, this would add up in effect to
                        a somewhat higher aid level than last year. While it naturally falls short
                        of Israeli desires, we think they'll be satisfied. We must also keep in mind
                        that nuclear desalting may cost us a lot in future years. If you approve
                        this general aid level, we'd like to put out the word quietly right
                            now.<note n="2" xml:id="d99fn2">The President initialed his

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">We have come under considerable Israeli pressure to button
                            up various subsidiary aspects of the tank matter and to decide on our
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>-1965 aid level</hi>—in the last
                        analysis a political decision. I believe that we would do best by handling
                        all these matters as a single package, so that the favorable items can
                        offset those where we must be negative.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Israel has done well on its German and U.K. tank
                            purchases</hi>, largely owing to your intervention with Erhard. It is
                        going to get 150 M–48A1 tanks from West Germany in an “as is” condition at a
                        somewhat better price than we could have offered for the same tanks. We will
                        sell kits to modernize the M–48's and provide necessary training, ammunition
                        and support spares. We also found to our surprise that after all Israel's
                        pleas that the U.K. Centurion was no good, it has now signed up for some
                        250. <hi rend="italic">So Israel will get 400 tanks over the next few years,
                            and the prices for the basic tanks will be fully comparable to what we
                            could offer</hi>.</p>
                    <p>Alleging both economic need and a need for indirect defense subsidy, Israel
                        has requested $29.5 million in Development Loans and $38.5 <pb n="228" xml:id="pg_228" facs="0260"/>million in Title I PL–480, (including $17
                        million already available for 1965). This is a total of $68 million for
                            <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>-1965 compared to $20 million
                        Development Loans and $28 million PL–480 last year, or a total of $48
                        million. Given Israel's continued remarkable economic growth and rising
                        reserves, Dave Bell sees <del rend="strikethrough">no economic justification
                            whatsoever for any Development Loans</del> (which AID in its
                        presentation to Congress estimated as $0 to $10 million, as compared to $20
                        million <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>-1964). Since the U.K. and German
                        prices are most reasonable, <hi rend="italic">we do not have a commitment to
                            help out indirectly on the tank deal</hi>. Although Prime Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> may have the impression
                        from the conversations in Washington that we intended to be of financial as
                        well as other assistance, the record shows that the only concrete suggestion
                        we made was that we would consider such help if the European tanks turned
                        out to be substantially more expensive than those from the United
                        States.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendation: </p>
                    <p>Balancing off the many factors involved, I recommend that you approve the
                        following proposals:</p>
                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic"> PL–480: Meet the Israeli request with a program</hi> of
                        approximately $21.5 million which, added to the amount of $17 million
                        already available for 1965 in the current agreement, comes to a total of
                        $38.5. This could be on the same terms as last year taking account of
                        changes in PL–480 legislation and the need to maintain usual marketings,
                        except that $7 to $10 million worth would be repayable in dollars rather
                        than local currency, but this amount would not necessarily represent sales
                        of beef. The dollar sales would be included in order to establish the
                        principle that the time has come for Israel to move to a Title IV
                        program.</p>
                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Development Loans</hi>: Though Dave Bell sees no case
                        based on economic aid criteria, <hi rend="italic">there are valid reasons
                            for Development Loans in the range of $10–$20 million</hi> on the same
                        terms as last year. Request you indicate the amount you approve.</p>
                    <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Helping Israel get Tanks</hi>: On top of our all-out
                        efforts to date: (a) we have speeded up the flow of U.S. replacement tanks
                        to Germany so the others can be released; (b) we have provided technical
                        data requested by the Israelis; and (c) as an added concession, <hi rend="italic">
                            <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> proposes to give Israel favorable
                                <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> credit terms similar to those on
                            Hawks (10 years at 3–1/2% with only 10% down payment) for the
                            modernization kits, spares and ammunition which must be purchased from
                            us</hi>. As yet we do not have firm dates when the Italians need to have
                        the overhaul and conversion kits on hand. <hi rend="italic">Through the use
                            of overtime, <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> can probably deliver
                            the necessary overhaul and conversions kits to Italy on a schedule
                            dovetailed with the arrival of M–48's from West Germany</hi>.</p>
                    <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Sale of Kits and Conversion</hi>: During Prime Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>'s June visit we were given
                        to understand that, in the interests of secrecy, <pb n="229" xml:id="pg_229" facs="0261"/>M–48's obtained from West Germany would be overhauled and
                        fitted in Italy with diesel engines and large guns. It was also contemplated
                        that the sale of the U.S. conversion kits would be through a third country.
                        The Israelis are now urging that sale of the kits be made directly to Israel
                        and that some or all of the conversion be undertaken in Israel. They contend
                        that this procedure will be more secure. We should be openminded on this and
                        hear them out, but accede to the Israeli suggestions only if we are
                        satisfied that they do provide adequate security from the U.S. point of
                        view.</p>
                    <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Tank Training</hi>: The Israelis originally wanted to
                        have almost 100 people trained in the U.S. For obvious security reasons, we
                        got them to cut this to 26 plus visits by a few engineers to study
                        conversion techniques. We think we can handle all of these visitors if
                        properly spaced.</p>
                    <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Surplus Prices</hi>: The Israelis have urged that we
                        provide our tank kits and ammunition at “surplus” prices, to save them
                        money. <hi rend="italic">
                            <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> says it simply cannot do so, because
                            practically all is new output</hi>. The kits represent special orders;
                        the ammunition is going currently to U.S. forces.<note n="5" xml:id="d99fn5">There is no indication of the President's approval or disapproval of
                            the recommendations.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>While the above does not meet all Israeli requests, it adds up to a generous
                        package, which should relieve any pre-election pressure on us. If you
                        approve, I propose to communicate these decisions to the Israelis
                            shortly.<note n="6" xml:id="d99fn6">A November 15 exchange of letters

                    <p>The President has received a very private and informal approach from Prime
                        Minister <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>
                        <note n="2" xml:id="d101fn2">The message was conveyed in a memorandum of
                            October 19 from Feldman to the President. (Ibid.)</note> on delaying our
                        next inspection of the Dimona reactor, for which we are currently pressing.
                            <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> recognizes Israel has
                        committed itself to periodic inspection of Dimona, though apparently on an
                        annual rather than semi-annual basis.</p>
                    <p>However, he has personally appealed for deferring this inspection until after
                        his elections in November 1965. He is concerned about charges that he has
                        opened Israel's reactor to inspection by other powers, and contends that if
                        he is compelled to honor his agreement it will jeopardize his political
                        position. <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> further points out
                        that there is no possibility that Dimona could be converted to military
                        purposes in so short a period of time.</p>
                    <p>The President would appreciate your recommendations. However, he would not
                        want to decide so sensitive a matter until after our elections, which gives
                        time for us to investigate the full implications of a delay en route. In the
                        meantime I suggest that we postpone any further diplomatic approaches in
                        Israel. May I also suggest that we ask <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">John
                            McCone</persName> for an evaluation of the possible risks in an
                        inspection gap which might be as much as two years.</p>

                    <p>Dear Phil: </p>
                    <p>I did not want to let Ridge Knight's letter and memorandum of October 16<note n="2" xml:id="d102fn2">
                            <persName corresp="#p_KRB1">Knight</persName>'s October 16 memorandum on
                            the subject “Syrian-Israeli Confrontation in the Demilitarized Zones,”
                            attached to a letter to <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> of
                            the same date, argued that Israel was “seeking with unflinching
                            persistence and tenacity to extend its sovereignty to the demilitarized
                            zones” and that the United States was constantly trying to restrain Arab
                            reactions against Israeli actions and was consequently too bogged down
                            in details to do all that it could to restrain Israel. (Ibid.)</note> go
                        by without some comment.</p>
                    <p>I think Ridge's basic thesis is right. The United States is apparently a
                        helpless witness to Israel's inexorable drive not only to gain full
                        sovereignty over the demilitarized zones but to “remilitarize” them.
                        Therefore we get bogged down in details—“Black lines,” “Brown lines,”
                        etc.—and end up assisting the Israelis in a process which is a clear
                        violation of the letter and spirit of the Armistice Agreement and of the
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter. What should add to the
                        Syrians' apprehensions re Israel intentions and latent U.S. support for them
                        is the fact that the Israelis in 1955 possessed themselves of the Nitzana
                        demilitarized zone on the Egyptian-Israel armistice line and now operate
                        that region in fee simple with none to protest the presence of Israel armed
                        forces there.</p>
                    <p>We are unable to persuade Israel to return to the Israel-Syrian Mixed
                        Armistice Commission so we get directly involved in the details of General
                        Odd Bull's informal negotiations with the parties. We have been unable to
                        persuade the Israelis to withdraw their unilateral denunciation of the
                        Egyptian-Israel Armistice Agreement so we involve ourselves in the details
                        of financing and administering the United Nations Emergency Force.</p>
                    <p>We are unable to formalize the international community's very real interest
                        in Jerusalem. Under Israeli pressure, we have now removed the designation
                        “Jerusalem, Palestine” from our directories. Maybe this was the right thing
                        to do. Maybe Jerusalem will just disappear. Maybe the next change in the
                        Foreign Service List will be to call Israel-occupied Jerusalem “East Tel
                        Aviv.”</p>
                    <pb n="232" xml:id="pg_232" facs="0264"/>
                    <p>We are unable to obtain Israel compliance with <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolutions calling for the repatriation and compensation of
                        the refugees. Therefore we natter at <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss>
                        to prune its lists and cut expenses and keep reminding the Arab host
                        governments that it is American bounty that keeps the unfortunate refugees
                        alive.</p>
                    <p>The above picture is not very pleasant. It is compounded by the fact that
                        Israel and its friends in the United States have been able to establish
                        widespread credence in an upside-down world where Syria is the trigger happy
                        party in the demilitarized zones, <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> is dedicated to the destruction of “peace-loving”
                        Israel, and the plight of the Arab refugees is somehow the fault of the Arab
                        host governments.</p>
                    <p>All the above is said neither in sorrow nor in anger. I don't think it is
                        realistic to expect the United States suddenly after sixteen years to gain
                        the capability to reverse any of these situations. To the contrary, I think
                        we should probably take some pride in that despite these handicaps we have
                        not only kept the peace in this area but have also managed to contain Soviet
                        influence and to pump out nearly a billion dollars a year in petroleum
                        revenues.</p>
                    <p>I do, however, go along with Ridge's thought that our preoccupation with
                        trees often obscures the forest. The fact is that Israel's interests (as
                        determined by Israel) do not at all times and in all respects coincide with
                        those of the United States. This is neither abnormal nor wicked. Perhaps we
                        should strengthen our efforts to bring this fact to the attention of
                        Americans. It was Thomas Jefferson, I believe, who in a little document
                        proclaimed on July 4, 1776 said something like this: “Let facts be submitted
                        to a candid world.”</p>
                    <p>How do we do this? A number of suggestions come to mind. Perhaps some
                        well-known journalists could be persuaded that there is a story behind some
                        of the aspects of the Palestine problem and UN and other efforts to keep the
                        peace. Rick Smith, the Cairo correspondent of <hi rend="italic">The New York
                            Times</hi>, tells us he has been commissioned to write a piece for the
                        Sunday Magazine about the Palestine refugees to be run at about the time the
                            <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss> debate takes place in New York.
                        We intend to give him every assistance. Perhaps other American
                        correspondents in the area or in Washington would be interested in writing
                        pieces about the demilitarized zones, the operations of <gloss target="#t_UNTSO1">UNTSO</gloss> and the Mixed Armistice Commissions,
                        etc. More importantly, however, it seems to me that it would be useful if
                        some leading American legislators from states where there is little
                        involvement in the Arab-Israel dispute were to take an interest in the
                        Palestine situation and make speeches about the issues and their effect on
                        the totality of U.S. interests in this area. Candidates for this type of
                        exercise who come quickly to mind are Senators Fulbright, Church, and
                        Monroney.</p>

                    <p>The Arab-Israel area has been relatively free over the past few years of
                        clashes and incidents of the magnitude which grab headlines on a continuing
                        basis at home. This is, of course, a good thing as it demonstrates the
                        effectiveness of our policies. At the same time it has meant that the field
                        has been left fairly clear for special pleaders. This, I think, we should
                        try to remedy.</p>

                        concern that presenting Egyptians with alternatives to commodity loan might
                        be regarded as attempt to renege on an agreement whose requirements they
                        feel have been met. Agreeing with Embassy position that continued inaction
                        in field of economic cooperation could bring an end to our policy of seeking
                        to broaden areas of common interest with the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and recognizing practical difficulty if not impossibility
                        moving forward on commodity loan, we have sought to provide another basis
                        for moving ahead. The State/AID proposals carried by <persName corresp="#p_MWBJ1">Macomber</persName> supplemented by Aidto 198<note n="3" xml:id="d105fn3">Not found.</note> we believe can be presented as
                        an economically useful token of US intent to carry forward on current
                        policies.</p>
                    <p>Commodity loan is hamstrung by our inability to demonstrate to Congressional
                        and other inquirers' complete satisfaction second requirement or evidence
                        that U.S. aid does not in fact pay part of foreign exchange costs of a
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> “occupation” of Yemen. We can hardly
                        claim progress on third condition, given presence over 50,000 Egyptian
                        troops in Yemen (latest intelligence community estimate) as against less
                        than 30,000 when Yemen costs discussed with <persName corresp="#p_KAM2">Kaissouni</persName> in October, 1963. While <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>-Saudi detente on Yemen hopeful, know from our experiences
                        through 1963 the danger of claiming “major progress” on <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                        <pb n="236" xml:id="pg_236" facs="0268"/>performance until actual and
                        substantial drawdown takes place. If the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                        should opt for the $20 million program loan, they must understand that we
                        cannot proceed until Egyptian performance permits us to defend the loan
                        against domestic criticism.</p>
                    <p>This being the case, we propose moving forward by offering an alternative
                        which we believe could be presented to Egyptians as more advantageous and
                        more immediately available. We note that, since our agreement in principle
                        supply $20 million to help meet chronic foreign currency shortage, Kuwaiti
                        loan of over $90 million has been received. Any current balance of payments
                        strains for which <gloss target="#t_UARG1">UARG</gloss> had earmarked
                        commodity loan can be covered to some extent by at least part of increases
                        in the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 65 Title I program requested by
                            <gloss target="#t_UARG1">UARG</gloss> over that remaining in the present
                        multiyear agreement. The sector loan-project loan package added to this
                        should serve as adequate symbol of US intent to restore aid momentum.</p>
                    <p>Neither we nor the Egyptians should labor under illusion that program (i.e.,
                        commodity) or project loan for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 65 is major
                        benchmark passing of which will ensure smoothing of course of future
                        assistance. PL 480 agreement which is core of our economic cooperation
                        program remains to be negotiated for years subsequent to '65. Our
                        flexibility in this and working toward a future Western approach to counter
                        Soviet influence will to a large degree be dependent on Egyptian action in
                        meeting its commitments under present PL 480 agreement, in managing its
                        economy, and on Egypt's political posture in the area and on the world
                        scene. We are gratified by recent reports that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> and his key lieutenants are giving <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> economic problems their personal attention.
                        Strong argument can be made we should not come between them and their
                        decision to face and reappraise unpleasant economic realities. They know
                        from qualified foreign economists what needs to be done. Their willingness
                        take bitter medicine necessarily will be one of principal determining
                        factors in future US–<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> economic
                        cooperation.</p>

                        problem for time being, and hope to steer <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss> item through <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> with no
                        change for worse in basic elements of overall Arab-Israel conflict over
                        refugees.</p>
                    <p>We intend maintain to maximum degree “even-handed” position which will resist
                        all proposals designed to tip balance in favor of one side or other. This
                        policy should give us maximum leverage to obtain our objectives, and produce
                        middle-of-road res acceptable to all. With <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss> up for extension this year, we have increased capability
                        for keeping problem within tolerable limits.</p>
                    <p>Some new elements have entered picture. Cairo non-aligned conf declaration
                        included statement endorsing “rights of Palestinians to homeland” and Arab
                        League has endorsed new and stronger refugee organization called “Palestine
                        Liberation Organization.” We do not know that either of these factors will
                        have any strong influence at <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss>, but we
                        must be ready in event Arabs decide to press forward for additional <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> backing for refugee cause in Palestine. On
                        other hand, in keeping with even-handed position, we must be alert for
                        Israeli efforts to ram through partisan resolution.</p>
                    <p>As usual both sides are expected to open early campaign at <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and in capitals throughout world to gain
                        adherents in this annual contest. Palestine Liberation Organization is
                        making plans to send special missions to various govts to seek support for
                        Arab objectives; Israelis are planning counter offensive.</p>
                    <p>Many governments will look to US for lead. In your discussions this subject,
                        you may be guided by following: </p>
                    <p>1. <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> favors even-handed res along lines
                        last year's. It would extend <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss> for
                        perhaps two years. Exact length of time to be left open for time being.</p>
                    <p>2. We continue oppose Arab proposals for <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                        custodian for Arab properties in Israel. We will also strongly oppose any
                        Arab attempt gain <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> endorsement of
                        non-aligned conf declaration on Palestinian <pb n="238" xml:id="pg_238" facs="0270"/>rights, or to win <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>
                        recognition of Palestine Liberation Organization as official representatives
                        of Arab refugees.</p>
                    <p>This connection, if govt to which you accredited asks US attitude toward any
                        special missions by <gloss target="#t_PLO1">PLO</gloss>, you should state
                            <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> does not recognize it as official
                        reps of refugees at <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss>, and we would be
                        concerned at any effort by <gloss target="#t_PLO1">PLO</gloss> to convert
                            <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss> item (essentially a humanitarian
                        issue) into political problem (Arabs' anti-Israel objectives). If <gloss target="#t_PLO1">PLO</gloss> missions ask to see Emboffs we prefer
                        Embassies decline. We do not, however, believe <gloss target="#t_PLO1">PLO</gloss> missions likely be very effective.</p>
                    <p>(We have informed Israeli officials we will brief our Embassies on <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> substantive position on <gloss target="#t_PLO1">PLO</gloss> and authorize them to give our position
                        clearly and forthrightly to any government which asked our judgment on this
                        matter. We declined however to take initiative since any approach by <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> could raise allegations of “imperialist”
                        pressure and befog substantive issue in manner which might help <gloss target="#t_PLO1">PLO</gloss>. We also said we could not tell other govts

                    <p>105. Chase Manhattan. Since ConGen will be responsible for reporting on
                        forthcoming Bahrain Boycott Conference, and to ensure you informed,
                        following background information transmitted:</p>
                    <p>Arab Central Boycott Office Damascus announced July 9 blacklisting Chase
                        Manhattan for “violation principles of boycott and for being agent Israeli
                        bonds.” Bank given six months to liquidate affairs in Arab countries.
                        Department's assistance sought and matter has been receiving continuing
                        attention in highest levels Department to ensure boycott recommendation
                        rescinded in Bahrain Conference. Various Arab ambassadors called in and
                        informed we view matter with great concern and fear consequences in Congress
                        and elsewhere should boycott not be rescinded. Our own ambassadors in Arab
                        countries have made representations to governments to which they accredited
                        taking same line.</p>
                    <p>Bank has only acted as fiscal agent for Israeli bonds held by investors in

                        principal and interest. Concerning Arab charges Chase extended loan to El
                        Al, Chase discounted commercial paper arising out of sale of Boeing jets
                        under Exim guaranties. Chase has endeavored satisfy Arab countries by
                        furnishing affidavits and letters to individual Arab countries and by
                        personal contacts. Chase received no formal notification from Boycott Office
                        and has no communication with Central Boycott Office or boycott offices of
                        any Arab country.</p>
                    <p>Most Arab countries appear oppose implementation boycott but unable take lead
                        for variety reasons. We recognize lead must come from Cairo and have made

                    <p>Given the Congressional and other criticism of aid to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, I think it would be desirable to let the
                        President review our policy on this matter before any new decisions are
                        taken. I don't mean to suggest that he is dissatisfied with existing policy,
                        but merely that he should be fully apprised of the case for any new aid
                        measures, particularly since they entail potential domestic reactions.</p>
                    <p>So I suggest that you provide him in due course with your recommendations on
                        proposed <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1965–66 US aid, including PL 480,
                        together with an analysis of what we expect to gain from such aid and what
                        leverage it provides us. It might also be useful to discuss what other
                        alternatives are open to us. Mid-December would be a good target date.</p>

                                2, Document 101</ref>.</note> you should make following points to
                            <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> privately, indicating that
                        you are speaking on Presidential authority:</p>
                    <p>1. President appreciates the frankness of <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>'s informal message outlining the problems posed for
                        him by the timing of our next visit to the Dimona reactor. We can of course
                        understand the ever present difficulty of reconciling conflicting domestic
                        and foreign interests.</p>
                    <p>2. Nevertheless, President does feel bound to urge the importance of the
                        semi-annual visits on which we have previously agreed. We are engaged in a
                        continuing effort to prevent proliferation of sophisticated weapons, not
                        least in the Near East. We believe <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> fully agrees that this effort is in the interests of
                        Israel. A vital element in its success is our ability to assure all parties
                        that none of them has attained or is seeking a nuclear capability, and to
                        give this assurance we must be able to satisfy ourselves on this score.</p>
                    <p>3. The problem is made more acute by the recent explosion of a nuclear device
                        by Communist China. It has alarmed many countries and made some of them—such
                        as India—think again whether they should not attempt nuclear programs of
                        their own. This is likely to focus Arab suspicion even more upon Israel.</p>
                    <p>4. Our interest in the security of Israel remains unchanged, but the grave
                        responsibility which this puts upon us convinces us that we must leave no
                        stone unturned in our efforts to maintain peace. President hopes, therefore,
                        that <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> will see his way clear to
                        arrange for a visit by our people to Dimona in late November or early
                        December. <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss> we regard early inspection of
                        Dimona as imperative. End <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>.</p>
                    <pb n="242" xml:id="pg_242" facs="0274"/>
                    <p>5. In return, President has authorized following measures which we hope will
                        ease <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>'s problem:</p>
                    <p>a. We willing consider waiving Israel commitment to another six-monthly
                        inspection until after November 1965 elections, contingent upon satisfactory
                        findings next inspection and without prejudice to resumption schedule of
                        six-monthly visits thereafter.</p>
                    <p>b. We also willing postpone passing results inspection to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> until after November 1965, unless
                        situation in Near East such that US and Israeli interests better served by
                        informing him. We would, of course, consult GOI before such step. However,
                        you should emphasize that the agreement on semi-annual visits to Dimona is
                        particularly important to our efforts with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, because he knows, as does the rest of the world,
                        that Israel is probably the only country in the Near East which has the
                        scientific capability to produce nuclear weapons and also has a facility in
                        being which could be converted to such production. If we were unable to
                        reassure <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> periodically, for
                        example, he might well be driven to greater dependence on the Soviet Union
                        and even to irrational military action against Israel. He would, of course,
                        be more resistant to our urgings that he limit his own arms development,
                        particularly in the middle field.</p>
                    <p>6. If <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> avers that his problem is
                        with “hard liners” in Cabinet, you can point out our difficulty in
                        understanding this argument, since <gloss target="#t_BG1">BG</gloss>
                        personally agreed to periodic inspections in May 1963, presumably with
                        concurrence of Cabinet.</p>

                        Press reports had noted that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BLD2">Battle</persName> who lives further away than fire or police stations
                        able reach Embassy from his home through mob before police and firemen. Also
                        noted that when police did arrive, concentrated on front of building leaving

                        delivered note of protest to Acting Foreign Minister Abu Shadi. We

                            27. (Ibid.)</note> Abu Shadi expressed astonishment at protest and
                        claimed <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> had done all that could be
                        expected. Also, that Washington not taking as serious view as Embassy. We
                        wished disabuse <gloss target="#t_UARG1">UARG</gloss> of any such idea. Dept

                        regret. Jernegan noted only regret so far had come from Chief of police and
                        from Abu Shadi, but latter very matter of fact. Ordinarily, this handled by
                        foreign government official visiting scene and government issuing public

                    <p>After presenting substance Deptel 3092, Jernegan remarked that series of
                        things had created impression in US of <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                        hostility. It seemed there no policy followed by US which free <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> criticism. While we recognized that
                            US–<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> relations cannot be based on what
                        said in press, <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> could not help but think

                    <p>1904. I called this morning on Prime Min Ali Sabri at his request. He began
                        conversation by saying not necessary repeat all the things Fawzi had said to
                            me.<note n="2" xml:id="d111fn2">Telegram 1885 from Cairo, November 28,

                            (Ibid.)</note> Then stated interested in use of phrase “pre-arranged and
                        premeditated” (Sabri's words) in note and in conversation. He asked that I
                        give him any evidence we had this point. I stated there could be no doubt of
                        pre-arrangement if one examined nature of incident and its success from
                        point of view those who wished it. I said that if he read carefully my
                        statement and our note, he would see that I had never stated by whom
                        incident arranged and had refrained carefully from any charge Egyptian
                        involvement. I said I had done this and reported my govt no Egyptians
                        involved even in light of numerous rumors and reports to contrary. I had
                        avoided carefully overemphasizing these rumors for fear of exacerbating
                        situation. I was now authorized to accept the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> note expressing deep pain and the statement of willingness
                        to negotiate compensation,<note n="3" xml:id="d111fn3">Telegram 1886 from

                        course, to successful working out matter. I said my prime purpose now was to
                        overcome bad effects this incident but that it was impossible for me to do
                        it alone. I must have their help. I said they had failed comply basic
                        customs in matters of this kind and that throughout night of incident many
                        of American and foreign press as well as others repeatedly asked me, “have
                        you heard from Egyptian Govt?,” to which I of course had to reply in
                        negative. I said I could only compare this with custom through centuries and
                        for example recent example in Sudan, where half of Cabinet called to express
                        regret for incidents, of which he aware since his govt involved in same
                        circumstances. He said he had not been aware of custom and thought that
                        sending Chief of Police with his expression adequate. I said his expression
                        concern had reached me only in the note and had not been conveyed by Chief
                        of Police. I told him that I had arrived two months ago with great hope and
                        great expectation strengthening our relations. I still had them and wished
                        to overcome problems surrounding this incident, but he must help and help
                        more than he had done before and after incident. I said good relations
                        two-way street, that I would do my part, but that I could do <pb n="245" xml:id="pg_245" facs="0277"/>no more than that. He said, “What would you
                        like me to do?” I said, prevent creation situations such as <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> press treatment issues involving US. I told
                        him I would like to inform US press that he had called me in today to repeat
                        expressions given me by Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FM5">Fawzi</persName> of
                            <gloss target="#t_GUAR1">GUAR</gloss> regret and willingness to discuss
                        compensation. He acceded.</p>
                    <p>Sabri repeated desire as expressed by Pres <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> in his recent speech to maintain good relations with
                        US. I said this also our desire, repeating again it was a two-way street. We
                        then sat for minutes in which neither of us spoke. I made no move terminate
                        conversation. He then repeated strong desire good relations. I said that
                        before leaving I wished to tell him that humanitarian mission conducted in
                        Congo had been completed, that large number hostages had been evacuated, and
                        that Belgian troops and US planes transporting them now out of area. I said
                        I had noted <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> press treatment given
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> statement this morning and
                        said I had sent off tel immediately asking for guidance. Response from
                        Washington had indicated statement taken out of context and had referred to
                        Congolese land movements.</p>
                    <p>Conversation very firm, slightly tense, but ended reasonably pleasantly. I
                        will talk with American press later today.</p>

                        prospect. To Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName>'s
                        question on why <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> wanted to sell the
                            F–5,<note n="2" xml:id="d112fn2">A December 5 memorandum from the Joint

                            aircraft was preferred for sale to Jordan but recommended selling F–104H
                            aircraft if the F–5 was unacceptable to the Jordanians. (Washington

                            <persName corresp="#p_SPOA1">Solbert</persName> replied that, in his
                        view, the F–5 would entail a lesser political reaction, plus the fact it is
                        easier to maintain. To a series of questions from the Governor, Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_SPOA1">Solbert</persName> replied that the
                        Jordanians say they now want to buy three squadrons of supersonics at 20
                        planes to the squadron, that Jordan has approximately 24 jet-trained pilots
                        and that beginning delivery dates of any American supersonic fighters to
                        Jordan would be at least three years into the future.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> inquired if there
                        was anything more to be said favoring the sale of American supersonic
                        aircraft. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SPOA1">Solbert</persName> stated we had
                        also to consider a Jordanian request for a large amount of ground equipment
                        for its Army. Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> asked
                        a number of questions, drawing out replies from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SPOA1">Solbert</persName> on the source of funds for
                        Jordan's military purchases, the relative importance of the ground and air
                        buildup and types of tanks desired.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> asked what the
                        chances would be of diverting the Jordanians to a West European supersonic
                        aircraft. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> responded that it
                        comes down to what kind of arms policy we want to pursue over the years in
                        the Near East. In his opinion, Jordan's acquisition of either <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>'s or American supersonic aircraft would
                        trigger irresistible pressures from Israel for reciprocal or better
                        treatment. Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName>'s
                        question therefore came down to the nub of the issue. A short discussion
                        then ensued on how strong Israeli pressure would be if American supersonics
                        of any kind were sold to Jordan.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> asked what attitude
                        Jordan would have toward taking West European supersonics. Assistant
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> replied he understood
                        that King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> had expressed a
                        desire for <pb n="247" xml:id="pg_247" facs="0279"/>the French Mirage IIIC
                        to President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> during the
                        King's recent visit to France. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> proposed we tell <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> that if a West European aircraft were available he
                        should obtain this type aircraft and that we could not, for political
                        reasons, supply an American aircraft. If the King persisted that he must
                        bend to <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> pressures to accept a <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss> squadron, we should inform him that to do
                        so would be at the cost of reduced American support to Jordan.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName> expressed the view that we
                        probably had not worked hard enough initially to persuade King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> against early acquisition of any
                        supersonic aircraft and that we should go back and inform him we could not
                        supply American, nor could we acquiesce in his acquisition of Soviet
                        aircraft. We should also go to Cairo in a further effort indirectly to
                        dissuade Jordan from acquiring supersonics. However, we would leave enough
                        opening in our position with Hussein to be able to fall back to a European
                        supersonic if this appeared absolutely necessary. Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> asked if the group could agree on
                        a European airplane. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> said
                        that this would be his recommendation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName> replied we should make every effort to dissuade the
                        King from any early supersonics at all but he recognized that we might fail.
                        There was general agreement that pre-Summit and other pressures of last
                        summer, which had required our buying time rather than confronting <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> head-on, had now eased. We could
                        and should now take a harder line.</p>
                    <p>To Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName>'s question on the
                        timing of our reply to King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>
                        on supersonics, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> said he did
                        not favor borrowing trouble by saying anything to the King at this point. We
                        would like to leave the situation somewhat flexible and review what our
                        reply should be as December 31, 1964 approached.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName> proposed letting the White
                        House handle any disappointed American airplane manufacturers who might
                        protest a European aircraft sale to Jordan. This proposal was immediately
                        accepted without debate. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName>
                        thought we should make crystal clear to King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> our opposition to his acquisition of <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>'s. Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> agreed, stating we would probably have to pull out
                        of Jordan if <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> did so. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> agreed that any appearance
                        of hesitation on the aircraft issue might well be fatal to our aims.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> replied to Governor
                            <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName>'s request for a summary
                        of his recommendations by proposing (1) that an amended version of the Air
                        Survey Report consistent with our political objectives be worked out for
                        presentation to the Government of Jordan, (2) that when our position is
                        ready we inform <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> there are a
                        whole range of priorities in Jordan's drive for increased armaments, (3)
                        that Jordan can well do without any supersonic aircraft, (4) that the
                        acquisition of Soviet <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>'s would be a very
                        critical matter from our point of view, and (5) (if <pb n="248" xml:id="pg_248" facs="0280"/>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> were adamant) that
                        acquisition of West European supersonics could be acquiesced in by us. The
                        Governor said he was persuaded of the wisdom of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName>'s recommendations.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> asked how we would
                        deal with <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> in carrying out
                        these tactics. In the discussion that followed, the consensus was: (1) Our
                        future discussions will be at the <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> level; (2) We would have either the Ambassador or a
                        special emissary pursue the discussions with <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>; (3) We would discuss a full package, ground and
                        air, with <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>, rather than
                        proceeding piecemeal; (4) The question of who would pursue the discussions
                        with <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> would be decided after
                        the details of our ground and air positions had been worked out in
                        Washington.</p>
                    <p>A further exchange took place involving Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SPOA1">Solbert</persName>, Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName>, Mr. Meyers and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SHM1">Symmes</persName> concerning the F–5 aircraft. A discussion ensued of
                        its characteristics and whether there would be any value in offering it to
                        Jordan. Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> could not
                        see the advantage to offering the F–5. Selling it to Jordan would have
                        almost if not all of the adverse effects on our arms policy that we saw in
                        the F–104. However, if it were desired to hold it deep in the background as
                        a possibility ultimately to sell to Jordan, should everything else fail, he
                        would not object. Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName>
                        said he hoped as a result of the foregoing words that the U.S. Air Force and
                        the Pentagon would not try to sell the F–5 to the Jordanians while we were
                        trying to induce the Jordanians either to forego supersonics or settle on a
                        West European squadron.</p>
                    <p>A short discussion followed on the desirability of better controlling
                        American aircraft manufacturers in various parts of the world. Mr. Meyers
                        said quite effective controls had been established over the activities of
                        American aircraft salesmen in South America and he deemed it desirable that
                        further efforts be made to assert this kind of control in the Middle East
                        area. Others present emphatically agreed.</p>

                        Ben-Gurion participated.</p>
                    <p>Embassy's reporting suggests that with approach elections domestic pressures
                        likely increase rather than lessen. Thus, inspection earlier than January 30
                        would appear decrease risk adverse domestic political repercussions.</p>
                    <p>Our inability fathom <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>'s arguments
                        for delay naturally heightens our security fears. <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>'s remark that “we cannot build nuclear weapon in two
                        months” not reassuring in light estimate US experts that if Israel decided
                        to produce weapon following January 1964 inspection, it could produce enough
                        plutonium for one or two nuclear devices by the end of 1965. </p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> of course would not presume to suggest
                        to <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> best timing of inspection
                        politically. We hope however he will not invoke domestic political problems
                        as pretext for further delays. Given other indications suggesting that
                        Israel may be engaged in development weapon, further efforts delay
                        inspection would bring into question Israel's good faith. End <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>.</p>

                    <p>The Secretary opened the discussion by telling the Minister that the U.S.
                        policy toward Syria was one of support for the independence, security and
                        prosperity of Syria. The Minister reciprocated the Secretary's comment. The
                        Minister went on to express the pleasure of the Syrian Government and the
                        Syrian people in the re-election of President Johnson. The Syrians, he said,
                        felt that the Johnson Administration showed good understanding of the
                        aspirations of national liberation movements. He also remarked on the great
                        understanding shown by the U.S. in the current Security Council discussion
                        of Syria's complaint against Israel.<note n="2" xml:id="d114fn2">Both Israel
                            and Syria had requested an urgent meeting of the Security Council
                            following an outbreak of fighting on the Israeli-Syrian border on
                            November 13. The Security Council considered the complaints at nine
                            meetings between November 16 and December 21. Documentation concerning
                            the discussions at the United Nations is ibid., Central Files 1964–66,

                    </p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that it was unfortunate that Israel had moved the tractor
                        into the zone in the first place; it was unfortunate that the Syrians had
                        begun shooting; and it was unfortunate that the incident escalated as it
                        did. The Minister noted that there was no precedent for an aerial attack of
                        the sort mounted by Israel. The Security Council had not been able to deal
                        with it and it was clear that the U.N. machinery in the area must be enabled
                        to cope with such problems. The Syrian Govenment was insistent on remapping
                        and marking the entire demarcation line as recommended in para. 45 of the
                        report of the <gloss target="#t_UNTSO1">UNTSO</gloss> Chief of Staff (August
                        23, 1963). The marking could, of course, be done step-by-step but unless the
                        entire line is remapped, incidents might recur indefinitely. Dr. Mufti
                        interjected that if the remapping were to be done only in the northern
                        sector, Israel might later be unwilling to consider doing the same in other
                        areas.</p>
                    <p>Later in the conversation the Minister returned to the subject of Arab-Israel
                        relations in general, stating that he would be derelict in his duty to his
                        Government and to other Arabs unless he expressed to the Secretary the grave
                        feelings of the Arabs in the face of Israel's long-term expansionist and
                        hostile aims. The Minister spoke at length of the inculcation in the minds
                        of Israeli young people of hostile attitudes <pb n="252" xml:id="pg_252" facs="0284"/>toward Arabs. This mentality, when associated with Israel's
                        projects in the field of nuclear research filled the Arabs with great
                        foreboding.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary responded by affirming that the U.S. was opposed to territorial
                        expansion and the spread of nuclear weapons. The Secretary then asked the
                        Minister what kind of situation might prevail if, hypothetically, the
                        element of fear might be removed on both sides, noting that the Israelis
                        also had occasion for their fear since they understood that many Arabs
                        thought of Israel as a people marked for destruction. The Minister replied
                        that it was not possible to conceive of such a situation given the present
                        activities of the Israelis.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary reminded the Minister of the U.S. efforts to restrict the
                        spread of nuclear weaponry. When the Minister expressed a fear that Israel
                        might be able to acquire nuclear weapons through the private sector, the
                        Secretary expressed doubt that such a thing was possible and assured the
                        Minister that the U.S. Government watches every aspect of nuclear production
                        very closely.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary told the Minister that the two of them would keep in touch on
                        the matters they had been discussing. He remarked that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KRB1">Ridgway Knight</persName> was an old friend of his and
                        noted that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KRB1">Knight</persName> had a
                        direct channel of communication which the Minister could avail himself of
                        whenever he had a personal message for the Secretary.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> noted that the Secretary's

                            <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> was asked at his December 23

                            to the United Arab Republic; he replied that this was not being
                            discussed but that “relationships are reciprocal” and “if relations are
                            to be good, both sides must make important investments in those

                            Memorandum of December 24, which called it “Nasir's bitterest attack on

                        excerpts of which were received after the Secretary's press conference,
                        would be interpreted by the press as a direct confrontation between the U.S.
                        and Nasser. He thought our broader interest would suffer if we reacted
                        sharply to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s remarks. He
                        thought we should “sit on our hands” for now. He proposed that we suspend
                        all action on any new economic aid to the U.A.R., including the request for
                        amounts of corn supplementary to the agreed amounts for the third year of
                        the multi-year agreement, pending resolution of our policy differences.
                        Existing programs, he thought, should be continued.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> said he thought we
                        should not take any new initiatives with the U.A.R. but carry out any
                        standing commitments. These need not, he suggested, include further
                        processing of the grain storage project which had been stalled for some
                        time. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MWBJ1">Macomber</persName> said that there
                        was approximately $15 million in the AID pipeline in non-PL 480
                        assistance.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked about the safety of dependents in the hinterland of the
                        U.A.R. in the event of demonstrations in the aftermath of <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s speech. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MWBJ1">Macomber</persName> said that there were some
                        Americans in Assiut, but he did not believe under present circumstances
                        these would be endangered. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName>
                        and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DRP1">Davies</persName> felt it highly
                        unlikely that possible demonstrations would endanger American lives.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> said he thought in
                        considering future relations with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, the last sentence of Marquis Childs' article in
                        Wednesday's “Washington Post” was pertinent “… this (U.A.R.) is a new world
                        and unless it is recognized as such, it will move wholly out of the orbit of
                        the West.” The Soviets, he said, were standing by to pick up any advantage
                        they could from deteriorating U.S.-U.A.R. relations. In addition, we had
                        major interests such as Israel's security, overflight rights, Hussein's
                        stability, facilities at Wheelus, Kagnew and other spots which <pb n="254" xml:id="pg_254" facs="0286"/>could be damaged through U.A.R. influence
                        or action. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> might, for
                        instance, convince the Kuwaitis to draw down their security holdings in
                        London. The question that faces us is whether we should seek confrontation
                        with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> or continue our long-term
                        effort to moderate his policies.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> said we should look
                        at the reverse of the coin, how much would we pay to dislodge the Soviets
                        from an enhanced position in the Near East and Africa. For all the vast
                        Soviet investment, so far they have received few dividends. Their fortunes
                        would look up if U.S.-U.A.R. relations deteriorate.</p>

                        would raise tremendous pressure domestically for termination of aid. If we
                        decide to continue economic assistance, it will perhaps be necessary for a
                        full and frank briefing of the Foreign Relations Committee and key members
                        of Congress. He thought continued assistance was in the best interest of the
                        U.S. He noted that inside the U.A.R. the drift toward the East had alarmed
                        pro-West elements. We had received several indications that these felt U.S.
                        economic support was essential to prevent a rise in pro-Soviet influence
                        within the regime. We heard recently through a friendly intelligence service
                        from the Egyptian General Intelligence Agency, ostensibly on behalf of
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, that he would welcome
                        U.S. assistance in ameliorating his precarious financial situation and in
                        improving relations. Earlier in the day Henry Fowler had told him that the
                        speaker of the U.A.R. Assembly a few days before had proposed to an
                        associate of Robert Anderson that a U.A.R. Vice Presidential party be
                        invited to come to Washington to discuss with the President the Salhia
                        project and means of improving relations.</p>
                    <p>To date no major U.S. interest has been hurt by <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>. If we clash we are certain to incur some damage. We
                        should now avoid any actions which would provide a basis for further
                        deterioration of our relations.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary suggested that we might assume a posture of taking no
                        initiative whatsoever and waiting until the U.A.R. came to us for economic
                        or other discussions.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MWBJ1">Macomber</persName> said that this would mean
                        suspending action with respect to new projects contemplated in the $25
                        million <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> '65 level of A.I.D. loans. After
                        recalling that no A.I.D. loans were made to the U.A.R. in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> '64, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MWBJ1">Macomber</persName> noted that there were several projects <pb n="255" xml:id="pg_255" facs="0287"/>still in the process of completion which
                        had been funded in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> '63. He indicated that
                        there would be little difficulty in holding up on the new (<gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> '65) projects but that, with the exception of
                        the grain silo project, it would be a much more complicated task to suspend
                        those <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> '63 funded projects which were
                        presently underway. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> noted
                        that since getting agreement in principle to the $20 million commodity loan
                        for fiscal '64, the U.A.R. had received $100 million in loans from Kuwait
                        and $280 million from the Soviet Union. Our aid leverage, therefore, was
                        limited except for PL 480.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary decided PL 480 and aid in pipeline except for silo project will
                        continue. We will not at this time proceed with processing supplementary PL
                        480 request or new aid agreements.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary suggested that if the U.A.R.G. comes to us to discuss aid, we
                        should indicate our desire to continue cooperation but also talk beyond to
                        U.A.R. actions which make it difficult to justify additional aid to American
                        people and Congress.</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">For Tel Aviv</hi>. You should make following points to
                        Acting Foreign Minister:</p>
                    <p>1. Although <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> decision technically nullified
                        by Soviet veto, believe resolution as amended constituted expression of
                        majority opinion which should not be ignored. Comment by Israeli Foreign
                        Minister after <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> vote on Almagor incident
                        September 4, 1963,<note n="3" xml:id="d116fn3">On September 3, 1963, the
                            Security Council failed to adopt a U.S.-British draft resolution (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>/5407) concerning an August 19 incident on
                            the Israel-Syrian border, with 8 votes in favor, 2 against, and 1
                            abstention, the Soviet Union voting in the negative.</note> equally
                        appropriate this instance: “Technical veto cannot detract in slightest from
                        moral and political significance of stand formulated in Security
                        Council.”</p>
                    <p>2. Differences between majority and minority in <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> had essentially to do with <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>'s interpretation of events November 13. On question of what
                        should be done to prevent such incidents in future there was consensus that
                        demarcation in disputed areas and participation in <gloss target="#t_MAC1">MAC</gloss> meetings by Israel and Syria are necessary.</p>
                    <p>3. Israel would serve cause peace in area by acting in spirit this limited
                        but very real consensus.</p>
                    <p>4. We think Israel should continue to exercise same restraint in response in
                            <gloss target="#t_UNTSO1">UNTSO</gloss> request it has exercised during
                        last three weeks in Tel al-Qadi area both there and elsewhere along <gloss target="#t_ADL1">ADL</gloss>. Specifically we would hope Israel would
                        not resume patrolling in disputed Tel al-Qadi area but rather attempt again
                        by working with <gloss target="#t_UNTSO1">UNTSO</gloss> to remove causes of
                        conflict in area or at least agree to such measures as <gloss target="#t_UNTSO1">UNTSO</gloss> might suggest that would minimize
                        danger of escalation such as occurred November 13.</p>
                    <p>5. We exerted considerable effort to see that unbalanced resolution did not
                        emerge from <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>. If controversial Israeli
                        patrolling activities are a proximate cause of further violence in Tel
                        al-Qadi area we would find it very difficult—if SC is again seized of
                        matter—to achieve even limited influence on other members we succeeded in
                        achieving this time.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">For Damascus</hi>. Appreciate fully our limited influence
                        with <gloss target="#t_SARG1">SARG</gloss> but believe expression our views
                        could have some positive effect. You should inform Acting Foreign Minister
                        (a) We deeply regret Sovs vetoed res which contained nothing of harm to
                        Syria and so many elements favorable to its long-term wishes, viz., a strong
                        request “that Israel as well as Syria participate fully in meetings” of
                            <gloss target="#t_MAC1">MAC</gloss>. (b) Our conviction that in spite
                        veto <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> majority opinion should be respected.
                        (c) Whatever<pb n="257" xml:id="pg_257" facs="0289"/>
                        <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> differences on interpretation November 13
                        incident there was limited unanimous agreement <gloss target="#t_MAC1">MAC</gloss> should be fully utilized and demarcation Tel al-Qadi area
                        should be matter first priority. (d) We hope Syria will make special effort
                        cooperate with <gloss target="#t_UNTSO1">UNTSO</gloss> to reduce tension in
                        Tel al-Qadi area, specifically as regards efforts to demarcate line.</p>
                    <p>To possible recriminations that we in service Israel during <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> debate you should not fail note Israelis had

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> asked whether the Embassy
                        and USIS should be authorized to accept the U.A.R. offer of a building for
                        the library.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary replied that it would be necessary to touch base with the
                        President before an answer could be given on this. The President had been
                        extremely upset by the signing of the purchase agreement for $17 million
                        worth of wheat. In retrospect, the decision to continue all aid on the
                        pipeline should have been checked out with the White House. The Secretary
                        also said that the President is genuinely perturbed over the incivility
                        manifested by <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> and other
                        radical leaders. He is inclined to consider such deportment unacceptable in
                        international relations.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s speech was
                        not the core of our immediate problem; U.A.R. assistance to insurgency in
                        the Congo was. If <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> continues
                        support of “wars of liberation” in Africa, we are on a collision course. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> said that he thought
                        yesterday's Security Council resolution on the Congo may provide a platform
                        for a dialogue with the U.A.R.G. on this problem. The Secretary pointed out
                        there were unpalatable elements in the resolution.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked about the merits of adopting a posture of not responding
                        to U.A.R. overtures.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> said that this was difficult
                        because there were day-to-day decisions that had to be made such as the one
                        involved in meeting a U.A.R.G. request for 250,000 tons of wheat flour under
                        the multi-year PL–480 agreement. Agriculture now thought that no more than
                        50,000 tons could be justified. We need to send a telegram to the Embassy to
                        acquire additional information. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> recommended that we proceed to get the data and,
                        depending on the course of events, apprise the U.A.R. Ambassador during his
                        call on the Secretary that we would move ahead on this request.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary agreed that the telegram could go provided the Embassy was in a
                        position to provide the information without approaching U.A.R.
                        officials.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that Senator Hickenlooper had come to see him in great
                        agitation over U.S.-U.A.R. relations. He had become somewhat calmer,
                        however, when the Secretary pointed out that we had not <pb n="259" xml:id="pg_259" facs="0291"/>proceeded on the $25 million commodity
                        loan, that we had not met U.A.R. requests for additional aid, and that we
                        were coasting along on past commitments.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said the CAB/FAA report on the Mecom aircraft should be
                        surfaced normally through FAA channels. He thought Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> should have a responsible officer
                        carry the preliminary conclusions of the investigation to Mr. Mecom, along
                        with <gloss target="#t_FBI1">FBI</gloss> information on the background of
                        the plane's Captain. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> said
                        that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DRP1">Davies</persName> would do so next
                        Tuesday.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary thought it quite clear that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s speech attacking Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BLD2">Battle</persName> and the U.S. had been sparked by the
                        version given him of the discussion between Battle and the Minister of
                        Supply on U.A.R. aid requests.<note n="4" xml:id="d117fn4">A December 24

                    </p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> noted that this information
                        had been imparted as <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> was about
                        to make what is characteristically the most emotion-laden speech of the
                        year.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary repeated that the Congo rather than the speech represented the
                        core of our problem. He thought it likely that the Sudanese could be brought
                        to cut off transit of arms to the rebels. That would make it easier for the
                        U.A.R. to back away.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> said in briefing the press
                        he planned to emphasize that while we could not have close relations with
                        the U.A.R. given some basic differences, our national interests require
                        reasonably good working relations.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he thought that we should point out that it is in our
                        interest that we maintain correct relations as well as a modest presence and
                        influence. Without these we will have no capability of seeking to moderate
                        U.A.R. policy. He thought we should not emphasize our vulnerabilities to
                        U.A.R. pressures since that might give <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> an exaggerated idea of his capabilities. The
                        Secretary thought it would be useful to let the press know that there are
                        people in the U.A.R. and Arab world who are extremely concerned about
                        relations between the U.S. and U.A.R.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. Jordan Arms Requests </p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> raised King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>'s eagerness to get American
                        supersonics to fill his commitment to the Unified Arab Command. The Pentagon
                        wanted to supply American aircraft, specifically the F–104's. The Department
                        felt that provision of American aircraft to Jordan would <pb n="260" xml:id="pg_260" facs="0292"/>bring about the crumbling of our policy of
                        arms restraint, particularly as regards Israel.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked if it would not be possible for Jordan to get aircraft
                        from France. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> replied we
                        were pushing this but the French aircraft were twice as expensive as
                        American aircraft.</p>
                    <p>In response to the Secretary's question whether we had filled the Israelis in
                        on this problem, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> said that
                        we were unable to do this until we had our internal lines straightened out.
                        Some Israelis would fear <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>'s in Jordan.
                        Some would prefer American to Soviet planes and might be willing to agree
                        not to press for comparable treatment for Israel. Some others, however,
                        would consider provision of U.S. aircraft as opportunity to press for U.S.
                        supply of arms to Israel. We were making efforts to dissuade the Jordanians
                        from the <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>'s and might in the end tell
                        them that we could not accept <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>'s in
                        Jordan. The Secretary asked whether, in fact, we would go that far. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> said that if the Jordanians
                        accepted Soviet equipment the whole nature of our problem would change,
                        prospects for arms control or restraint would be diminished and, possibly,
                        the situation would then force the change in our relations.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that obviously supersonics for Jordan in the Arab-Israel
                        context did not make sense. However, the F5 might provide an acceptable
                        compromise.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> responded that clearly we
                        might have to negotiate on this, and he contemplated going to Amman in late
                        January for this purpose. The Secretary agreed but again said that it was
                        highly preferable that the Jordanians get their aircraft from either the
                        British or the French.</p>

                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>: We fully recognize that informal
                        consultations will have to be held now and then with Israel. However,
                        Israel's insistence upon periodic high-level meetings causes us concern.
                        While consistent with Israel objective promote public identification with
                        US, meetings not necessarily in interest either Israel or US. Moreover,
                        there is no “agreement” on holding meetings. Israeli officials including
                            <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> proposed them but President
                        did not express specific agreement and consensus US officials was that
                        occasional ad hoc meetings as needed might be desirable. We have noted
                        repeated Israeli efforts parlay consensus into formal agreement. Since
                            <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> visit, about ten such
                        meetings have occurred.</p>
                    <p>We also concerned about any proposal for formal, high-level meeting. This
                        sort of publicized consultation was not suggested by anyone here last June,
                        and in fact is contrary to spirit of informal quiet consultations proposed
                        by Israelis themselves. Fanfare would inevitably attend formal, high-level

                        facts do not warrant. This could well come at a time when US relations with
                        Arabs over <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> and other matters in critical
                        phase. Military meeting would seem unnecessary in view numerous recent
                        discussions between high-level US and Israeli civilian and military
                        officials over past months. Meetings would 1) reduce our ability help
                        improve Israel's position in Near East by moving us one more step toward
                        joint consultations and contingency planning we oppose, 2) give Arabs
                        evidence to support their contention we backing Israel against them, and 3)
                        accomplish nothing that lower-level, informal, political discussion could
                        not better achieve. End <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>.</p>

                        we suggest that <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> visit Israel
                        when he is in area next spring. We also accept in principle that, if we have
                        specific military topics which we agree should be discussed, then another
                        round of quiet military talks could be arranged at an appropriate time after

                            <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> this morning making

                        Foreign Office, who also <pb n="263" xml:id="pg_263" facs="0295"/>present,
                        copy of talking paper which consisted of close paraphrase all points
                        enumerated therein.</p>
                    <p>There followed lengthy discussion in which I emphasized that these were
                        minimum requirements to enable visit to accomplish purpose envisaged by
                        President and Prime Minister and that insofar as they are more complex than
                        previous requirements, this added complexity arises from fact reactor has
                        now been operating over twelve months since last observation.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister expressed concern that specificity these detailed requirements
                        would seem to alter nature of visit to which he and his predecessor had
                        agreed and he apprehensive that in circumstances he might feel necessary to
                        consult Cabinet again, which if at all possible he anxious to avoid. He said
                        it now appears what we desire is “inspection” as distinct from the visit by
                        scientists as guests of Israel. Such inspection would raise familiar issue
                        of prejudice to Israeli sovereignty and there no precedent in relationships
                        between any two countries he could think of justify such procedure. I
                        assured him there no intention our part to alter nature of visit and
                        reiterated that specific requirements solely designed to enable observation
                        by visitors to accomplish purposes originally set forth in line intervening
                        developments since previous visits. While obviously not entirely reassured
                        Prime Minister then said that he would send me his final comments within
                        next day or two. Without discussing other specifics he declined agree to a
                        full two days (nor to my alternative suggestion that might be possible
                        arrange for team to visit on two successive Saturdays) but said he would be
                        prepared for team to begin visit on Friday, the 29th, at noon and extend
                        through Saturday evening, which corresponds to weekend when reactor
                        personnel absent and is in effect almost two days. In conclusion he again
                        stressed visit must be fundamentally on same basis as previous ones, that is
                        team must be invited guests of Israel and not “inspectors.” If I succeeded
                        in allaying his apprehensions, at least in part, I anticipate his
                        confirmation will be forthcoming in day or so.</p>
                    <p>Subsequently, Bitan of Foreign Office, who also present, told me in
                        confidence that he does not anticipate great difficulty with most of
                        requirements specifically probably no objection reviewing operating records
                        reactor and fuel. However, Israelis had already feared team might want to
                        bring scientific equipment of various sorts and our request that they be
                        permitted “perform physical inventory and make <pb n="264" xml:id="pg_264" facs="0296"/>independent measurements” tended confirm such fears.
                        Israelis, Bitan said, prepared facilitate inventory and independent
                        measurements with own instruments but would undoubtedly object to team
                        bringing own equipment.<note n="4" xml:id="d119fn4">Telegram 568 to Tel

                    <p>4008. <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> Meeting. <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                        Ambassador called on Secretary January 8 to appeal to <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> to step up aid. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> attended.</p>
                    <p>Secretary opened by stating he hoped quiet talks could counteract effects of
                        recent events on US–<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> relations. He would
                        welcome <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName>'s personal and official
                        appreciation of situation.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> expressed gratitude for
                        opportunity, conveyed <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s best
                        wishes for New Year to Secretary and President, and expressed personal hope
                        for year of constructive US–<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and global
                        cooperation.</p>
                    <p>As for unfortunate events triggered by Congo situation, <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> considered them minor, but they had
                        been dramatized in effort destroy <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>-US
                        relations. Help and wisdom of Secretary and President needed to overcome
                        this tactic. Hence <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> considered
                        this meeting with Secretary equally as significant as his meetings with
                        Secretary and President in 1961 when policy of US–<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> cooperation was laid down.</p>
                    <p>Because of its troubled history, its sharp contradictions in creed and
                        status, its current social upheaval, its proximity to Soviet Union, and its
                        preoccupation with Israel, <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> said
                        Near East was a particularly complicated area in a complicated world. Hence
                        Near East policy had to be formulated in expectation of such difficulties as
                        those just experienced. Objective was not to rake over old problems but to
                        seek solutions. Major US interests in area were preservation of Near East
                        independence, protection of Western economic interests, protection of status
                        quo, and control if not solution of Arab-Israel conflict. In 1958, <pb n="265" xml:id="pg_265" facs="0297"/>with crisis of confidence between
                        US and Egypt and Western troops in Jordan and Lebanon, all four US interests
                        were in jeopardy. <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> then arrived
                        in US to hear on all sides Near East was lost to Communism.</p>
                    <p>However, <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> said, activation of
                            US–<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> economic cooperation had kept
                        Communism out of Near East (even though it had infiltrated to within 80
                        miles of US shores), had frozen Arab-Israel conflict, muted inter-Arab
                        disagreements, and reduced area of Soviet opportunity; not one major US
                        interest had been touched. Why then the agitation in Congress?</p>
                    <p>To pursue protection of US–<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> cooperation,
                            <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> advocated that parties
                        beware of defeatism, pressure tactics, over-dramatization, and excess of
                        zeal—focussing instead on subtlety, restraint, and silence. If <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> did not fully recognize Egypt's need for
                        economic assistance in its demographic problem, Egypt might fall to the
                        Communists, and its loss to Free World might be as grave as loss of China.
                        Economic cooperation was one arena in which US had advantage over Soviet
                        Union. One hundred fifty million per year was modest investment in terms of
                        results achieved and dangers averted. Oil company revenues alone far
                        exceeded it.</p>
                    <p>In late 1963, primarily as result of Yemen problem but possibly also as
                        effect of US-Soviet detente, <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName>
                        said Egyptians had sensed slow-down in US aid. Implementation of existing
                        agreements continued, but no new areas of economic cooperation were
                        penetrated. Growing stress on negative aspects of US–<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> relationship had left mark on his Government that <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> now seeks to erase. Even at this,
                            <gloss target="#t_UARG1">UARG</gloss> had continued to fulfill its side
                        of the understanding by playing constructive roles in Arab, African, and
                        neutral summits and averting the war everyone had expected over Jordan
                        diversion. But <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName>'s efforts secure
                        reactivation of aid had failed. Recognizing limits on <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> capabilities, he had also sought <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> help and failed. In fact Woods' remarks
                        in Tokyo about <gloss target="#t_UARG1">UARG</gloss>'s delinquency on
                        foreign claims may have been contributing cause to recent incidents in
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>-US relations.</p>
                    <p>As the senior partner in the relationship, <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> said perhaps <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> could
                        muster more patience than <gloss target="#t_UARG1">UARG</gloss>. It did not
                        do for <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> to play the schoolteacher, react
                        to every line in foreign press, and follow policy of tit for tat. Such
                        policy grated on proud Mediterraneans, as Soviets recognized. They exercise
                        restraint even where Communist party banned. Recognizing Egypt as key to
                        Near East, they would keep up their campaign to win it over.</p>
                    <p>Turning to recent incidents, <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> said
                        he would not try to assess rights and wrongs and it did no good to cry over
                        spilt milk, but he agreed with Secretary's statements about need for respect
                        for diplomatic conventions. He regretted burning of library and felling of
                        plane; <pb n="266" xml:id="pg_266" facs="0298"/>he did not feel harsh words
                        necessary. But <gloss target="#t_UARG1">UARG</gloss> had met diplomatic
                        requirements on library, and in context of US global interest these
                        incidents were tempest in tea-cup. He hoped US response would match its
                        responsibilities. He proposed that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> and
                            <gloss target="#t_UARG1">UARG</gloss> put these incidents behind them,
                        focus on fact that 99 percent of thirty million Egyptians were predisposed
                        toward West, and open new chapter of cooperation by continuing PL–480
                        program after June 30, complying with request for increments to present
                        agreement, and perhaps by granting the twenty million dollar commodity loan
                        and enlisting help of <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> and other
                        states.</p>
                    <p>If <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> did not continue PL–480 program,
                            <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> could not conceive how we
                        could keep the US and the West in the Near East. Communists were constantly
                        at work in Egypt and were another cause of recent incidents.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> said France was making
                        approaches to <gloss target="#t_UARG1">UARG</gloss>, but he felt they were
                        tactical. In any event he felt his country's interest required that US
                        influence predominate.</p>
                    <p>To alleviate US–<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> friction over Congo,
                            <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> proposed this issue be left
                        to <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss>, with recognition that solution will
                        be long-term process. <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> was
                        hopeful position his Government would evolve toward that of <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> pointed to dangers in conducting
                        international relations in anger and in allowing annoyance over one issue
                        affect over-all relationship. He knew this was not the diplomatic style of
                        men at helm of <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>; foreign diplomats in
                        Washington were proud to know these men were leading world. He also paid
                        tribute to Department staff.</p>
                    <p>Finally, <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> asked if <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> could not take some action to mute annual
                        attack on <gloss target="#t_UARG1">UARG</gloss> in Congress. Repetition year
                        after year had heightened Egyptian doubts about durability of US–<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> relationship. Within limits of US
                        constitutional system, he felt President and Secretary could help guard
                        relationship from this quarter. He doubted it could survive another attack
                        like that of previous session. Whole <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>-US
                        relationship was now jeopardized by trivia. <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> believed in elemental need to preserve it. In this
                        effort he had 100 percent support of his government. He knew able US
                        Ambassador in Cairo was defending relationship with equal determination.</p>
                    <p>In reply, Secretary said he was grateful for <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName>'s clear and eloquent statement of his concern for our
                        relationship and ability with which he had pointed to its central elements.
                        To avoid misunderstanding, Secretary wished make clear he would not comment
                        definitively on all items <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> had
                        raised until another meeting. Some of these matters were of such importance
                        as to require that Secretary confer with President before replying.</p>
                    <pb n="267" xml:id="pg_267" facs="0299"/>
                    <p>Secretary agreed US–<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> relationship has had
                        constructive elements. Certainly Kennedy and Johnson administration had
                        sought to develop them. In narrow national sense, if <gloss target="#t_UARG1">UARG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                        were to draw up independently lists of their national interests, they would
                        find some major elements in common.</p>
                    <p>It was true that there were matters in background that were not easy to
                        forget on one side or the other, such as High Dam/Suez experience. The
                        record revealed complex elements which US and <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> must continue to try to wrestle with and circumscribe.</p>
                    <p>As for the more superficial aspects of recent events, we regretted that more
                        timely action had not been taken to prevent burning of library, but we could
                        fairly say that, in light of all circumstances, steps taken by <gloss target="#t_UARG1">UARG</gloss> in that matter would tend to indicate
                        that norms of diplomatic usage had been sufficiently met to warrant
                        considering case closed. Secretary could not however see incident's early
                        erasure from minds of Congress or American public.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> would have preferred that <gloss target="#t_UARG1">UARG</gloss> confine its measures on the American
                        cargo plane to pursuit over frontier and possible protest. Although we
                        recognized complications from <gloss target="#t_UARG1">UARG</gloss> point of
                        view and did not condone flight pattern of plane, we felt <gloss target="#t_UARG1">UARG</gloss> remedy had been a bit drastic. However,
                        we felt this incident was also behind us.</p>
                    <p>Speech of December 23 was kind that creates problems. Perhaps it reflected
                        sensitivity, but it had aroused counter-sensitivity. Secretary did not know
                        if speech had reflected misunderstanding of the talk between Stinu and our
                        Ambassador. Presence of Shelepin did not help anyone who sought to explain
                        the remarks. Secretary would not press exceptionally able ambassador like
                            <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> to defend another's
                        rhetoric, but Secretary was hearing of the speech several times a day. </p>
                    <p>Perhaps most serious problem between US and <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> was Congo. <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> had no
                        special national interest there, no appetite for special presence. For
                        several years we had supported Congo's unity and integrity through <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and through bilateral aid approaching half a
                        billion dollars. For most of period <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> had
                        worked in near unanimity with African states in effort to keep Cold War out
                        of Africa and prevent fragmentation of Congo. While Adoula was Prime
                        Minister, we had learned of illegal arms shipments into Congo from Tanzania
                        and Burundi territory. Weapons of Communist Chinese origin had been
                        captured. <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> had no fore-knowledge of
                        Tshombe appointment, but supports his Government under already existing
                        policy to support GDRC. <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> had been
                        disappointed and a little surprised by <gloss target="#t_UARG1">UARG</gloss>'s seeming association of itself with elements holding hostages
                        in northeast Congo. We felt we had acted with great patience under extreme
                        provocation during period August–November when rebels held incommunicado
                        many hostages including five American consular officers and subjected <pb n="268" xml:id="pg_268" facs="0300"/>them to barbaric indignity,
                        brutality, and threat of torture, execution, and cannibalism. These elements
                        with whom Cairo seemed to be associating self had in our eyes put themselves
                        beyond the pale of a civilized world. Provision of arms to Congo rebels,
                        particularly as an act of avowed national policy, was a grave issue. Most
                        arms reaching rebels were of Soviet manufacture. We had good information on
                        how they were reaching Congo. Their provision seemed to promote Cold War
                        type of conflagration we had tried five years to avoid. If it could be
                        stopped, we could concentrate our assistance on economic development.
                        Continuation of arms shipments made that very difficult. Secretary would
                        like to pursue this subject with <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName>
                        further in some detail. Since rebels are poorly trained, large quantities of
                        their weapons were falling into hands of Congo Government. There was now
                        some indication deliveries to rebels slowing down. We hoped we could find
                        answer through Security Council and OAU in order to prevent this issue from
                        intruding on totality of our relationships.</p>
                    <p>Secretary told <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> his effort
                        regarding existing US–<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> Food for Peace
                        agreements was to ensure that nothing was done to interrupt them, but, as
                        press showed, this effort was under very considerable attack. He viewed this
                        program as an important channel of US–<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                        communication; it contributed to welfare of Egyptian people, stood on its
                        own feet, and lent itself to kind of relationship that need not be affected
                        by every sensitive issue that arose. Objectively considered, there were
                        important national interests on both sides that can be basis of
                        cooperation.</p>
                    <p>For the future, we hoped for steady improvement in <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>-US relations. If Egypt should be free and prosperous, that
                        was extent of US national ambition for Egypt. On that basis we sought
                        cooperation and friendship. Secretary said he had tried limit his own public
                        statements, and he would hope by quiet discussion we would find better
                        answers than we had found thus far. He took encouragement from <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName>'s able and diligent efforts to find a
                        basis, and he paid those efforts full respect. The Ambassador should not
                        consider that what Secretary had said in this one meeting constituted full
                        reply to Ambassador's important statement. Secretary would wish to confer
                        with President.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> stressed once more urgency of
                        situation and his personal concern and urged that both sides resist
                        demagogy.</p>
                    <p>Secretary suggested that in next meeting perhaps <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> would comment on specifics of that urgency and, re his
                        compilation of US interest in good relations with <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, perhaps <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> could
                        also state how he sees Egyptian interest in good relations with US.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> said he could answer latter
                        question at once. Only alternative to cooperation with US was cooperation
                        with Soviet Union. Latter was greater danger to Egyptians. They counted on
                        power, patience, <pb n="269" xml:id="pg_269" facs="0301"/>and wisdom of US
                        more than on wisdom of others. He adjured <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> to continue economic cooperation and to be patient.</p>
                    <p>Secretary responded that, for our part, we needed help in enabling a great
                        democracy to be patient.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> closed discussion by contrasting
                        superficial benefit to Soviets of arms sales with lasting benefit to US of
                        food sales. By continuing economic cooperation, <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> could promote relaxation of Near East political tensions,
                        reduce Egyptian need for Soviet arms, and thus diminish Soviet leverage. If
                        Congress were to force cut-off of aid, it would promote exactly opposite
                        effect.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> said that decisions on how
                        to meet Jordan's arms request went far beyond our bilateral relations. These
                        could force abandonment of our traditional policy of restraint on sale of
                        arms to the Arab states and Israel. They could ultimately bring polarization
                        of the area with the Arab states armed and backed by the Soviets united
                        against a “Fortress Israel” armed and supported by the U.S. He was to impart
                        our decisions to King Hussein by the end of January during visit to
                        Amman.</p>
                    <p>The Unified Arab Command, financed by the Arab states of North Africa and the
                        Near East, has levied a requirement on Jordan to modernize and expand its
                        army and air force as part of an Arab program to <pb n="270" xml:id="pg_270" facs="0302"/>achieve parity with Israel. If the U.S. refuses to sell
                        arms to Jordan, King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> tells us
                        he will be forced to acquire Soviet equipment. He has withstood <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> pressure to standardize Arab military
                        inventories on the basis of Soviet equipment only by assuring the other Arab
                        states that the U.S. will provide essential equipment. If Jordan acquires
                        Soviet aircraft and tanks which would require Egyptian training crews,
                        Israel's alarm would be intense. We would find it difficult to justify
                        before Congress continued U.S. support of the Jordanian budget.</p>
                    <p>If we meet Jordan's request, thus violating our traditional Near East arms
                        policy, Israel probably would tolerate or even welcome our sales to Jordan
                        for she recognizes we could no longer fend off Israeli efforts to obtain
                        offensive American weapons. We believe the bitter emotional response of the
                        Arabs to the direct supply of offensive U.S. arms to Israel would be so
                        great that it might force those Arab states now drawing on Western arms to
                        turn to the Soviet Union. This would be a major step toward polarization
                        which our policies over the years have been designed to prevent.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked whether it would not be possible for the Jordanians to
                        meet at least its aircraft requirements from European sources.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> said that we hoped to
                        preserve the basic essentials of our arms policy by persuading King
                            <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> to acquire the French
                        Mirage fighter which is comparable to the Soviet <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss> 21 or our F–104. The British Lightning seems ruled out
                        because it is excessively heavy and expensive. In addition the British have
                        made clear that they will not consider credits in the sale of military
                        equipment to Jordan. If we can persuade Hussein to acquire the French plane,
                        we will have averted the worst of our potential problems with Congress and
                        preserved a chance of maintaining continued American restraint on arms sales
                        to the area.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DRP1">Davies</persName> noted that the French
                        Mirage was expensive with a fly-away cost for twenty aircraft of
                        approximately $28 million as compared to $12 million for the <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss> 21 and $27 million for the F–104G. Other
                        versions of the 104, the C and H, ran from $10 million to $20 million,
                        however.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> said that while we would
                        push for a European sale, we must be ready for the contingency that King
                            <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> will refuse to accept our
                        views. Although the balance of disadvantages is close, he believed that to
                        obviate Jordan's acquiring Soviet supersonics, he should have stand-by
                        authority to offer to consider selling American supersonic fighters.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> said the situation was also
                        complicated by Jordan's request for M–48–A–3 tanks with 105 mm cannons.
                        Although we recognize Jordan's need to modernize its armor, we have
                        previously declined to sell this particular tank to Israel. If we sold the
                        M–48–A–3 to Jordan <pb n="271" xml:id="pg_271" facs="0303"/>it would arouse
                        strenuous protest from Israel and its supporters in the United States. On
                        the other hand, if we talk the Jordanians down to the M–48 or the M–48 with
                        the diesel engine but not the 105 mm cannon, the Arabs will be incensed when
                        Israel acquires this model from other sources. There is some possibility
                        that the Arabs are aware that Israel is planning to acquire this particular
                        tank.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that the issues involved were so important as to require
                        consultation with the President. He asked for a very short summary of the
                            problem<note n="2" xml:id="d121fn2">The memorandum indicates that a

                        necessary to discuss these decisions with him.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> called me in evening January 17
                        to tell me he is greatly perturbed over recent developments concerning
                        diversion Jordan headwaters and that, in view of reports that Lebanese
                        parliament due to formulate <gloss target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss> position
                        this coming Thursday,<note n="2" xml:id="d122fn2">January 21.</note> he
                        thought it would be wise to ask <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> tell
                            <gloss target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss> that diversion is serious matter and
                        will be dealt with by <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> as serious matter.
                            <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> pointed out that what is at
                        stake is large portion (100 MCM's or more) of sweet water which is necessary
                        for Israel's development. <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> stated
                        he would not want to use force protect this water but sooner or later he
                        might have to do so. However, to avoid such development, <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> wished use <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> channel to exert counter-pressure upon GOL which, while
                        probably not wanting assume responsibility diverting waters, is subject <pb n="272" xml:id="pg_272" facs="0304"/>to Egyptian threats. He referred,
                        apropos such <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> assistance, to “promises”
                        and “assurances” he had received in his talks with President Johnson and
                        others in Washington.</p>
                    <p>I said that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> fully agrees that question
                        Jordan headwaters a serious matter and also believes that <gloss target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss> has some room free for maneuver. I pointed
                        out, however, that our assessment differs from <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>'s in that we do not think Lebanese suffering from any
                        misapprehension re Israeli attitude. Thus, while <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has had several talks with <gloss target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss> re diversion, we would wish avoid any undue pressure which
                        might provoke unfortunate Lebanese reaction, notably if Lebanese prestige
                        directly involved by such tactics.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> interrupted to say <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> certainly didn't wish press too much but
                        question was vital and that somewhere along the line there was a zero hour.
                        He didn't know of any halfway measures. I answered that I didn't think that
                        the critical point would be reached with the beginning of digging or the
                        pouring of concrete, but only when water was actually diverted from Israeli
                        use. If Israel forced employ drastic measure he feared, such measure would
                        be just as effective against completed works as it would in earlier stages
                        of construction and obviously consequences such intervention could be far
                        reaching and unpredictable, possibly disastrous. Since there was always the
                        possibility that Arabs would never be able get project off the ground I
                        thought <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> had every reason play this hand
                        out. <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> admitted that the
                        construction of pumping stations and tunnels would take time and that it is
                        a question of months rather than days. However, he is greatly perturbed and
                        wishes <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> know his concern and communicate
                        it to <gloss target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss>. Fundamentally, I believe he feels

                    <p>In assuring <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> that I would bring his

                        it would not be helpful if Israel started a big press campaign of

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Jordan Arms</hi>. <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> has asked for a meeting soon to lay before you our
                        painful dilemma here. Our Jordanian friends have been pressing us for months
                        to sell them arms and planes for the Arab buildup against Israel's water
                        diversion scheme, claiming that otherwise they'll have to buy Soviet items
                        being touted by the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>With Israel's tacit consent, we've been subsidizing Jordan for years, in
                        order to keep King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>—the most
                        sober of the Arab leaders—out of <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s clutches. We think Soviet arms in Jordan would be
                        the beginning of the end, and to be forestalled at almost any cost.</p>
                    <p>We've agreed in principle to some staggered arms sales to Jordan so long as
                        the Arab kitty can finance them, but have stalled on the key item—supersonic
                        aircraft. Our fear is that if we sell supersonics to Jordan for an announced
                        Arab buildup against Israel's diversion scheme, we'll come under acute
                        Israeli and US Zionist pressure to sell arms directly to Israel too. In
                        fact, our whole aid program to Jordan might come under attack. If we get
                        into overt arms sales to Israel, then all the Arabs <pb n="275" xml:id="pg_275" facs="0307"/>may turn against us, and Jordan may have to
                        accept Soviet and <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> arms anyway.</p>
                    <p>We owe King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> an answer by the
                        end of January. Our proposed strategy is to come through with some carefully
                        phased ground equipment sales, but to tell <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> he can't have either US or Soviet fighters without
                        jeopardizing US aid. If he feels absolutely compelled to get supersonic
                        fighters he should buy them from the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> or
                        France. We hope by this combined package to string out the whole program, in
                        hopes the Arab buildup against Israel will fall apart in time (as it has
                        before).</p>
                    <p>But <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> and now State's Arab experts fear
                        that <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> won't play. So they
                        propose as a fallback an offer of one US squadron by 1968–69 (which they
                        think <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> will buy) if he is
                        adamant.</p>
                    <p>Others of us oppose going this far now. We should try our hardest to turn
                            <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> aside before deciding on
                        any fallback because of the acute risk of a violent Israeli reaction. Also
                        we have promised <hi rend="italic">to clue the Israelis on what we
                            propose</hi>, and haven't told them, pending your decision.</p>
                    <p>A new complication is that the <hi rend="italic">Israeli/German/US tank deal
                            is now leaking</hi> (though our commitment to modernize the German M–48s
                        is still not out). This could be played up by the Arabs to force <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> to take Soviet arms. We told the
                        Israelis we might have to call the deal off if it leaked prematurely, and
                        may want to threaten this as pressure on them to keep their lips buttoned
                        (they may have been the leakers).</p>
                    <p>Another important part of this problem package is our policy toward the
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. We face a growing crisis in 1965 on
                        Jordan Waters, and if <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> wants he
                        can make it highly painful to us. The one issue on which he can always rally
                        the Arab brethren is Israel. So you might want to send Luke Battle back with
                        some quiet word that we'd rather talk than fight if only <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> would show a little understanding of
                        our problems too.</p>
                    <p>State will have a long paper for you shortly but I wanted to provide an
                        advance look tonight.</p>

                        support of dissident groups in the Congo and use of his influence in the
                        Organization of African Unity in support of the Central Congo Government.
                        The U.A.R. has indicated it will not buy a position of unconditional support
                        for Tshombe but shares our objective of seeing a stable, independent
                        Congolese Government emerge from the present chaos. We feel there is room
                        for some bargaining with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> on
                        this issue.</p>

                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> faces an acute supply crisis
                        coupled with a shortage of foreign exchange and credit facilities.
                        Termination of PL–480 shipments would aggravate the crisis although Soviet
                        assistance—granted at a price of further political concessions—would enable
                        him to ride it out, we believe. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s reliance on PL–480 foodgrains is so great that the
                        program poses the threat of unbalancing his economy unless he knows he can
                        count on it. Two years of Congressional criticism coupled with the “running
                        down” of our economic cooperation program have caused suspicion and
                        frustration. What we need to draw the U.A.R. into a more cooperative posture
                        is a “carrot” to hold before it—an assurance of continued support from the
                        “Food-for-Peace” program in the years ahead.</p>

                    <p>Getting back onto even keel with the U.A.R. is important for issues other
                        than the Congo. If we let the situation lead to an open break, Egypt will
                        use Arab solidarity and emotionalism to bring pressures to bear against
                        British and American interests and against Israel. Only the Soviets will
                        benefit from such a situation. We could lose military and civilian air
                        rights (<gloss target="#t_MATS1">MATS</gloss>, PanAm, TWA), oil concessions
                        (a billion dollars a year to the U.S. balance of payments), unharassed
                        passage of the Suez Canal, and much of our influence in the Arab world.
                        Friendly regimes in Jordan, Kuwait, Libya, and Saudi Arabia would be subject
                        to intense nationalistic and possibly subversive pressures. Arab Communist
                        parties would operate openly in the area as probable price for Soviet
                        support to the U.A.R. and other Arab states.</p>
                    <p>None of our major interests in the Near East have been damaged over the past

                    <p>The Secretary asked whether we could not arrange a tacit guarantee of
                        Jordan's security in lieu of selling it arms. The U.S. could say simply that
                        it would not permit Jordan to be overrun by Israel.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> said the Arabs held that
                        they would not attack Israel, but would react when Israel struck at the Arab
                        diversion project. Jordan <pb n="278" xml:id="pg_278" facs="0310"/>held it
                        was part of a defensive arrangement with the other Arab states. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> noted that circumstances
                        pushed <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> to cooperation with
                        the <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss>. His internal situation would be
                        seriously endangered if he didn't go along with the other Arabs. In
                        addition, Jordan's defensive position, like Israel's, was “thin,” given the
                        proximity of each other's forces.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> doubted Jordan could be
                        diverted from acquisition of additional arms. It sought, however, maximum
                        freedom of action from the <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> by acquiring
                        arms from the West.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said the U.S. had demonstrated its interest in Jordan's
                        independence through President Kennedy's statement of May 8, 1963.<note n="2" xml:id="d126fn2">Reference is to a statement on U.S. policy in the
                            Near East made by President Kennedy at a press conference on May 8,
                            1963, in the course of which he declared that the United States
                            supported the security of both Israel and its neighbors. (<hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the Presidents of the United States:
                                John F. Kennedy, 1963</hi>, p. 373)</note> He thought <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> knows his real enemy is Egypt, not
                        Israel. By deeper involvement in the <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss>,
                        the U.A.R. threat to Jordan was enhanced. <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> faced a bleak future of growing Egyptian influence
                        to his country and of certainty that Jordan would take the brunt of any
                        military engagement with Israel.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> could not draw back without
                        excluding himself “from the Club.” Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> agreed that this was the heart of the problem.
                            <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>, however, sought to
                        retain membership while keeping his powder dry. He wanted to avoid closer
                        military ties with Egypt which runs the <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss>
                        show, but psychic factors prevented him from disassociating himself from
                        Arab solidarity.</p>
                    <p>To the Secretary's question as to Saudi participation in the <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> and whether Kuwait wouldn't tire of making
                            <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> contributions, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> noted that Saudi Arabia was a full
                        participant and major financial contributor and that Kuwait's $100 million
                        per year increase in income assured continued support. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> noted that Libya would soon be in a
                        position to make larger contributions, and that these smaller states felt
                        they must keep on trying to buy their independence.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked whether we couldn't tell Jordan that we would not object
                        to its acquiring MIGs provided there were no Russians involved in training.
                        To Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName>'s remark that this then
                        would entail <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> trainers, the Secretary
                        noted that the Jordanians could be trained abroad on the <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> said that a preemptive U.S. sale seemed desirable if
                        Soviet arms supply threatened. Had we moved to meet Egypt's arms request in
                        1954, the Near East today might be quite different. The same was true in
                        Afghanistan in 1955 and India in 1962. It would have served both Israeli and
                        U.S. interests had we provided Egypt arms from the West. Although relations
                        might have been just <pb n="279" xml:id="pg_279" facs="0311"/>as bumpy, we
                        would have had some control through Egypt's need to purchase new equipment
                        and spares. Assuming <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> did not
                        dare leave the Club, would it serve our interest to limit Jordan to
                        procurement from the West. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>
                        said that Israel's bargaining power would be infinitely multiplied if Jordan
                        and the other Arab states went over to Soviet supply. We would have chosen
                        up sides. Israel could point to the Communist danger in the Arab states to
                        justify arms procurement from the U.S.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> said we had learned that the
                        Arabs knew full details of Israel's arrangements to acquire tanks. It was
                        certain that they would insist on Jordan getting what Israel got.
                        Significantly, Jordan's request for M–48 tanks had escalated to the M–48A3
                        tank with 105 mm cannon—just what Israel is getting. The Secretary noted
                        that we might suggest that <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>
                        get his tanks the same way that Israel does. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> said that there were 83 M–48s remaining in Germany
                        and these might make up most of the 100 in our proposed package for Jordan
                        (five-year).</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that both Israel and Jordan in acquiring tanks were behind
                        the times. Anti-tank missiles provided a surer defense. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> noted that the Pentagon had disagreed
                        with this thesis when we tried to apply it to Israel. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> noted that the diesel engine gave the
                        M–48 sufficient range to make it an offensive rather than a defensive
                        weapon.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> said that given unpalatable
                        alternatives, we believed that an effort to provide for a reasonably phased
                        modernization of the <gloss target="#t_JAA1">JAA</gloss> was the best for
                        us. We would space deliveries of $55 million worth of equipment over the
                        next four years. The minute division among the Arabs split the <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss>, we could cut off the pipeline. However, if
                        we forced a confrontation by refusing to sell, Jordan would be forced to a
                            Soviet/<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> basis for her army; if we
                        bought time by the sale there was some chance Arab solidarity might come
                        asunder.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> felt from the Israeli
                        viewpoint, either course would be advantageous. If American equipment went
                        to Jordan, Israel would press for American supply. If Communist equipment
                        went, Israel would press even harder for American supply.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> said that we anticipated a
                        negative Israeli reaction when they were informed of our decision. To reduce
                        the heat, instructions to Tel Aviv must indicate that the President approved
                        the decision.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary queried whether more time couldn't be given to consider
                        alternatives. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> said that
                        this was the fourth time we had been pressed for an answer. However, the
                        President's illness and the Churchill funeral could permit us to slip the
                        schedule for a week. We had still to get the President's clearance and to
                        inform the Israelis before we could proceed to informing <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>.</p>
                    <pb n="280" xml:id="pg_280" facs="0312"/>
                    <p>The Secretary asked whether instead of informing <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>, we could not put the alternatives to him and ask his
                        reaction as a loyal friend. Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> thought we would get a strong reaction with
                        arguments that we should force <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> to forego arms. We should be guided by our interest
                        in preempting the situation and by the desirability of U.S. control through
                        provision of spares and ammunition. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said that Israel would not object to a Soviet-U.S.
                        polarization of the arms supply situation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> assented and said that this would advance Israel's
                        objectives of a U.S. security guarantee and joint military planning.</p>
                    <p>In the Secretary's view the two principal questions were: should we buy into
                        both sides of an arms race? Should we buy major items of equipment for the
                            <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> given its objective of developing
                        strength against Israel? He asked whether this was something we could work
                        out with the Soviets. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName>
                        replied that he had discussed this possibility with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> who agreed that the Soviets had
                        nothing to gain from restraint. Arm sales provided the principal entree for
                        Soviet influence into the Near East. Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> thought there was no harm in trying this out with
                        the Soviets.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> said that we had learned
                        that the details of Israel's tank purchase arrangements were known to the
                        press and they could hit headlines within two or three days. Our agreement
                        with Israel was conditioned by a secrecy clause which could be invoked if
                        the matter came to public knowledge. He felt that the strength of Arab
                        reaction could be minimized if we cancelled that part of the arrangement
                        which dealt with retrofit kits. We could then say that we had given approval
                        to the shipment of M–48 tanks from Germany to Israel and apprise the
                        Israelis that we could consider later a direct deal on diesel engines.</p>
                    <p>Both Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> and Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> noted that Prime Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> and those accompanying him
                        in June had given categorical assurances that the transaction through the
                        Germans and Italians could be kept secret for two or three years.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> said that in the event of
                        cancellation, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName> was
                        extremely worried about our public posture if the Israelis or the Germans
                        leaked the fact that we had agreed to provide retrofit equipment. We could
                        not very well deny the agreement even if we were able to say that we were
                        not fulfilling it.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that he felt the cancellation of our part of the
                        arrangement would leave both the Germans and Italians out on a limb. We had
                        pushed the Germans into the deal and we should stand by it. As a great power
                        we cannot back away from an agreement freely entered into. If the Arabs
                        protested, we could note the large flow of Soviet arms to the area and that
                        no-one publicized Soviet deals with the Arabs. We could also tell them that
                        we would welcome resort to <pb n="281" xml:id="pg_281" facs="0313"/>the
                        Geneva Conference to explore ways and means of limiting the flow of
                        armaments to the area. We should accordingly not invoke our cancellation
                        right.</p>
                    <p>On the problem of Jordan arms, the Secretary decided action would be delayed
                        until he could acquaint the President with the proposal.</p>

                    <p>4384. For the Ambassador. When you see <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> you may draw on the following as appropriate:</p>
                    <p>1. You know that the President wants to maintain good relations with the
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, if the US is given the opportunity
                        to do so. He sees that we share major interests in the independence and
                        strengthening of the Near East states. He will continue to work for
                        constructive relations with all Near Eastern states and for impartiality in
                        our policy and actions in this area. The President respects the dignity of
                        other nations and insists that US policy reflect this as well as the dignity
                        of our own nation.</p>
                    <p>2. The President recognizes that differences have arisen between us,
                        particularly on the Congo. He hopes to resolve these through joint effort
                        and mutual restraint. He believes a positive effort on the part of both
                        governments is necessary to prevent our differences from overriding our
                        interests. But under our form of government he must take popular and
                        Congressional sentiment into full account. The extent to which developments
                        in the Near East and Africa have stirred popular concern is clearly
                        demonstrated in the recent effort in the House of Representatives to limit
                        the President's authority over foreign aid. The President is determined to
                        oppose this limitation. Clearly the actions of the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and the statements of its leaders can be major factors in
                        determining the outcome of the Administration's efforts with the
                        Congress.</p>
                    <p>3. The Congo is the most immediate issue now facing us. The President
                        deplores the widespread misunderstanding of US motives there. He thinks that
                        while the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and US may disagree on Congo,
                        it would far better serve both our interests to help work out a political
                        settlement than to let this problem escalate to a major confrontation in
                        Africa. The President would welcome further discussions with the <gloss target="#t_UARG1">UARG</gloss> on how to resolve this thorny problem
                        which has become a major obstacle to our bilateral relations.</p>
                    <p>4. If <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> raises the question of
                        future aid, you may say that in your discussions in Washington you found
                        hope that US/<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> relations would improve to
                        permit the continuation of our cooperation. The President thinks that
                        American actions of the last four years show the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>'s keen interest in helping the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> grow and prosper. He is sincere <pb n="283" xml:id="pg_283" facs="0315"/>in his hope that we can resolve the differences which have
                        arisen over the Congo and other matters and turn our attention to better
                        understanding of each other's problems and further consolidation of our
                        relationship.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Problem</p>
                    <p>During 1964 we have been trying to maintain an even keel in our Near East
                        relations in the backwash of Arab reaction to Israel's completion of its
                        Jordan River diversion project. The Arabs have equated the diversion with
                        the establishment of the State of Israel in Arab territory and <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> has used their emotional reaction to
                        forge a solidarity, the duration of which will be central to our problems in
                        the area in the years ahead. How the West meets the force of Arab
                        Nationalist solidarity can be a factor in whether it is consolidated or
                        diffused. How the United States meets its challenges will in part determine
                        whether the trend will be to a polarization that would identify us wholly
                        with Israel and unite the Arabs in alliance with the Soviets and Chicoms
                        against us.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">A Strategy for the Years Ahead</p>
                    <p>We need to engage in a series of complex operations to reduce the threat to
                        our major interests and avert the danger of polarization in the area by:</p>
                    <p>(a) Using our diplomatic, political, economic and military power to maintain
                        the best possible bilateral relations with all area states and to avoid a
                        confrontation with “radical” Arab states so long as they avoid damaging our
                        major interests.</p>
                    <p>(b) Encouraging social, economic and political reform and affording an
                        alternative to Soviet economic support and military supply using, where
                        necessary, highly selective military sales, to prevent a Soviet monopoly on
                        arms supply to the Arabs.</p>
                    <p>(c) Persuading the Israelis that controlled Western sales to the Arabs,
                        though painful for Israel to watch, will enhance the prospects of peace in
                        the area.</p>
                    <p>(d) Renewing endeavors in the United Nations and directly with the parties to
                        the dispute over Palestine to develop a trend toward eventual acceptance of
                        Israel as a Near Eastern state.</p>
                    <p>Detailed recommendations appear below.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Situation</p>
                    <p>(a) Having sensibly eschewed war as an immediate riposte to the Israeli water
                        works, the Arab states have for the time being come together to sponsor and
                        finance (1) Arab diversion works in Syria and prospectively in Lebanon and
                        Jordan to deny to Israel much of the flow from the sources of the Jordan
                        River; (2) a Unified Arab Command, ostensibly to protect Arab soil from
                        Israeli aggression (preemptive or punitive attacks) against Arab water
                        works; (3) the Palestine Liberation Organization, to stir up Palestine
                        refugee pressure to return to old homesteads now in Israel; and (4) unified
                        Arab diplomatic and economic pressures against Israel, including the boycott
                        of foreign firms doing business with Israel.</p>
                    <pb n="285" xml:id="pg_285" facs="0317"/>
                    <p>(b) The united Arab front against Israel has so far survived for 12 months
                        and shows signs of continuing, because of fear of Israel and because
                        currently high—and still growing—oil revenues permit relatively easy
                        financing of Arab schemes mainly by such states as Kuwait (which sees such
                        payments as a way of buying into the club of independent Arab states), Iraq,
                        Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Libya, etc. How long this pattern of united action will
                        remain dominant is a central question. Already there are signs that the
                        usual divisions may re-emerge. Kuwait and some others have given indications
                        of tiring of the heavy assessments, and some inter-Arab disputes (as in the
                        Yemen) have reintensified.</p>
                    <p>(c) All our estimates continue to show Israel as maintaining its military
                        superiority over the Arab states for the foreseeable future. Nonetheless,
                        the arms race goes on. Israel is increasing its conventional weaponry,
                        probably is getting French <gloss target="#t_SSM1">SSM</gloss>'s, and may be
                        exploring nuclears. The U.A.R. is obtaining more and better Soviet
                        conventional equipment and is experimenting (not so far very successfully)
                        with home-made missiles. Iraq and Syria are getting Soviet-made conventional
                        arms. Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, and particularly Jordan are requesting new U.S.
                        weaponry, including supersonic fighters, to be paid for in the latter cases
                        by <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> funds.</p>
                    <p>(d) Israel's security anxieties are increasing rapidly because of the threats
                        inherent in a united Arab front, the growing military strength of Arab
                        countries, Arab diversion works which in time could cut off important water
                        supplies to Israel, and more activist postures by Syria and Jordan along
                        Israel's borders and by political organizers among the Arab refugees. Israel
                        has grown increasingly firm and even provocative in border patrolling, and
                        the number of military incidents along its borders is rising. Responsible
                        Israelis do not now rule out the possibility of preemptive or punitive
                        strike against Arab targets.</p>
                    <p>(e) The Soviet Union, apparently envisaging new opportunities in the strongly
                        anti-Israeli stance of all Arabs and anti-“imperialist” stance of some
                        Arabs, and possibly goaded by Chicom rivalry, is stepping up its activities
                        in the Arab world. In the past year the U.A.R. has obtained new military
                        hardware and a new pledge of $280 million economic loans from the Soviet
                        Union, promise of a $60 million loan from Communist China, and a $100
                        million loan from Kuwait. In contrast, the U.S. has offered no military
                        assistance, made no economic development loan since 1963, maintained a small
                        ($2.3 million) technical assistance program, and remained committed to the
                        third and final year of a 1962 PL–480 agreement.</p>
                    <p>(f) The U.A.R. is involved not only with other Arab states vis-a-vis Israel,
                        but also directly in the Congo problem and certain other “liberation
                        movement” situations. In most if not all of these, our objectives <pb n="286" xml:id="pg_286" facs="0318"/>are in conflict. In other
                        situations, however (e.g., the Chase Manhattan boycott, certain issues in
                        the non-aligned conference, etc.), U.A.R. efforts have helped us against
                        other radical states.</p>
                    <p>(g) By cutting off PL–480 commodities from the U.A.R., the U.S. could hurt
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> but probably not topple
                        him (and, in any case, no visible prospective successor looks better). It
                        would also set in train an Aswan-like reaction by <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> leading to such punitive actions as
                        cancellation of our MATs and commercial airline rights, inspection of
                        vessels transiting the Suez for radioactive hazards, stepped-up pressure
                        against the Wheelus base agreement, removal of <gloss target="#t_UNEF1">UNEF</gloss> from Egyptian soil with the consequent threat to the
                        Israeli port of Eilath and of a direct Israeli-U.A.R. military
                        confrontation, further stirring up of other Arab states against Israel,
                        etc.</p>
                    <p>(h) Many of our friends and most of our opponents would like to force the
                        U.S. into actions that would tend to polarize the Near East. So would some
                        Americans.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Stakes</p>
                    <p>Our major interests in the Near East are:</p>
                    <p>(a) The maintenance of peace, to preserve the freedom and integrity of Israel
                        and the other states in the region. (cf: JFK statement 5/8/63)</p>
                    <p>(b) Ready access to and transit through the area by air, sea or land.</p>
                    <p>(c) Continued availability of oil and its economic movement to Europe.</p>
                    <p>(d) Denial of any part of the area to Communist-state control.</p>
                    <p>(e) Economic growth and political stabilization to increase the prospects of
                        independence and stability.</p>
                    <p>The defense of these major interests (particularly the first four) is our
                        central concern.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Policy Considerations</p>
                    <p>I believe the following are pertinent:</p>
                    <p>(a) Over the past years, none of our major interests have been damaged. We
                        have dealt with lesser problems within the framework of our flexible
                        bilateral relations with all states in the area. We must continue this.</p>
                    <p>(b) We cannot permit any state to challenge a basic interest without opposing
                        it vigorously. If we cannot with dignity avoid a confrontation with the
                        U.A.R., it has the power in the area to attack our special positions and to
                        mobilize most if not all other Arabs into an anti-Israel front, thus
                        effecting polarization since the Soviets would exploit the opportunity to
                        give all-out support to the Arabs against Israel, “the beachhead of western
                        imperialism in the Arab East.” Saudi Arabia might be in a position to
                        maintain useful relations with us, but Jordan <pb n="287" xml:id="pg_287" facs="0319"/>probably would have to follow the Arab Nationalist line or
                        the regime would succumb to internal and external pressures that could be
                        mounted from Cairo.</p>
                    <p>(c) Assuming, however, that we can maintain tolerable relations with Cairo,
                        there is the possibility of continuing the strengthening of the regimes and
                        capabilities of Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and Lebanon. In addition, we could and
                        should continue to compete with the Soviets in the U.A.R., Syria, and Iraq
                        by offering alternatives to full dependence on the Soviets. This would
                        involve continued “Food for Peace” programs and a willingness, in the case
                        of Jordan, Lebanon and Saudi Arabia, to sell military equipment up to the
                        minimum levels being insisted upon and financed by the <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>(d) Although Israel may in fact understand that U.S. military deliveries to
                        Arab states participating in the <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> buildup
                        is the least disadvantageous of alternatives at hand, vigorous high-level
                        efforts will be required to persuade Israel's friends in this country that
                        such a course (1) gives us a restraining hand on the amounts and types of
                        equipment made available to these states; (2) prevents the introduction of
                        Soviet equipment and Soviet or Syrian/Egyptian/Iraq trainers and technicians
                        along the long frontier with Jordan; (3) loosens the “radical” Arabs'
                        otherwise total grip on the <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss>, thus
                        strengthening and speeding the prospects of a splintering of the support for
                        the <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Continuing strong high-level efforts will be required to resist pressures for
                        compensating U.S. sales to Israel which would polarize the Near East to both
                        Israel's and our disadvantage.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendations</p>
                    <p>A. That we actively and aggressively seek to resolve policy differences with
                        the U.A.R. while carrying forward on our present PL–480 commitments and
                        holding out the carrot of a new agreement for a further period. Should we be
                        able to arrive at an acceptable political compromise on the Congo, limited
                        economic development lending would be considered.</p>
                    <p>B. That we proceed to discussions of the Jordanian military shopping list
                        along the general lines of a 5-year, $55 million ground equipment program
                        and a major effort to persuade Hussain to purchase the supersonic aircraft
                        he insists he needs from some Western European supplier—with the fallback
                        that we will consider the sale and delivery of one squadron of U.S. planes
                        as early as 1968 (after pilot training and construction of airfield for
                        jets) as a last resort to prevent his taking <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>s.</p>
                    <p>C. That we inform Israel of the move we intend to make and seek to abort its
                        strong adverse reaction with the argumentation developed above.</p>

                    <p>[Here follows a brief discussion of Vietnam.]</p>
                    <p>Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>: Reviewed the
                        problem of military assistance to Jordan. The Arab States are jointly trying
                        to purchase arms abroad. Kuwait is funding the purchases. The United Arab
                        Command has set force goals for Jordan. These include M–48 tanks and
                        supersonic aircraft. Jordan, as a member of the Arab club, must purchase
                        additional equipment somewhere—if not from us, then from the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. The supersonic jets Jordan wants to buy
                        are not defensive weapons—therefore it is difficult for us to provide
                        them.</p>
                    <p>There is no good solution to this problem and there are disadvantages from
                        every course of action. If we say no to the supersonics, Jordan will ask
                        Soviet aid. If we say yes, Israel will demand supersonics. Thus, no matter
                        what we do, we will be contributing to the arms race in the Middle East
                        which we have been trying to damp down. If necessary and as a last resort,
                        we will have to give the supersonics, but we should first try to get Jordan
                        to buy them from a European supplier. The decision in the Jordan case is a
                        major one involving all the Middle East.</p>
                    <p>Acting Defense Secretary Vance: The Jordan request is indeed thorny. The
                        Jordanians ask for M–48A3 tanks because the Israelis are getting them. They
                        ask for F–104Gs, an up-to-date jet, rather than the F–104C or the F–104D
                        which are antiquated planes.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName>: The United Arab
                        Command already has superjets. If we add 20 supersonic planes to the Jordan
                        force, the Arab-Israeli balance will not be upset. Libya and Saudi Arabia
                        already have supersonics. The addition of these planes to the Jordanian
                        force is not of great importance.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> Director <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName>: Jordan will get supersonics either from us, from the
                        Europeans or from the Soviets. The price of our not supplying them is too
                        high to pay.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">McGeorge Bundy</persName>: Either way the
                        request is dealt with will end up being disagreeable for us. We should avoid
                        giving Jordan supersonics if possible because the resulting Israeli pressure
                        on us will be very great. However, we must make some arms deal with Jordan
                        and do so before they decide to go to the Russians. We could agree not to
                        give them supersonics now but review the decision again if they insist.</p>
                    <p>Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName>: Our reply
                        to Jordanian King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> has already
                        been delayed. I will be leaving Wednesday from Washington and be talking
                        with <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> in Amman on
                        Saturday.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">McGeorge Bundy</persName>: We have already
                        informed Israel of the Jordanian request and we will discuss with them the
                        decision we reach.</p>
                    <p>Secretary Dillon: We should not feel badly about an arms race in the Middle
                        East because it is going on and we cannot control it.</p>
                    <p>Acting Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>: Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> shares all our concerns about
                        this request but he believes we should play out the negotiations until it is
                        certain there is no alternative and then decide to give the supersonics.
                        Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> should
                        press as hard as possible for some other solution but at the end of the
                        road, he should refer back to Washington and at that time we would decide to
                        go ahead.</p>
                    <p>If we agreed to give the supersonics, deliveries could be scheduled for
                        1968–1970. The planes would thus be under our control for a period. The
                        Jordanians would be dependent on us for replacements and spares.</p>
                    <p>If the Jordanians do go to the Soviets and obtain supersonics, then the
                        Israelis will be surrounded by countries having Soviet-supplied aircraft.
                        The addition of a Soviet presence in Jordan would be serious, especially
                        during difficulties which may arise from the diversion by Jordan of water
                        flowing to Israel.</p>
                    <p>Acting Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName>: Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s view is that we
                        should provide A–3 planes, 20 supersonics—104C and 104D—if the Jordanians
                        cannot buy their planes in Western Europe.</p>
                    <p>The President: There is no problem in providing Jordan with the tanks they
                        request. They should be told to buy their supersonic planes in Europe. If
                        they do not wish to do so, then Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> should cable us to this effect and await our reply.
                        He should stay in Amman if it appears that the King is about to break off
                        negotiations with us.</p>
                    <p>Acting Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>: The King can't
                        resist the domestic pressure he is getting. There have been attempts on his
                        life. Recently he moved toward closer relations with the Arab states in
                        order to gain personal security and security for his country. He could not
                        break with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> even if he wanted
                        to. If he does not break with us, how can he get the armaments the other
                        Arab states are demanding he obtain?</p>
                    <pb n="290" xml:id="pg_290" facs="0322"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName>: Jordan gets budgetary
                        support of $46,000,000 annually from the United States. The purchase of arms
                        by Jordan is considered a grant in aid by some people. This is not so but
                        many will see our sale of arms to Jordan as giving a belligerent neighbor
                        arms to attack Israel.</p>
                    <p>Every effort should be made to persuade Jordan to buy planes from France. We
                        should also put pressure on <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> to
                        stop pushing King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> so hard. We
                        should threaten to withdraw our budgetary support of Jordan. This would have
                        the effect of raising the cost of the planes to Jordan. No decision should
                        be made until we have carried out these proposed actions.</p>
                    <p>Robert <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName>: We should try out the
                        hard line on <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>, not mentioning
                        the supersonic planes in the beginning. Then if he insists, we should fall
                        back and regroup, thus giving us more time before a final decision has to be
                        made. King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> is not going to
                        jump the reservation at once. In trying to save <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> we may kill him. If we sell the planes to <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>, then we will have to provide them
                        to Israel. If this happens, <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
                        could say that <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> was a bad
                        Arab. We should take this in two bites and only sell the planes if the
                        Soviets make a firm offer to do so.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">McGeorge Bundy</persName>: If we warn <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> that U.S. budgetary support may be
                        in doubt if he makes a deal with the Russians, the King would not be in a
                        great hurry to make a Soviet deal.</p>
                    <p>Acting Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>: It is not
                        necessary to reach a final decision tonight. When Assistant Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> reports back on his talk
                        with King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>, we will know much
                        more and can then decide what to do.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName>: It is not likely
                        that France would sell Mirages to the Jordanians.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">McGeorge Bundy</persName>: We could try to
                        overcome French opposition to a sale to Jordan.</p>
                    <p>Vice President <persName corresp="#p_HHHJ1">Humphrey</persName>: In the light
                        of developments in the Congo and in Egypt, if Jordan breaks with us, there
                        may be a very serious reaction on the Hill. The AID bill would be seriously
                        affected. King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> is on the U.S.
                        dole. If we sell him supersonic planes, we will have all hell to pay. The
                        sale of modern tanks we could possibly get away with but the sale of
                        supersonics would create an impossible situation.</p>
                    <p>The President: We all agree that Jordan will get the planes from the Russians
                        if they do not get them from us.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> Director Rowan: Either way we move we
                        face serious difficulties. In a showdown and as a last resort, we will have
                        to go ahead with the sale of supersonics.</p>

                        drawing on following presentation:</p>
                    <p>As Prime Minister aware, <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> over past six
                        months has been pondering painful dilemmas posed by Jordan's request to buy
                        arms, using funds made available by Unified Arab Command. Jordan has
                        resisted heavy pressure from the <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> to
                        acquire Soviet equipment, against arguments stressing merits of
                        standardization military equipment among Egypt, Syria, Iraq, and Jordan, by
                        assessing that it can <pb n="292" xml:id="pg_292" facs="0324"/>and prefers
                        to depend on Western sources of supply. Jordan has also refused agree to
                        positioning of non-Jordanian <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> forces in
                        Jordan except in time of war. If we refuse now to supply arms, particularly
                        armor and aircraft, almost inevitably Jordan will acquire Soviet equipment
                        with <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> military trainers with all the
                        dangers that entails.</p>
                    <p>Our assessment is that even if US-Jordan relations are put on the line to
                        prevent arms acquisition, <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>
                        will feel he has no alternative but to accept <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> decision to modernize and expand his forces. Aside from his
                        “image” in Arab World which would be impaired if he abandoned Arab ranks for
                        Western subsidies, his own armed forces would not accept such an outcome. We
                        believe that although <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>
                        recognizes that acceptance of the Soviet/<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                        alternative could be beginning of end for his regime, he would do it rather
                        than take immediate consequences of isolation from rest of Arab world.</p>
                    <p>We have reached conclusion that some positive response to Jordan's request is
                        necessary to avoid disastrous confrontation with <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> which would be strengthened, not weakened, by our refusal
                        sell equipment to Jordan. Prime Minister will realize that <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> objective of improving Arab military
                        posture relative to Israel makes our dilemma especially painful. However,
                        positive <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> response less disadvantageous
                        than other possible alternatives.</p>
                    <p>Our strategy seeks to hold Jordan's arms purchases to minimum necessary
                        enable <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> withstand <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> pressures, and to space deliveries so that
                        there will be no unacceptable rapid arms build-up in Jordan. By avoiding
                        confrontation with <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss>, time may well permit
                        divisive Arab forces to effect the weakening or destruction of <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> and policy of diverting sorely needed
                        resources to arms.</p>
                    <p>Jordan has requested <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> sell <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> approximately $90 million equipment
                        including modern tanks and supersonic aircraft. Planned use ground equipment
                        includes modernization <gloss target="#t_JAA1">JAA</gloss> and creation five
                        new brigades. Latter will be manned by approximately 8500 men in existing
                        National Guard and 6000 to 7000 new recruits. On air side, King seeks to
                        purchase one 20 plane squadron of F–104G fighters.</p>
                    <p>After months of exhaustive study, we have decided inform King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> in next few days of our willingness
                        sell for cash ground equipment to be delivered over calendar years 1965–1969
                        inclusive which prices out at about $50 million. We are prepared extend
                        credit not to exceed $7 million at any time. We will seek to hold tanks to
                        M–48s on grounds of cost and to phase deliveries through period.</p>
                    <p>On supersonics we will seek to dissuade <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> from acquisition any supersonics this juncture, but
                        frankly we not likely succeed. We will inform Hussein that if he convinced
                        no alternative to acquisition, we unwilling sell American aircraft and could
                        not countenance Soviet <pb n="293" xml:id="pg_293" facs="0325"/>
                        <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss> 21s. We will urge Jordan purchase
                        supersonics in West Europe. Supersonic squadron cannot be operational until
                        1968 to 1969 at earliest.</p>
                    <p>In reaching our decisions, we have had ever in mind requirements of Israeli
                        security. Planned Arab buildup will not threaten existing Israeli over-all
                        military superiority over Arabs for foreseeable future. We are confident
                        Israel will agree USG decision is least unattractive alternative from
                        viewpoint both American and Israeli interests.</p>
                    <p>You should inform <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> we distressed
                        that, contrary to Israel's assurances about ability maintain secrecy M–48A3
                        tank transaction 2–3 years, entire transaction known to Arabs and to large
                        segments general public. He will appreciate under circumstances and in order
                        mitigate political repercussions in Arab world, we compelled either 1)
                        invoke security clause to cancel conversion kit procurement agreement or 2)
                        respond favorably to Jordanian request for similar tanks.</p>
                    <p>We are disturbed at continued press campaign about alleged role Cubic
                        Corporation in <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> rocket program and hiring
                        of German technicians from Litton subsidiaries. Given the Secretary's
                        assurances that allegations about Cubic clearly distortion, we cannot escape
                        conclusion continuing press campaign has tacit approval <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> and stimulated by Israeli leaks. We hope
                        Israel can take effective steps end further sterile and misleading

                        since I had recently returned from Washington. I made small talk about the
                        inauguration, snow, et cetera, mentioned that I had talked with a great many
                        people both in the Executive Branch and the Congress including Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>. I stated my principal
                        meeting with President Johnson had unfortunately not developed due to his
                        illness although it had been carefully scheduled for my last day in
                        Washington. I stated that I had since received instructions and wanted to
                        make several comments based on my talks and the instruction I had received
                        from Washington. I then spoke as follows:</p>
                    <p>Our President and indeed everyone I talked with are very hopeful of
                        maintaining good relations with the United Arab Republic if possible. We
                        have a deep interest in a strong, independent, and prosperous Egypt. We also
                        share major interests in the independence and strengthening of the Near
                        Eastern States. We will continue to work for constructive relations with all
                        these States and for impartiality in our policy and actions in the Middle
                        Eastern area. The President respects the dignity of other nations and
                        insists that US policy reflect this as well as the dignity of our own
                        country.</p>
                    <p>At this point the President interrupted me and referred to the December 23
                        speech in a slightly embarrassed manner. He seemed to want to remove the
                        speech from our relationship but without admission of error. He stated
                        nothing personal was intended and that the report of the Stino conversation
                        that he had received had indicated aid was conditioned on Egyptian manners
                        and behavior. I said nothing of this sort was intended. I suggested we put
                        the several incidents of the past behind us and look to the future
                        hopefully. He stated we would do this but we must deal with the incident. He
                        then spoke not about the speech but about aid, expressing gratitude for it
                        and the hope that it would continue but with the expressed requirement that
                        the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> be independent in its actions.</p>
                    <pb n="295" xml:id="pg_295" facs="0327"/>
                    <p>I then continued stating as follows:</p>
                    <p>The President recognizes that differences have arisen between us particularly
                        in the Congo. He hopes to resolve these differences by joint effort and
                        mutual restraint. He believes that a positive effort on the part of both
                        governments is necessary to prevent our differences from overriding our
                        interests. The Congo is the most immediate issue now facing us. The
                        President deplores the widespread misunderstanding of US motives there. He
                        thinks that while the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and the US may
                        disagree it would far better serve both our interests to help work out a
                        political settlement than to let this problem escalate to a major
                        confrontation in Africa. The President would welcome further discussions
                        with the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> on how to resolve this problem
                        which has become a major obstacle in our bilateral relations. If <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> agrees we would welcome any
                        suggestions as to the form and place of any further talks. President
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> nodded but made no
                        comment. I continued, stating that under our form of government popular and
                        Congressional sentiment must be taken into account. The extent to which
                        developments in Africa and the Near East have stirred popular concern is
                        clearly demonstrated in the recent effort in the House of Representatives to
                        limit the President's authority on foreign aid. The President is determined
                        to oppose this limitation. I then stated I would like to be sure that
                        President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> understood the
                        situation within the Congress on this matter. I explained the nature of the
                        amendment within the House. The fact that House action was not a final
                        decision and that even as we spoke Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> was testifying in an effort to remove the limitation
                        placed by the House. I stressed the delicacy of the situation and expressed
                        the hope that the administration would succeed in its effort.</p>
                    <p>At this point the President returned to a reference at the December 23
                        speech. He said he had feared for some time there would be a cutoff of aid
                        and that his speech was really the consequence of a cumulative effect of
                        many concerns and statements. He threw up his hands and said “those speeches
                        every year by your Congress and your press”. I said we had had some of the
                        same problem here with respect to the press in the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>He said, “it is much better now than it was five or six years ago but you may
                        not believe it”. I said I had few complaints recently but that we had had
                        difficulty during the first weeks of my stay here.</p>
                    <p>He then said “and I read all these articles by the correspondents.” He
                        referred to a Hedrick Smith article (although not mentioning him by name)
                        which stated that “<persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> himself had
                        called off the press in an effort to prevent interference with Congressional
                        action at this sensitive time.” He said “this just isn't true”.</p>
                    <p>I then suggested that we talk for a moment about our major problem the Congo.
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> said he had suggested to
                        Gbenye that his Foreign <pb n="296" xml:id="pg_296" facs="0328"/>Minister
                        get in touch with the US, <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, and French
                        Embassies in Cairo and meet with them. I said, “to what purpose?” He
                        replied, “I believe that if you talk with him some of your concerns will be
                        removed.” I stated that our policy was to support the Central Government of
                        the Congo in accordance with the policy we had consistently followed and in
                        accordance with various resolutions of the United Nations. He made no
                        comment. I said I thought it important that we remove this problem from the
                        military arena and seek a political solution. I pointed out that there were
                        several steps coming up that gave flexibility to the situation—the Congo
                        elections, the sub-committee's travels, the Foreign Ministers meeting, etc.,
                        and hoped that there would be a new initiative which would offer hope. He
                        made no comment. I asked him point blank whether he could see hope for an
                            <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> initiative in the context of the
                        present and forthcoming situation. He said, “if you could remove Tshombe it
                        would help.” I referred to our last conversation and stated that we had not
                        put Tshombe in; we could not take him out; and that we support the
                        legitimate Government of the Congo where the problems are larger than any
                        one personality. He then said we could tell Kasavubu to get rid of Tshombe.
                        I said “we do not control the Central Government of the Congo any more than
                        you control the rebels. It is a legitimate government and we must respect
                        its status.” He said that someone other than Tshombe should be elected. I
                        said this is up to the Congolese. They must decide. He waved his hands as
                        though this could be taken care of with little difficulty.</p>
                    <p>There was then a pause after which I asked him if I might ask him the
                        significance of the closing of the GDRC Embassy which I had noted in the
                        press and which had followed Gbenye's press conference stating that the
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> gave him full support. He said that
                        the answer is that he did not know it was still here. “I thought it was
                        closed at the same time our Embassy was closed in Leopoldville and it was
                        not until Gbenye mentioned that I was aware it still existed here.” We both
                        laughed very heartily at this point and he said, “the analysts will have a
                        good time with that one.” He stated that if Tshombe could be removed it
                        would make it easier for <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and others
                        aiding the rebels to withdraw support.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> alluded in a vague
                        way to a Spaak-Gbenye meeting about two months ago in which Spaak had
                        suggested some form of coalition government which Gbenye had rejected. He
                        also referred to a meeting between Gbenye's Foreign Minister Kanza and
                        Attwood and to a proposal made by our Ambassador to Dar-es-Salaam. He made
                        no comment on these proposals but referred to them as among the many things
                        that had been suggested.</p>
                    <p>I returned to the Congo and stated again that we were flexible as long as the
                        legitimate Congo Government was respected and we hoped <pb n="297" xml:id="pg_297" facs="0329"/>for a political solution in an <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> context and I hoped he had the same
                        flexibility and would assist us in achieving some solution to the problem.
                        He nodded but was most noncommittal. I expressed the hope for further talks
                        either with members of the government or between the two of us. He nodded to
                        both suggestions and made no specific response.</p>
                    <p>The meeting ended most warmly. President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> stated he hoped I was enjoying Cairo. I stated I had
                        been fairly busy and laughed. He also laughed and said he hoped things would
                        quiet down for us. End of conversation.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Comments:</p>
                    <p>At no time did he directly mention aid except as noted. It is interesting
                        that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> told the British
                        Ambassador yesterday that the <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> had
                        “failed.” He never got to this point with me although I led him into a
                        discussion of the <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> several times. He
                        seemed to want to dodge direct discussion of <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> activities and, when I mentioned the subcommittee visit to
                        Leopoldville, Brazzaville and Burundi, he appeared to have no knowledge of
                        the trip.</p>
                    <p>I had the impression that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> has
                        no sense of direction re Congo. He may be open to concrete suggestion
                        provided there is a clear face saver for him, but he does not see his way
                        out at this point.</p>

                    <p>Acting Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> called
                        the President at 8:20 p.m. on February 3, 1965, to tell him that the Senate
                        had voted 44 to 38 to give the President the discretion <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> had requested for P.L. 480 sales to the
                        United Arab Republic. (See <ref target="#d127">Document 127</ref>.)
                        According to notes of the conversation prepared in <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>'s office, after some discussion of the
                        vote in the Senate, the President told <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> “not to let Talbot go and make any deal.” He stressed
                        that <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> should not make any
                        agreement, declaring, “This is a very explosive thing. We can never get
                        anything in the Congress again unless we are careful. That foreign aid of
                        forty to fifty million every year that runs to half a billion total, the
                        King should think twice about.” He told <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> to be sure to tell <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> to hold the line. (Johnson Library, <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> Papers, Jordan)</p>
                    <p>At 5:05 p.m. on February 4, <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>
                        talked on the telephone to <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Myer

                        modified so that <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> was not <pb n="298" xml:id="pg_298" facs="0330"/>authorized to make any agreement.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> told <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> that <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> had authorization to make an offer on ground material
                        including some tanks. <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> said his
                        understanding was that the President was concerned about even that and asked
                        that when <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> saw the President he
                        should tell him <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> was writing a

                        should simply explore the situation and report back. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> replied that he would tell the
                        President about <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName>'s feelings and
                        that a meeting in the morning might be in order. (Ibid.)</p>

                        fresh review, I have focussed on Jordan arms question in morning discussion
                        here today with Ambassadors <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Barbour</persName>,
                            <persName>Barnes</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BLD2">Battle</persName>, Cottam, Hart, <persName corresp="#p_KRB1">Knight</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MAH1">Meyer</persName> and
                        Strong. <persName corresp="#p_SPOA1">Solbert</persName> and Bunte also
                        present.</p>
                    <p>Views expressed by all Ambassadors reflected sober concern that protection
                        and promotion of U.S. interests in Near East becoming increasingly difficult
                        as Arab-Israel conflict moves toward what some of them believe could be
                        early climactic stage. All agreed that Jordan arms question can be
                        approached effectively only in context of current Arab drive for unified
                        political and military actions, symptoms of which are tensions over
                        diversions of Jordan waters, Palestine refugee emotions, incidents on
                        Israeli borders with Syria and Jordan, publicity on German-Israeli arms
                        arrangements, etc.</p>
                    <p>Each Ambassador present expressed belief our interests in Near East best
                        served by proceeding with Jordan arms offer. Differences centered on such
                        questions as speed with which transaction should be <pb n="299" xml:id="pg_299" facs="0331"/>concluded, inclusion of U.S. supersonics in
                        offer, and open sales policy to Israel and other countries in region.</p>
                    <p> Hart, Strong, and <persName corresp="#p_BLD2">Battle</persName> urged we
                        should play for time in hope other and more moderating influences could be
                        brought to bear on situation. <persName corresp="#p_MAH1">Meyer</persName>
                        also felt this a possible course. Hart argued arms race will continue
                        whether or not we block entry of Soviet arms into Jordan and we might as
                        well stay in the picture because when Arabs and Israelis fight, we will in
                        any case have to move in to stop them. He thought if we sold F–5s to Saudi
                        Arabia, this would encourage Jordan to look at F–5s instead of F–104s and
                        thus slightly reduce sensitivity of supersonic issue. Barnes agreed.</p>
                    <p> Strong was persuaded we could not look with equanimity on early clash
                        between Arabs and Israelis. Impossible to see consequences of such a clash,
                        he pointed out; our remaining friends in Arab world might well be undermined
                        or destroyed in process. He urged that as monarchs are strong force for
                        moderation, we should keep trying to bolster them. He saw other key in area
                        as <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> and <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> with whom he saw no alternative in interests of peace to
                        trying to get back into a better relationship. If rapprochement with Nasser
                        should fail, he felt, Near East bound to go into more difficult crises. If
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> is interested in moving
                        toward rapprochement with U.S. he may not wish press for early conclusion on
                        supersonics for Jordan. Strong concluded we should play out our hand with
                            <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> by being forthcoming on
                        ground equipment but difficult on question of supersonic aircraft. He would
                        not like to see U.S. aircraft involved in deal because that would open up
                        U.S. arsenals to Israelis who now have twice used air attacks against Arabs
                        and may see air action as most economical and useful military instrument in
                        future.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BLD2">Battle</persName>, agreeing we should
                        offer arms to Jordan to block Arab standardization on Soviet equipment,
                        urged that we try to delay <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>
                        trip to Cairo, now tentatively scheduled for next week, until he was
                        persuaded to make careful investigation of Western European sources of
                        supersonic aircraft. Without much optimism, <persName corresp="#p_BLD2">Battle</persName> hoped we could avoid a crunch with Jordan until
                        several of our political Congressional difficulties with the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> have become more manageable. In the end he
                        would offer U.S. aircraft to <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>
                        to preempt Soviet-<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> entry there.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MAH1">Meyer</persName> suggested that in
                        view of difficulties of maintaining arms sales restraint in face of easy
                        accessibility to other arms sources by both sides, we should permit military
                        sales to any purchaser. He has found the Arabs talking much as they did in
                        the 1950's and has seen emotions and unrealism building up to dangerous
                        levels. Therefore he questioned whether we need exhaust ourselves in efforts
                        to postpone a confrontation. Perhaps an early bloodletting would not <pb n="300" xml:id="pg_300" facs="0332"/>be too bad an alternative,
                        especially as a clash several years hence could easily involve larger forces
                        and more sophisticated equipment. In any case conflict now hopefully limited
                        could precipitate on intervention to deal with root problem of Jordan waters
                        which has taken Palestine issue out of icebox. To him the alternative would
                        be to continue playing for time, mainly in the hope that Arab unity would
                        break up once again.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Barbour</persName> agreed that the
                        policy of general arms restraint makes little sense now because of
                        relatively easy availability of arms elsewhere and breaches already made. He
                        also doubted that “even-handedness” can be considered a viable policy, in
                        part because we never had been as close to Arab states as to Israel and in
                        part because he felt chances of maintaining peace might be improved by
                        making certain all parties knew U.S. would not permit Arab attacks on
                        Israel. On assumption Arabs would depend on Soviet backing in any military
                        adventure, he believed Arab aggression would collapse if, as seemed most
                        likely, Soviets should demonstrate they would not face confrontation with
                        U.S. in Near East. As a tactic to meet the immediate situation, he would
                        provide U.S. arms including supersonics as a fallback to Jordan on the basis
                        of also making open arms sales including aircraft to Israel. <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Barbour</persName> also was inclined to believe that
                        Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName>'s reaction to
                        the Jordan arms proposal, although firm and serious, reflected less concern
                        over this aspect than she had shown about Syrian and Lebanese programs to
                        divert the headwaters of the Jordan. However, in view Harman's immediate
                        approach to <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> it appears <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> position has hardened following subsequent
                        talks with <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador Cottam believed that offering arms including supersonics to Jordan
                        at present time represented an essential step up protection of our interests
                        in Near East, but to make our relations with Arab states satisfactory we
                        would need to go beyond this. We should find better ways to take account of
                        and adjust to modernization and doctrines of liberation, unity, and
                        socialism, fueled by anti-Zionism and anti-imperialism.</p>
                    <p>Ambassadors <persName corresp="#p_KRB1">Knight</persName> and
                            <persName>Barnes</persName> questioned whether we still have latitude in
                        area necessary to pursue tactics suggested by some of their colleagues.
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KRB1">Knight</persName> felt with passage
                        of time we had lost several options open to us two or three years ago and
                        our major failure in these years of relative quiet had been our inability to
                        persuade Israel to give up its hard line “fortress Israel” concept and to
                        seek accommodation with the eastern Arabs. He estimated that we have now
                        moved so far to final confrontation between the Arabs and Israelis that
                        “even-handedness” policies are probably no longer useful. He thought we
                        might better restrain the forces leading toward an explosion <pb n="301" xml:id="pg_301" facs="0333"/>by a policy of open military sales to all
                        parties and of making fully clear where U.S. stands in case of conflict.
                        While unfortunate, he thought we should deal with situation as it is shaping
                        up and not as we would have preferred it. On Jordan, he felt strongly that
                        we should go the whole way to save <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> from going the Soviet arms route and to keep on our
                        side only truly friendly state in area that adjoins Israel.</p>
                    <p>In his opinion, we should bend over backwards to meet the problems caused by
                        the provision of supersonic aircraft to Jordan because he is convinced our
                        offer will get nowhere without supersonics.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Barnes</persName> expressed view that U.S. arms package
                        as currently constituted could not meet King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>'s needs. On question of likelihood of <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> and <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> accepting Western European supersonics for Jordan,
                            <persName>Barnes</persName> believes Hussein not favorably inclined
                        toward Mirages. <persName corresp="#p_BRG1">Barnes</persName> further
                        believes Western European supersonics will not in eyes of <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> match <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>s
                        or F–104s both in terms of performance and his present understanding of
                        French financial terms. There are some rumors in Beirut of a possible
                        Saudi-Lebanese-Jordanian joint purchase of Mirages on very favorable terms.
                            <persName>Barnes</persName> feels this would cause <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> to look somewhat more favorably on
                        Western European aircraft. Hart believes it would reduce <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> influence in Saudi Arabia.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Barnes</persName> reported that <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> is scheduled to go to Cairo next week, probably
                        about February 10, for talks with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> and the <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss>.
                            <persName>Barnes</persName> estimated that without promise of U.S.
                        supersonics <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> cannot sell the
                        U.S. package in Cairo, and will not resist anticipated <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> decision that he should therefore accept
                        the proffered <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>s. Difficulty arises over
                        fact <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> considers he committed
                        himself last September to accept <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>s if he
                        could not get U.S. supersonics. In the judgment of
                            <persName>Barnes</persName>, should <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> try to resist a <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss>
                        decision that he take <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>s, he could
                        probably not stand 48 hours against a new <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> campaign labeling him
                        still a tool of imperialism who was blocking Arab plans.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador Hart asked that it not be construed that the U.S. has lost all its
                        important assets in the Arab world. Saudi Arabia, for example, has not been
                        deeply inoculated with anti-Westernism. While ready to pay for Arab
                        rearmament against Israel, Faisal is much more concerned over the intrusion
                        into the peninsula of Soviet influence, Arab socialism, and the Egyptian
                        military presence. He will himself avoid Soviet weaponry. An additional
                        reason to play for time lies in Faisal's future utility as a moderating
                        influence.</p>
                    <p>The above comments which reflect the diversity of views of our Ambassadors
                        were made after I had laid out in detail our recent agonizing policy
                        appraisals in Washington. I had described our efforts to balance the risks
                        of Soviet-<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> military presence in Jordan
                        against those of arms oscillation fueled by American sales to Israel as well
                        as <pb n="302" xml:id="pg_302" facs="0334"/>to several Arab countries, and
                        had discussed the possible consequences of polarization between Soviet-Arab
                        forces on one side and Israel and the U.S. on the other.</p>
                    <p>I had also pointed out as clearly as possible the overlapping foreign policy
                        and domestic political concerns which had been taken into account in the
                        President's instructions to me.</p>

                    <p> GWB called to report that we had had a long meeting this afternoon with the
                        President and are meeting again tomorrow.<note n="2" xml:id="d135fn2">According to the President's Daily Diary, he met with <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>, General <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName>, Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName>
                            from 3:35 to 5:05 p.m. on February 5, and with <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName>,
                                <persName corresp="#p_VJJ1">Jack Valenti</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MBD1">Bill Moyers</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName> about Jordan from 3:50 to 5:28
                            p.m. on February 6. (Ibid.)</note> The President has a natural
                        reluctance but he is now fully appreciating the considerations involved.
                        What GWB has recommended, with the support of his colleagues, is that Phil
                            (<persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName>) be authorized to offer
                        the ground package which is the ground equipment, including only the basic M
                        48, A 1 tank which has the limited armament and the gasoline engine with the
                        limited range. On supersonics he should encourage them to go to Western
                        Europe. If this doesn't wash he can come on back. This starts us down the
                        road. It seems to us that there is a serious danger the King may go on to
                        Cairo on the 10th and be persuaded to decide he is going down the other road
                        with the other people. This is about as good a plan as we have to hold the
                        line and see what develops. The <pb n="303" xml:id="pg_303" facs="0335"/>general feeling is that this will not satisfy him and this deal will not
                        be made on this basis and there will have to be further haggling. We have
                        started talking with his neighbors who are very upset. GWB sure that part of
                        their own rather vociferous anxiety is the desire to build up a case for
                        some large demands on their part. It is an unattractive situation no matter
                        how you slice it. GWB wanted to make sure the Secretary was in general
                        accord with this line.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary thought that was right. He didn't think that by going as far as
                        some of the papers indicated we ought to go to avoid the problems that we
                        will be trying to avoid that it would cure the problem. On both sides of an
                        arms race we will be building up the United Arab Command which is aimed at
                        Israel. GWB said we had come to the kind of conclusion to offer something
                        not acceptable in order to have an opportunity to talk further and see what
                        comes out. If we offer nothing we can be certain we have sent him down the
                        other road. Talk of losing the buffer state. Jernegan interrupted to mention
                        the comparison with the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> in 1955 when we
                        refused a relatively modest request for arms and within two months he
                            (<persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>) had turned around and
                        accepted a much larger Russian offer and has had a close relationship with
                        the Russians ever since.</p>
                    <p> GWB mentioned the neighbors coming (Israelis) and saying don't offer
                        anything. Then the boss comes up to the realization they are pretty smart
                        people but realizes they have their own domestic political problems.
                        Secretary mentioned they were not very objective on the PL 480 business—at
                        least not as objective as we thought they would be.</p>

                    <p>A United States inspection team visited the Dimona reactor site January 30,
                        1965. Although the ten hours spent at the site did not permit as detailed a
                        visit as desirable, the team believes there was sufficient time to determine
                        the status of activity at Dimona. Major findings (see enclosure)<note n="2" xml:id="d136fn2">The enclosure, entitled “Preliminary Draft Report on
                            Dimona Inspection Team,” unsigned and undated, is not printed.</note>
                        included:</p>
                    <p>1. The future direction of atomic energy development in Israel appears
                        uncertain because anticipated acquisition of a nuclear power and desalting
                        plant has increased Israeli interest in slightly enriched uranium fueled
                        reactors from abroad and reduced interest in developing natural uranium
                        fueled reactors in Israel.</p>
                    <p>2. While nothing suggests an early weapons development program, the Dimona
                        site has excellent development and production capability that warrants
                        continued surveillance at intervals not to exceed one year.</p>
                    <p>The team findings indicate that we can afford to accede to Prime Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>'s request that we postpone
                        the next agreed six-monthly inspection until after the parliamentary
                        elections in November this year.</p>
                    <p>We remain concerned that Israel may have succeeded in concealing a decision
                        to develop nuclear weapons. The team findings must be weighed against the
                        following facts:</p>
                    <p>1. Israel concealed the existence of the Dimona reactor from us for about two
                        years.</p>
                    <p>2. Israeli officials did not allow adequate time for thorough inspection of
                        the Dimona site and arranged no visits to sites of projected related
                        facilities.</p>
                    <pb n="305" xml:id="pg_305" facs="0337"/>
                    <p>3. Israeli officials ruled questions about procurement of uranium from abroad
                        “outside the scope of the visit” and suggested taking them up through normal
                        diplomatic channels.</p>
                    <p>4. Israel is acquiring missiles from France designed to accommodate either
                        high-explosive or nuclear warheads.</p>
                    <p>5. Public and private statements by Israeli officials suggest military
                        planning that includes the use of nuclear weapons.</p>
                    <p>Given these circumstances, we urge prompt approval of the request of the
                        Acting Secretary to the President December 18, 1964,<note n="3" xml:id="d136fn3">Not found.</note> for authority to initiate

                        from 7 to 12 brigades would transform it from defensive to offensive Army
                        under aggressive directives of <pb n="306" xml:id="pg_306" facs="0338"/>

                        policy. (3) Supply of tanks and other material to Jordan would place large
                        aggressive force only few kilometers from Tel Aviv. Israel would lose
                        capacity defense in depth. Result would be fundamental change in balance
                        strength unacceptable to Israel. Psychological blow to Israeli people no
                        less significant than military blow. (4) <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
                        must and will do everything in its power to oppose development tension in
                        Near East to all-time peak. (5) Arab countries openly preparing steal water

                        with oral presentation stressing: (1) Communication on US intentions supply
                        arms to Jordan transmitted by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Barbour</persName> took <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> by
                        surprise. Matter of gravest concern to Israel and Ambassador had been
                        assured US officials would keep in touch as matter developed. (2) Urged
                        initiation intimate and detailed consultation on highest level. Such
                        consultation had not yet taken place, but vital to security Israel. (3)
                        Supply US materiel to Jordan would change character Jordan Army from defense
                        to offense. Whole basis <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> defensive

                        concept invalid. (4) Increase in size Jordan Army with incorporation
                        National Guard largely made up of Palestinians would result in
                        Palestinianizing Jordan Army. Such development particularly dangerous view

                        development could assure survival Jordan. Enlarged Army would constitute
                        severe economic drain that would threaten Jordan's viability and
                        independence. (7) Impact on public opinion in Israel would be severe. (8)
                        Prime Minister requested (a) US not respond to Jordanian request for arms
                        and (b) seek dissuade King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>
                        from following suicidal path.</p>
                    <p>Under Secretary said US aware Israel's concern about any arms accretion in
                        neighboring countries. We faced serious dilemma in Near East. Heart of
                        matter is whether better for Israel's security and peace of area for some
                        arms to be given to Jordan on controlled basis by friend of Israel or on
                        uncontrolled basis by Soviet Union. We remain interested in damping arms
                        spiral but face problem maintaining control over Jordan. We presumed Israel
                        regarded prospect of uncontrolled arming of Jordan by Soviets more ominous
                        than situation we contemplated. We agreed necessary make <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> understand stakes. Decision on
                        Jordan arms of utmost importance to US and Israel. We would take <pb n="307" xml:id="pg_307" facs="0339"/>careful account of Prime Minister's
                        message. US never understood we would consult Israel on Jordan arms decision
                        but would undertake inform Israel before action taken. Decision had been

                        might be taken within next few hours.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> said he was much
                        disturbed that action might be taken in a matter of hours since he had been
                        assured US officials would be in touch with him on this matter. He said he
                        felt considerable trepidation in taking his leave and appeared obviously
                        dejected. End <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>You should make following points to appropriate <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> officials. (1) Prime Minister's message ignores fundamental
                        problem facing us, i.e., question not whether Jordan gets arms but who
                        supplies them and in what quantity. (2) Message grossly overstates magnitude
                        threat to Israel of modernization Jordan Army. Entire projected sale
                        includes electronic gear and ground equipment including M48 tanks at rate 25
                        per year for four years beginning 1966. (3) We not meeting Jordan's full
                        request for arms and proposed offer may not suffice to relieve <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> pressure on King to build up his military
                        forces. (4) We look to <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> for suggestions
                        on how to ease growing tensions in area. We see no advantage in premature
                        reaction to plans such as Arab water diversion, extent of which unclear and
                        which far from fruition. Counter-pressure at this time only encourages and
                        speeds buildup we hope avoid. While we appreciate Israeli concern about
                        growing Arab military strength <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> should
                        remember US determination oppose aggression from whatever quarter. In last
                        analysis Western power is and will be prime deterrent to hostilities.<note n="5" xml:id="d137fn5">Telegram 702 to Tel Aviv, February 6, instructed

                    <p>Here is how the Jordan arms issue breaks down at this moment.</p>
                    <p>State/<gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> and our ambassadors all
                        still favor going ahead now with a minimum package (basic M–48 tanks, and
                        European jets) as essential to keep <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> from jumping the reservation. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> agree. In fact, most of them think even our minimum
                        package won't be enough to do more than buy us a little time. Only new
                        wrinkle is that if Hussein won't take M–48 tank we suggest we'll help him
                        get better German or <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> models.</p>
                    <p>The Israelis (and Mike Feldman) are still dug in hard. Their immediate
                        objective is to buy time to bargain with us, so they're taking a very stiff
                        line. I believe that if we had the time (and were willing to pay the price)
                        we could bring them around. But our dilemma is that if we stall any longer
                        we may lose <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>.</p>
                    <p>It's important to view the Jordan arms problem in full perspective, as part
                        of the major new Arab-Israeli crisis (this time over the Jordan waters)
                        which we face over the next year or two. We stand only to lose in this
                        crisis because we favor the status quo. So does Israel, which has a special
                        claim on us. So does Jordan, which joined Israel in sharing Palestine. The
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and Syria are revisionist powers, with the other Arabs
                        passively on their side on any issue involving Israel.</p>
                    <p>Thus our real aim is simply to get through this new crisis without: (1)
                        sacrificing Israel's security or getting a domestic black eye for appearing
                        to do so; (2) ruining our relations with the Arabs—along with all this would
                        cost us; (3) letting the Soviets score another major gain in the Near East,
                        as they did in 1954–57.</p>
                    <p>Israeli aims are rather different from our own. They've consistently felt
                        nervous about US support in a crunch, so have long favored tying us to them
                        publicly (security guarantees, arms aid), regardless of whether this would
                        throw the Arabs into Soviet hands or cost us our position in the Arab world.
                        We've always felt that such a course would be disastrous to Israel as well
                        as us. This is again a basic issue, as it is in every Arab-Israeli
                        crisis.</p>
                    <p>The second thing we want to avoid is another major Arab-Israeli clash,
                        because we'd probably have to step in to stop it. We'd be caught <pb n="309" xml:id="pg_309" facs="0341"/>in the middle again too. The best way to
                        avoid such a clash is to maintain an adequate deterrent balance. I'd now
                        argue that this will sooner or later require us to sell arms to Israel. The
                        simple reason is that otherwise the growing Soviet arms sales to the Arabs
                        will slowly tilt the balance against Israel (even after the latter gets
                        missiles, though not necessarily if it goes nuclear). But if we want to
                        prevent Israeli nuclear proliferation yet protect Israel and forestall
                        another conflict, we'll have to provide Israel with its own arms.</p>
                    <p>A sale of arms to Jordan could give us the excuse for selling to Israel too.
                        In fact, it would almost compel us to do so. We could justify this publicly
                        as a response to Soviet moves. Moreover, to the extent that our arms sales
                        to Jordan kept the Soviets and <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> out, this
                        would minimize the threat to Israel too.</p>
                    <p>Since this basic policy reversal on our part (from avoiding sales to making
                        them) is probably inevitable, there's a case for making it now! The Arabs
                        may react violently, but they will also react violently when we have to back
                        Israel in a Jordan waters crisis too. And Arab knowledge that they could not
                        win an arms race against Israel should contribute over the long run to a
                        damping down of the Arab-Israeli dispute.</p>
                    <p>In sum, I see longer range policy reasons for taking the plunge now.
                        Announcement of this new policy might largely blanket any Congressional
                        reactions to our sales to Jordan.</p>
                    <p>Returning to the immediate Jordan arms issue, we have three basic
                        alternatives:</p>
                    <p>A. Take Israeli line—offer nothing and rely on threats of withdrawal of US
                        aid. We've tried this already and <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> said he'd have to risk loss of US aid. Note his
                        reaction last August (Tab A).<note n="2" xml:id="d138fn2">Tab A is a copy of
                            telegram 84 from Amman, August 11; see <ref target="#d88fn2">footnote 2,
                                Document 88</ref>.</note> Experts think probabilities are that
                            <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> would have to go the
                        Soviet route. So this course gravely risks the worst of all
                            eventualities—Soviet/<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> arms in
                        Jordan.</p>
                    <p>B. Take State/<gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> line. Offer minimum package
                        designed to keep ball in play, while making crystal clear that if <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> goes Soviet route he'll sacrifice
                        US aid (<gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> and State think we might be able
                        to get <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> to go for <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, French, or German tanks and planes). Experts
                        still think this won't work unless package is rich enough. Also Israelis
                        have urged at highest level we not take this road; if we do so without
                        signing them on, we multiply our subsequent problems.</p>
                    <p>C. Stall for a little more time. State, <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>,
                        and our Ambassador all say we've stalled so long (nine months) that we must
                        fish or cut bait. <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> says so
                        too, and he's a gambler—capable of rash action. But there is a chance that
                        we could shake him enough, without closing the <pb n="310" xml:id="pg_310" facs="0342"/>door, to buy ourselves at least a few days and perhaps till
                        10 February, when he goes to Cairo. This would give a little time for us to
                        pressure and cajole the Israelis. My scenario is at Tab B.<note n="3" xml:id="d138fn3">Tab B, entitled “A Possible Stall for Time,” unsigned
                            and undated, is not printed.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>As to other possibilities, they seem to net out as follows:</p>
                    <p>1. Getting concerted Western pressure on <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> to lay off <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> is infeasible. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> would thumb his nose at us. Erhard is fighting
                        desperately to solve his own problem, i.e. forestalling Arab recognition of
                        East Germany. The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> favors a Jordan arms
                        deal.</p>
                    <p>2. The oil companies are no help. They see the problem, but are so under Arab
                        pressure now that they have no leverage with Arabs.</p>
                    <p>3. The Soviets won't help us out, because they stand to be the biggest
                        gainers from our woes. In fact, if we even broached the subject, they'd
                        squeal to the Arabs.</p>
                    <p>4. I personally favor an approach to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> if only to tell him what we plan to do. But not
                        before we get <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> signed on. Then
                        nothing will be lost from trying to convince <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> not to scream.</p>
                    <p>5. A secret high level mission to Israel is indicated immediately to try and
                        convince the Israelis we make sense. If it were authorized to offer arms
                        sales, it could succeed. <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName>
                        would be best, or <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> or myself
                        (but not Mike and I).</p>

                        taken account of the strongly adverse reaction from the Government of Israel
                        and the concern that would be aroused in many sectors of the Congress by a

                    <p>On the basis of this careful rethinking of the problem we are instructing you
                        to limit your offers to King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>
                        in accordance with this telegram and to try to buy time during which Western

                    <p>Before making any explicit offer to the King, you should forcefully make the
                        following points:</p>
                    <p>1. The United States friendship for, and support of, his regime in Jordan has
                        been amply and repeatedly demonstrated over the years. This is a partnership
                        we would like to continue. A partnership, however, requires mutual
                        understanding of each other's problems. We feel that we do understand the
                        difficulties of the situation <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>
                        is facing with respect to his arms buildup under the United Arab
                        Command.</p>
                    <p>2. Despite our serious misgivings about any large increases in armament in
                        the area we have authorized Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> to make as forthcoming an offer as feasible in the
                        circumstances. At the same time, the President wishes the King—as an
                        obligation under our mutual partnership—to understand United States'
                        concerns and inhibitions.</p>
                    <p>3. The ambitious arms buildup planned by the United Arab Command can lead
                        only to a rising spiral of military capability between Israel and the Arab
                        world. Sooner or later this will almost certainly result in an explosion
                        since the Israelis will not sit by and see the Arab world outdistance them.
                        Because of Jordan's geographic location, it will inevitably bear a
                        particularly heavy brunt from any Arab-Israeli holocaust.</p>
                    <p>4. The King's request has put us in serious dilemma. While we are attempting
                        to give the King as much support as possible, he must understand that a
                        major <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> contribution to the arms race in
                        Arab-Israel area will be bitterly resented by Congress and American people.
                        This would bring critical US domestic reaction that could adversely affect
                        our future ability to continue our cooperation with, and support of, <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>5. Our offer—which is as generous as is feasible—is necessarily contingent on
                            <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> not accepting any form of Soviet
                        military equipment. If <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> should elect to
                        turn to Soviet equipment, we would be regretfully compelled to terminate our
                        present military assistance program. More than that, we would necessarily
                        have to reexamine the status and continuance of our entire partnership
                        relation.</p>
                    <p>6. Finally, the King must keep in perspective the relative value to him of
                        close and continuing friendship and support of <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> as against a few tanks and airplanes. It is <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> earnest hope that <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> will not allow disappointment over
                        present arms negotiations to jeopardize partnership which we deeply value
                        and which we believe of critical importance to him.</p>

                    <p>Mac—</p>
                    <p>This is memo I sent <gloss target="#t_LBJ1">LBJ</gloss> yesterday,<note n="2" xml:id="d140fn2">Reference is apparently to <ref target="#d138">Document
                                138</ref>.</note> which I believe had major impact on tentative
                        decisions taken. Since he had <persName corresp="#p_MBD1">Moyers</persName>
                        sit in on meetings and <persName corresp="#p_MBD1">Bill</persName> called me
                        for lunch, I showed it to him and he asked me to tell <gloss target="#t_LBJ1">LBJ</gloss> he agreed.</p>
                    <p>In the series of meetings we held it became crystal clear that the
                        President's chief reason for not accepting the repeated State/<gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
                        recommendation was his concern over the US domestic reaction when it came
                        out that the US was supplying arms to a <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss>
                        aimed at Israel. Of course this was the angle we kept cluing him on, since
                            State/<gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> tended to argue only in terms
                        of keeping Jordan from going the Soviet route. The predictably violent
                        Israeli reaction (see <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>
                            letter)<note n="3" xml:id="d140fn3">See <ref target="#d137fn3">footnote
                                3, Document 137</ref>.</note> and <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName>'s flank attacks added to his worries.</p>
                    <p>It gradually dawned on me that we were three-quarters pregnant anyway. If
                            <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> accepted our package he'd
                        have to tell <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> in Cairo; once it then came
                        out that US selling to Jordan, we'd be trapped. In fact, Israelis themselves
                        threatened they might have to reveal it (according to Mike). Moreover, US
                        role in German tank deal is bound to leak soon; when this happened, we'd
                        stand revealed as making arms sales to Israel too. So I kept pressing on
                        State to face up to fact that if we agreed to sell Jordan, we'd have to sell
                        Israel too—as the only way of protecting our domestic flank. Moreover, as I
                        argued in attached, maintaining a decent Arab-Israeli deterrent balance was
                        essential to forestall another Arab-Israeli clash, one piling up of Soviet
                        arms to Arabs gave latter enough confidence.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MBD1">Moyers</persName> made a big contribution by
                        arguing Friday<note n="4" xml:id="d140fn4">February 5.</note> that we'd have
                        to make a public statement justifying arms to Jordan in a way that would
                        satisfy domestic critics. So at Saturday afternoon meeting<note n="5" xml:id="d140fn5">See <ref target="#d135fn2">footnote 2, Document
                                135</ref>.</note> I expanded on this. My argument was that the only
                        means of getting <pb n="314" xml:id="pg_314" facs="0346"/>away with arms to
                        Jordan was to say publicly we would help Israel too, in order to prevent
                        piling up of Soviet arms from threatening peace.</p>
                    <p>In addition to above arguments, I pointed out that we were inevitably being
                        pushed in this direction anyway, citing 1962 Hawk deal and then 1964 covert
                        tank deal. It was a fact of life that we were going to have to change our
                        policy. German attempt to renege on tank deal, coming at same time, might be
                        panicking the Israelis. But we needed their active support if we were to get
                        away with Jordan arms sale—only way to get this was to tell them we'd sell
                        to them too. So why not bite the bullet?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName> all
                        agreed in principle, though expressing reservations as to how much we should
                        say or do right off. I made clear that we'd get plenty of flak from the
                        Arabs, but perhaps best to ride it out now. Only alternative was a flat US
                        security guarantee and joint planning, which would spook the Arabs even
                        more. Jernegan agreed, saying a security guarantee would force us into arms
                        aid anyway, so was worse. There was no firm decision (I didn't press for one
                        because this is a major policy shift) but I do feel all top echelon are on
                        notice that if we sell to Jordan, we have no other viable alternative.</p>
                    <p>You should know that <gloss target="#t_LBJ1">LBJ</gloss> authorized modified
                        offer to Jordan (only basic M–48s, no US jets) only on basis unanimous
                        judgment <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> wouldn't accept.
                        Ergo, in effect it was a tactical device designed to buy a little time (I
                        was only one to say I thought some chance Hussein might buy).</p>
                    <p>Am going on at this length, because this whole affair may come to a boil
                        while I'm gone. I envisage a public statement (after news leaks) that US:
                        (1) reiterates 8 May '63 statement against aggression in <gloss target="#t_ME1">ME</gloss>; (2) has sought for years to avoid
                        contributing to <gloss target="#t_ME1">ME</gloss> arms race; (3) but in view
                        of constant Soviet effort to upset stability by cut-rate sales, US prepared
                        sell to friendly countries which don't wish to go Soviet route; (4) will
                        sell arms only for defensive purposes when obvious cases of imbalance
                        developing.</p>
                    <p>If we go this route, I believe we should send a credible emissary secretly to
                        Nasser pronto to clue him, saying that public spat will help no one and just
                        result in US/<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> split; we still prefer arms
                        control to arms race but he left us no choice (cluing him in advance on Hawk
                        deal helped immensely). Bob Anderson would be admirable (<gloss target="#t_LBJ1">LBJ</gloss> mentioned sending him to persuade <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> to lay off <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>, but <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> and I countered this wouldn't do any good just
                        now).</p>

                            King ranged over a variety of Near Eastern issues. No decisions were
                            reached in their discussion of the arms package. (National Archives and
                            Records Administration, <gloss target="#t_RG1">RG</gloss> 59, Central

                        and Bunte have spent morning on details of <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> proposal.</p>
                    <p>King listened intently my 45 minute presentation based on talking paper as
                        modified by Deptel 437.<note n="3" xml:id="d141fn3">Telegram 808 to Beirut
                                (<ref target="#d139">Document 139</ref>) was sent to Amman as
                            telegram 437.</note> He then expressed warm appreciation for amount and
                        seriousness of attention given Jordan's problems at highest levels <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>. He hoped I would report views he was about
                        to express so <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> leaders could further
                        consider his position. Otherwise “we may be in for some very grim times
                        indeed.” King repeated many points we have heard before, including statement
                        that whether Soviet equipment appears in Jordan now depends on our decisions
                        rather than on him. He expressed disappointment at ground package as we
                        presented it. Prompted by <persName corresp="#p_KGA2">Khammash</persName> he
                        said we appeared to be reopening understandings that he had thought long
                        since achieved on ground equipment sales. King and <persName corresp="#p_KGA2">Khammash</persName> both reacted visibly when told
                        M48A3's not available for sale. They did not, however, argue tank question
                        this evening. King later said this request had been intended to balance the
                        tanks being provided by Germany to Israel and converted to 105 mm guns. So
                        far as we could tell <persName corresp="#p_KGA2">Khammash</persName>'s main
                        difficulty with ground force proposal, apart from tanks, was five-year
                        delivery time. He appears still to want entire tranche within next year or
                        so.</p>
                    <p>On non-availability of US supersonic aircraft, King contented himself with
                        quiet assertion that if Western European aircraft could have done the job he
                        would not have troubled <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> with request for
                        American aircraft. <persName corresp="#p_KGA2">Khammash</persName> stated
                        that Mirage failed to meet requirements on both quality and price. King
                        observed gloomily that one at least of <pb n="316" xml:id="pg_316" facs="0348"/>great dangers he foresees ahead might have been avoided had
                        we been able to provide US aircraft. We inferred he was referring to costs I
                        had enumerated that would ensue if Jordanians took Soviet aircraft.</p>
                    <p>Other comments by King related to general situation in area, Jordan's exposed
                        position, efforts of Arabs to act responsibly rather than discordantly and
                        emotionally as so often in the past, need to build up Arab defensive forces
                        to stabilize Arab-Israel situation since “our friends” apparently unable
                        help bring solution and apprehension of great dangers likely in months
                        ahead.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: Session was clearly one in which both sides
                        laid out positions, with the Jordanian response being quite formal,
                        contained and in somewhat general terms. We may hear more of theme that
                        Israel getting better tanks than US willing to sell Jordan. At end of
                        session we were shown newspaper cartoon displaying large Uncle Sam holding
                        Germany who in turn holding an Israeli figure pointing a gun at a small
                        Arab. Further sessions on Monday may reveal other specifics of Jordan
                        position, and should give us chance to press detailed argumentation of our
                        position. I believe decision on Presidential letter should await this next
                        round.</p>

                    <p>This mission is felt to be necessary because of probability that Israelis

                    <p>President and Acting Secretary wish to do everything possible to forestall
                        anticipated Israeli drive in US against foreign aid and other essential US
                        policies. Such drive seems probable if <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
                        is not placated in face of Jordanian deal. Presumably a special emissary of
                        Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName>'s stature and
                        ability could help soothe Israeli feelings and bring about some cooling off
                        of high emotions.</p>
                    <p>We would appreciate your views regarding this projected mission.</p>
                    <p>Assuming arms deal with Jordan is in fact concluded, on terms you have
                        offered or on anything more liberal, we very much fear repercussions in
                        Congress affecting whole Middle East policies and perhaps other aspects
                        foreign policy. As indicated above, President himself deeply concerned about
                        this aspect. We are beginning to think that only step we could take which
                        has chance of being really effective is to give Israel assurance that when
                        and if necessary <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> would be willing to
                        consider direct arms sales on favorable terms. Following is some language
                        illustrating what we have in mind:</p>
                    <p>“1. Recognizing that continued Soviet arms sales to the Arabs can over time
                        upset the deterrent balance (which US arms sales to Jordan are designed in
                        fact to preserve), the US would consider selective sales of arms to
                        compensate for any disproportionate buildup on the Arab side.</p>
                    <pb n="318" xml:id="pg_318" facs="0350"/>
                    <p>“2. This, however, does not seem to us to be an immediate problem. We
                        continue to prefer that Israel seek maximum help from European sources. But,
                        if and when we agree that Israel has a demonstrable need which cannot be
                        satisfactorily filled elsewhere, the US will consider direct sales on
                        favorable credit terms.</p>
                    <p>“3. In return to <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> desires Israeli
                        undertakings: a) actively to support US aid to Jordan and other Arabs and to
                        assist in abating the stir over aid to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>; b) not to undertake premature preemptive action against
                        Arab diversion works; c) not to go nuclear or deploy strategic missiles; d)
                        accept full <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards.”</p>
                    <p>Would like to know how this strikes you and <persName>Barnes</persName>.
                        Realize Israelis may well balk at agreeing to 4 considerations in para. 3
                        above. However, if we got even three of them, with or without commitment to
                        abandon missiles, we would have achieved some pretty major objectives,
                        possibly at the cost of nothing more than we will inevitably be forced to
                        give over coming years without any quid pro quos.</p>
                    <p>Do you and <persName>Barnes</persName> think there is any chance of getting
                            <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> to postpone his trip to
                        Cairo for a week or two? This might give us more time for consideration here
                        and further attempts to bring him around, while at same time it would give
                        us breathing space in which to persuade Israelis to calm down.</p>
                    <p>Do you think that a concession of 100 M–48A3s to be delivered in three years
                        or thereabouts would enable you make deal with <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>?</p>

                        since <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> claims he's committed
                        to take <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>s otherwise. If not, he suggests
                        we say we'll reconsider and answer a week from now. He also suggests we tell
                        King we'll help him try to get European jets, but if this fails we'll
                        provide 104s. I'd prefer saying we'd “consider” 104s in that case.</p>
                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Tanks</hi>. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName>
                        says we're in a bind because Jordan knows Israel is getting better tanks. He
                        proposes offering M48A1 with promise to “discuss” conversion to M48A3 “at
                        early date” (it would take two years to deliver in any case).</p>
                    <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Timing of Deliveries</hi>. King claims they must meet
                            <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> timetable, so must have whole ground
                        force package in one year instead of four (1966–69) we propose. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> urges two years with added stretchout
                        on tanks. I'd prefer three years because early deliveries might spook
                        Israelis into pre-empting.</p>
                    <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Credit terms</hi>. Jordan wants full credit terms (we
                        offered only $7 million revolving credit) so it can get whole package before
                        other Arabs pay for it. King claims Soviets offer easy credit terms.
                            <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> and State favor increasing
                        credit margin to $15 million and letting first year's sales go on credit.
                        I'd be much tougher, since our safety valve is to sell only what King can
                        find money for.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> will argue for sweetening
                        package as <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> wants to keep
                            <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> on the hook while we take
                        7–10 days to reconsider. But the higher we bid the more trouble we'll have
                        with Israelis (who now know our minimum). So I'd argue for just enough
                        sweetening to show <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> we're
                        serious and 10 days reconsideration in Washington (while we beat up
                        Israelis).</p>
                    <p>B. <hi rend="italic">How do we calm down Israelis?</hi> Despite their leak,
                        they're still salvageable in my judgment. My hunch is they panicked because
                        Germans reneged on them at very same time. So after a great show of
                        indignation, we ought to go back at them hard, since we need their active
                        help to protect your domestic flank.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">As I see it, more turns on what we're prepared to offer
                            them than on who carries the word</hi>. To really calm them we'll have
                        to say (once other arguments are exhausted), that we'll sell to them too if
                        and when we both agree that a need arises. This is a mighty big sweetener,
                        and a <pb n="320" xml:id="pg_320" facs="0352"/>mighty risky one, since it
                        may get us in real dutch with the Arabs. We may even make it impossible for
                            <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> to take our arms. State
                        is for this in principle, but afraid to bite the bullet.</p>
                    <p>If we do go this route, we ought also to get some quid pro quos: (a) nuclear
                        non-proliferation and acceptance of <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>
                        controls; (b) active Israeli lobbying in support of Jordan arms deal and aid
                        to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>; (c) a commitment against
                        pre-emption on Jordan waters.</p>
                    <p>C. <hi rend="italic">How do we negotiate this?</hi> A special emissary is the
                        best bet, and the sooner the better before the whole business leaks. But the
                        more public the exercise the more risks of leaks. <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> has the clout (and I'll gladly
                        side him) but: (a) Israeli papers will have a field day speculating why
                            <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> is there; (b) Arabs may
                        put two and two together and say he's there to get Israeli permission to
                        sell arms to Jordan.</p>
                    <p>D. <hi rend="italic">If we decide to sell to Israel, we must clue <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> in advance</hi>. This may be a
                        long shot, but it damped his reaction to Hawk deal. We'd have to tell
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> face-to-face that if Arabs
                        keep building up against Israel, we'll have to maintain the balance.

                            had been conditioned on secrecy but had become public knowledge, and had
                            proposed to Israel that it stop further shipments and pay Israel a sum

                        immediately be after us to replace this. Therefore, I see every merit in
                        urging Germans at highest level not to cancel but to promise Arabs they'll
                        end program as soon as existing commitments are filled. They could claim
                        this is a matter of honor.</p>
                    <p>The above combination of moves seems the best way out of our painful dilemma,

                    <p>1. This meeting, scheduled for 4:30 on Tuesday, 9 February, convened in the
                        Cabinet Room at 6:00 P.M. It adjourned at 6:30. The President was absent
                        from the Room for about ten minutes, the Vice President came to the meeting
                        ten minutes late.</p>
                    <p>2. Acting Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> opened the
                        discussion with a detailed description of the recommendations made by
                        Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> in a cable
                        from Amman (EmbTel-444).<note n="2" xml:id="d144fn2">See <ref target="#d143fn2">footnote 2, Document 143</ref>.</note> He also
                        outlined a recommendation for a compensating deal with the Israelis. There
                        was general agreement on his recommendation except for Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> who expressed his opposition on the
                        grounds that the Israelis would not accept the United States “package.” It
                        was clear that neither the President nor the Vice President liked Acting
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>'s proposal either, but
                        their opposition appeared to stem from troubles which they anticipated
                        having with the Congress.</p>
                    <p>3. The meeting ended inconclusively. The President did authorize the sending
                        of an emissary to Tel Aviv. (It was later decided that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName> would be the President's

                            after Jordan obtained Soviet equipment, and he urged that he be given

                        least two years according Defense.) You should leave King under no illusion
                        that we can promise that expedited delivery will mean delivery within one or

                        discuss A3's later. If King still insists on either point, you should say
                        you will return Washington and arrange further consideration, although you
                        cannot promise what outcome will be.</p>
                    <p>This does not mean that acceptable deal for King ultimately foreclosed but
                        growing feeling here is that final agreement with Jordanians on any package
                        will be extremely difficult sell in U.S. as well as in Israel if full
                        discussions have not been held previously with Israelis. Plans not yet

                    <p>Your mission is to explain to the Government of Israel in full and friendly
                        candor the reasons why we believe that limited and carefully spaced out US
                        arms sales to Jordan are far better than the alternative of uncontrollable
                        Soviet or <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> supply.</p>
                    <p>Since the Israelis seem to have focussed only on the added threat to them
                        from US arms sales to Jordan, you should lay heavy emphasis on the far
                        greater threat which would ensue from uncontrolled Soviet or <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> supply. You should point out that from our
                        talks with King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> we are
                        convinced that, unless he can get minimum satisfaction from us or Western
                        European sources, he will be compelled to take the Soviet route.</p>
                    <p>I want you to make clear that our effort from the outset has been primarily
                        aimed at minimizing the threat to Israeli security and area stability, not
                        the reverse. Indeed, we have no independent interest in Jordan. Our
                        subsidies to it, now totalling almost a half billion dollars, have been
                        primarily designed to maintain an independent Arab kingdom, not under
                        hostile domination, along Israel's longest and most vulnerable frontier. In
                        our judgment this factor has contributed materially to Israel's
                        security.</p>
                    <p>You should further stress our conviction, buttressed by the views of our
                        Joint Chiefs of Staff, that the limited arms sales we envisage to Jordan
                        will not significantly increase the overall threat to Israel. Even <pb n="324" xml:id="pg_324" facs="0356"/>if this were the case, however, the
                        increased threat would hardly be comparable to that created by Jordan's
                        acceptance of Soviet and <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> arms, and
                        possibly <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> troops on Jordan's soil, which
                        in turn would risk ultimate <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> domination
                        of Jordan. Thus I see US arms sales to Jordan as merely a further step in a
                        longstanding US policy, which I understand to be tacitly acquiesced in by
                        Israel, of forestalling this worst of all eventualities.</p>
                    <p>If you are asked whether the US has already agreed on arms sales with King
                            <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> you should say that we
                        have not yet done so, but are prepared to do so shortly if he meets our
                        terms. I believe that these terms are so much in Israel's interest that I
                        wish to solicit not only Israel's understanding but its active support of
                        our policy.</p>
                    <p>While you are not authorized to discuss the matter pending further
                        instructions, I am aware that to secure Israel's active support it will
                        probably be necessary to indicate our willingness to sell arms to Israel
                        sooner or later. The US recognizes that continued Soviet arms sales to the
                        Arabs can over time upset the Arab-Israeli deterrent balance. The Israelis
                        will be particularly eager for such sales if West Germany cancels the
                        remainder of its program.</p>
                    <p>We continue to prefer that Israel seek maximum help from European sources.
                        However, if and when we and Israel jointly agree that Israel has a
                        demonstrable need which cannot be satisfactorily filled elsewhere, we will
                        consider direct sales on favorable credit terms. In return the US would
                        expect to receive certain undertakings from Israel. These matters will be
                        the subject of a further instruction to you.</p>

                        uninterrupted series of meetings, including two with Prime Minister and long
                        session with Foreign Minister, <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName>,
                            <persName corresp="#p_PS9">Peres</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_RY1">Rabin</persName>, etc. I made and remade all points
                        in my brief, particularly stressing lack of any viable alternatives. <pb n="325" xml:id="pg_325" facs="0357"/>Will not repeat these here since
                        detailed report will follow. Highlights are:</p>
                    <p>1. Israelis, while immediately and deeply concerned over prospect US arms
                        sales to Jordan, see it in larger context of unexpected cohesiveness of
                            <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss>, Bonn's caving to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, US catering to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, and continued Soviet arms aid to the
                        Arabs. In effect they see this combination of circumstances as creating (a)
                        an increasingly grave threat to Israeli security; (b) a psychological fillip
                        to the Arabs, which enhances their belief that Carthage can be destroyed;
                        and (c) an incipient crisis of confidence among the Israeli public. By now
                        they are far more exercised about <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> (and his victory over Bonn) than over Jordan.</p>
                    <p>2. While Israelis have calmed down considerably on Jordan arms issue, little
                        doubt that Israeli military in particular acutely disturbed by prospect of
                        even a modest increase in strength of one of the two adjacent countries they
                        have not regarded as a military threat. From briefing by Rabin with no
                        punches pulled it clear Israelis were counting on not having to divert much
                        first-line strength to screen piddling Jordanian forces. While they still
                        talk about Jordan acquiring an offensive instead of defensive capability,
                        long and short of matter is that they now feel they'll have to deploy a fair
                        proportion of their standing forces against a surprise Jordanian attack,
                        instead of keeping them mostly in south against <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and secondarily in north opposite Syrians. They made much
                        of lack of warning time.</p>
                    <p>3. Beyond security threat is political problem faced by <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> as a practical politician heading
                        unstable coalition and a split, plurality Mapai Party, going into a fall
                        election, and with Ben-Gurion having in effect declared open war against
                        him. While he himself didn't stress this point, and is probably more
                        convinced than he's willing to concede as yet by our arguments, it is
                        obvious that he is deeply concerned over how to explain to his Cabinet, and
                        the public why it's the least of all evils for Israel's great friend the US
                        to sell arms to the <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>4. With all due allowances for the replay of old records, it is quite
                        apparent that the Israelis foresee a gathering storm over the Jordan waters
                        issue, and as might be expected, are nervous over US support.</p>
                    <p>5. Also significant were repeated veiled and not veiled references to the
                        need for pre-emption. Most of these were in connection with the need to
                        scare off the Arabs from their counter-diversion scheme. While much of this
                        talk was for our benefit, there seems little doubt that a pre-emptive
                        psychology is building up in Israel and will become an increasing risk so
                        long as the Israelis see no other way out of their dilemma.</p>
                    <p>6. Throughout eight hours of almost uninterrupted back and forth, we kept
                        bringing them back to the fundamental dilemma—that however unpalatable the
                        course we proposed to take, it seemed much less <pb n="326" xml:id="pg_326" facs="0358"/>risky than the most likely alternative. Though <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> and others asked why we didn't
                        threaten to cut off our subsidies, etc., I believe that such plaints were
                        for form's sake and that they recognize that we are proposing the lesser of
                        evils.</p>
                    <p>7. If nothing else, this exercise has been most useful in re-establishing
                        intimate communication with <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>, which had
                        felt genuinely bruised by our failure to give sufficient advance
                        notification. Quite clearly, Bonn's craven behavior had added to the shock.
                        There were many harsh words about the Germans today.</p>
                    <p>8. More important, we believe we have gotten the top level of <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> (though not yet their military) over the
                        hurdle of reacting primarily to Jordan arms and not to the larger issue.
                        Pending instructions, I sedulously (and I must say disingenuously) refrained
                        from even hinting at compensatory US measures. I did, however, seek to focus
                        their attention on constructive responses by repeatedly posing the question
                        of whether they had any better solution than the one we had come up
                        with.</p>
                    <p>9. They didn't do more than hint at this, but this was enough to make
                            <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Barbour</persName> and me conclude that
                            <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName>, and
                        probably Peres are already beginning to turn their minds to what Israel
                        could do itself and get from the US to cope with their problems. For
                        example, <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName> both noted that we had not made any
                        recent public statement of our support for Israel's use of Jordan waters
                        within Unified Plan. <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> mentioned
                        the importance of dispelling any illusions the Arabs might have as to our
                        continued determination to prevent Arab aggression against Israel. As Golda
                        Meir put it, we should tell <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> we
                        would give Israel a tank for every tank Moscow gave him. All concerned
                        carefully pointed out that any increase in Jordanian capabilities, plus
                        Israel's loss of further German arms, created an even greater increasing
                        requirement for added Israeli deterrent strength. In the afternoon Rabin
                        quite pointedly mentioned that Israel's primary needs were tanks and
                        planes.</p>
                    <p>10. We have another meeting scheduled for 5 P.M. Sunday local time. Taking
                        advantage of the Sabbath, we suggested postponement till then to give
                        Washington time to consider (in the midst of Vietnam) my report. Since we
                        have tried our hardest to force the Israelis themselves to come up with
                        alternatives, we may receive proposals at that time. However, Peres has
                        asked to see me urgently tomorrow morning, which may provide some advance
                        clues.</p>
                    <p>11. The recommendations of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Barbour</persName> and myself are already before you. But developments
                        today reinforce our conviction that Israel can be brought to accept, and
                        even to support quietly, limited arms aid to Jordan if we are prepared to do
                        and say those things which would reinforce the deterrent balance and,
                        equally important, give verbal evidence of this intention to both the Arab
                        and Israeli audiences.</p>
                    <pb n="327" xml:id="pg_327" facs="0359"/>
                    <p>12. I feel duty bound to add that, so long as we do not close with <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> and confront Israel with yet
                        another presumed fait accompli it does not seem imperative to make either a
                        general or specific tender to the GOI right now. However, the sooner we can
                        do so, at least in general terms, the more rapidly we will be able to move
                        on to the question of how to get demonstrable Israeli support of our Jordan
                        arms program. Suffice it to say that if we do feel compelled to make

                            suggested a private understanding with King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> that Jordan would not increase its armored
                            strength on the West Bank or would do so only to a very small degree,
                            and he requested that the United States make up the shortfall of 90

                        understanding, even if one could be arrived at, would be limited.</p>

                        also inform him that Jordan intends remove from its inventory around 100

                        tanks in months ahead. Schroeder's reported demarche to <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> Ambassador Bonn could indicate Germany may

                    </list>
                    <p>I have been in Jordan February 7–10 negotiating with King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> on the arms problem.
                        Simultaneously, several meetings with the President were held here as
                        developments unfolded.</p>
                    <p>In the initial presentation to King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>, I was authorized to offer: (1) The basic M–48
                        tanks, (2) A $42 million ground equipment package to be delivered over a
                        five-year period and to include the tanks, (3) U.S. acquiescence in
                        Jordanian acquisition of a West European supersonic fighter squadron, and
                        (4) a $7 million revolving credit. This was not enough to satisfy King
                            <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>.</p>
                    <pb n="329" xml:id="pg_329" facs="0361"/>
                    <p>The King revealed his knowledge of the supposedly secret tank deal between
                        the Federal Republic of Germany and Israel which, as the King pointed out,
                        included the 105 mm gun. He argued that it was not fair to offer Jordan a
                        tank inferior to that which Israel is getting. The King was also
                        dissatisfied with the delivery schedules envisaged in our offer, the amount
                        of credit, and the West European supersonic. He and the Jordanian side
                        argued that the over-all American offer was not sufficient to enable Jordan
                        to withstand Unified Arab Command pressures to accept Soviet equipment.</p>
                    <p>After the second long meeting on February 8, I reported that the real issue
                        had become whether to sell arms to both Jordan and Israel or to Israel
                        alone, following Jordanian acquisition of Soviet materiel. I recommended
                        increasing the credit to $15 million, offering the M–48A1 tank with a
                        fall-back to the M–48A3 (with diesel engine), cooperating with Jordan to
                        find a suitable Free World supersonic fighter (with American supersonics to
                        be held eventually in the offing if a suitable non-American plane could not
                        be found) and speeding up of deliveries to the extent feasible.</p>
                    <p>After a February 9 White House meeting, the Department authorized me to offer
                        (1) $15 million credit, (2) the basic M–48 tank for the first part of the
                        Jordanian order with an agreement to reconsider the possibility of getting
                        the M–48A3 for the second part, but (3) to offer nothing further on
                        supersonics beyond our original offer.</p>
                    <p>In a final meeting February 10 the King held firm to his request for the
                        M–48A3, but did not insist on delivery before late 1967–1968. He did,
                        however, ask for an agreement to supply 100 of the M–48's in calendar years
                        1965–1966. Brigadier <persName corresp="#p_KGA2">Khammash</persName> later
                        specified 50 M–48 tanks in 1965 and 50 in 1966. The King is obviously
                        convinced he cannot successfully resist the pressures of the <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> with anything less than the above
                        assurances. I am persuaded he has soberly estimated his position and is
                        staking his chances for continued close relations with the West on our
                        supplying what he judges will be necessary to hold his membership in the
                        Arab Club. Our offer to help Jordan find an acceptable aircraft from Free
                        World sources remains. We are proposing to the President that he concur in
                        our proposals to supply 100 M–48 tanks in 1965–66 and 100 M–48A3 tanks with
                        the 105 mm gun in late 1967–68.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Robert Komer</persName> has gone to
                        Israel as a special emissary of the President in order to convey our
                        rationale for providing arms to Jordan and to reassure Israeli leaders of
                        our continuing deep interest in Israel's security and welfare.</p>
                    <p>We anticipate agreement to sell arms to Jordan and cancellation of German
                        military assistance to Israel will create pressure for direct sale of U.S.
                        arms to Israel. To mitigate the severe political damage this <pb n="330" xml:id="pg_330" facs="0362"/>would cause the U.S. in the Arab world,
                            <gloss target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss> has recommended that we compensate
                        for any disproportionate Arab military buildup only in return for Israeli
                        agreement 1) to support actively U.S. aid to Jordan and to assist in
                        abetting the stir over aid to the U.A.R., 2) to forego nuclear weapons and
                        accept full <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards, 3) not to
                        deploy offensive missiles, and 4) not to undertake premature preemptive
                        action against Arab diversion works.</p>

                    <p>975. From <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName>. Third session with
                            <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> went as expected. <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_PS9">Peres</persName> again
                        present. Prime Minister did not labor Jordan arms problem, but made strong
                        plea that this plus German capitulation to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> confronted Israel with a critical dilemma. Who would
                        replace the German tanks, much less provide the added tanks needed to meet
                        those the US proposed to provide Hussein? The only way out of this dilemma
                        would be direct US supply of arms. He, <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName> made
                        much of the argument that the Israeli public would never understand why we
                        could sell to <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> member for an openly
                        anti-Israeli scheme, yet not sell to our Israeli friends.</p>
                    <p>In effect, <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>'s pitch is that the
                        only way in which Israel can justify acquiescing in US arms sales to Jordan
                        is if we do the same for Israel too. I will hold until my return the
                        remainder of his arguments, but there is no doubt that Israelis are building
                        up quite a head of steam.</p>
                    <p>To fend off further repetitious argument, I responded that I felt I now had a
                        full understanding of their concerns and had succeeded in turn in clarifying
                        our concerns to them. Therefore, best thing would <pb n="331" xml:id="pg_331" facs="0363"/>be for me to return as soon as possible to
                        Washington and lay their views before the President.<note n="2" xml:id="d150fn2">

                            unless otherwise instructed. (Ibid., DEF 12–5 JORDAN) Upon receiving

                    <p>I felt compelled to say that I was confident we would not make any final
                        decisions on aid to Jordan without fully considering both Israel's worries
                        and its requests. However, I warned them that the Jordan matter might have a
                        very short fuse.</p>
                    <p>Despite my disclaimers, the Israelis obviously expected that the President
                        would not send out an emissary on such a mission without certain
                        compensatory gestures toward them. To help fill the gap, I told them I had
                        received new Presidential message asking me to assure them that the US
                        remained fully committed to the security and well-being of Israel, would
                        take their concerns (as reported by me) most carefully into account, and
                        could be depended on to stand by Israel in difficult times ahead. In turn he
                        hoped they would appreciate our motives in such matters as Jordan arms deal,
                        where we had Israel's own security interests very much in mind.<note n="3" xml:id="d150fn3">No such message has been found. Telegram 750 to Tel

                    <p>Once this painful episode was over, I raised (to ease the tension) the Cubic
                        matter, <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> missiles, and Jordan waters. My
                        debunking of the first two was quite reassuring to <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> while the last provided a useful
                        opportunity to counsel restraint. We can expect plenty of trouble on this
                        issue, too, however.</p>
                    <p>In sum, <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Barbour</persName> and I believe that my
                        mission was highly opportune in giving Israelis a much needed chance to blow
                        off steam and then be brought tactfully back to earth. We have bought a
                        little time and hopefully forestalled further such mishaps as the leak here
                        on Jordan arms. But everything I've heard here tends to fortify my
                        conviction that to sell arms to Jordan without at least doing the same for
                        Israel will generate a major crisis in our relations. Moreover, their acute
                        worry over the general deterioration of their security position (of which
                            <pb n="332" xml:id="pg_332" facs="0364"/>Jordan arms is only a part) is
                        gradually generating a pre-emptive psychology. It could even lead at some
                        point to a decision to go nuclear if this appeared to be the only way to
                        maintain a deterrent edge.</p>

                        no open sesame to new PL–480 agreements. Increments under existing agreement
                        are out of question in any event and negotiations for new agreement would be
                        unacceptable to Congress and US public as US–<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> relations now stand. Trust Embassy will lose no opportunity
                        to impress these realities on <gloss target="#t_UARG1">UARG</gloss> with
                        specific reference to following points:</p>
                    <p>1. As state with important interests in Near East and major responsibility
                        for defense of free world, US determined bring its power to bear for
                        stability and progress that area: a) by opposing aggression; b) by
                        cooperating in area development.</p>
                    <p>2. This policy is area-wide. <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> is party to
                        no intra-area disputes, seeks with every like-minded state friendly
                        bilateral relationship tailored to specific needs, whether for trade, aid,
                        military backing, or PL–480.</p>
                    <p>3. Title 1 program in Egypt is not designed to buy off <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. We recognize sovereign right to differ.
                        However, growing body of American opinion feels <gloss target="#t_UARG1">UARG</gloss> has gone beyond protection its own interests into area of
                        unwarranted pressure on US interests in Near East and Africa. Only major
                        Administration effort turned back Congressional initiative to terminate
                        PL–480 sales to <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>.</p>
                    <pb n="333" xml:id="pg_333" facs="0365"/>
                    <p>4. In defending his need for flexibility in conduct of foreign policy,
                        President also gave recognition to need for improvement in psychological
                        climate of US–<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> relationship if economic
                        cooperation is to resume. He is counting on <gloss target="#t_UARG1">UARG</gloss> to meet its share of responsibility by according more
                        attention to US interests in the several issues that divide us.</p>
                    <p>5. Administration could not justify to Congress or public continuation of aid
                        to states supplying bloc arms to Congo insurgents. Since US and <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> both support Congolese unity and
                        independence, they should be able to dispose very quickly of this obstacle
                        to their cooperation by working for constructive cooperation between <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> and GDRC for a realistic solution.</p>
                    <p>6. Continuing drain on Egyptian resources to support expeditionary force in
                        Yemen also makes US aid to Egypt hard to justify. While <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> is not party to Yemen negotiations, it will
                        continue support earliest possible reduction of Egyptian presence for common
                        good of US and <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>7. Washington regrets hostile statements from Arab capitals about Israel, is
                        somewhat heartened by indications of <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                        success in channeling Arab hostility into defensive rather than offensive
                        posture. <gloss target="#t_UARG1">UARG</gloss> has intimated best hope of
                        peaceful Arab-Israel accommodation lies in consolidation of US–<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> relations. Equally true that Arab-Israel
                        hostilities could destroy all that US–<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                        cooperation has achieved or could be expected to achieve in this decade.</p>
                    <p>8. Also germane to above discussion is Deptel 4760.<note n="3" xml:id="d151fn3">Telegram 4760 to Cairo, February 11, stated that before

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Mission to Israel</hi>. As your emissary, I explained why
                        we would probably have to sell certain arms to Jordan and asked for Israeli
                        understanding—it being as much in Israel's interest as our own. I did not
                        allude to what we might offer Israel as an offset, but the Israelis very
                        quickly raised this issue with me. It is clearly the core of the
                        problem.</p>
                    <p>In three very cordial meetings with <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> and his key people I believe I got across why arms
                        sales to Jordan were the least bad of the highly unpalatable choices with
                        which we were both confronted. By probing for their ideas as to any other
                        way out, I satisfied myself that they too see no better solution, much as
                        they dislike ours. They trust <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>'s motives less than we, and regard us as probably not
                        having exerted enough pressure.</p>
                    <p>Moreover, two specific aspects of our Jordan arms position greatly bother
                        Israel. First is the geographic fact that the bulge of Arab Palestine on the
                        West Bank of the Jordan almost cuts Israel in two. While <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> up to this point has garrisoned it
                        only thinly, Israelis fear that the <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> (and
                        his own added confidence) might lead him to put substantial forces on the
                        West Bank. This would require Israel to redeploy a substantial part of the
                        forces it now has in the north and south against the main Arab threats.
                        Second, <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> asks how he (especially
                        as a politician running for re-election in November) can explain that he
                        agrees the US should arm an Arab member of a new unified command aimed at
                        Israel—and at a time when Germany has just reneged on arms.</p>
                    <p>So the Israeli position is that they simply cannot go along with US arms
                        sales to Jordan, much less quietly support them, unless certain other
                        measures are taken to enhance their security position—which they regard as
                        sharply deteriorating in recent months. To understand their violent initial
                        reaction (though they've calmed down some now), one must see it in this
                        larger context. Our proposed sale (which they took as a fait accompli) came
                        as an added shock right on the heels of Bonn's cancellation of arms aid.
                        This had a double adverse psychological impact because it not only meant the
                        loss of one of their three major sources of arms supply (France and the
                            <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> are left) but was a clear victory for
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>. Then, just as they were
                        losing a source of tanks, we told them we planned to provide some to their
                        enemies.</p>
                    <pb n="335" xml:id="pg_335" facs="0367"/>
                    <p>These two shocks also occurred at a time of rising Israeli concern over the
                        unexpected vitality being shown by the Arab counter-diversion scheme and by
                        the Unified Arab Command (they made a great point of taking me right up to
                        the border to see the Syrians digging canals in plain sight). Israel clearly
                        anticipates a developing crisis over the Jordan Waters (and is worrying over
                        where we stand). Finally, the embattled Israelis regarded our Hill fight to
                        continue aid to Nasser as a capitulation after he thumbed his nose at us,
                        burned our library and shot down our plane. All the above will give you the
                        current frustrated mood in Israel. With all due allowance for Israeli
                        emotionalism and shrewd bargaining tactics, it is a reality with which we
                        must deal.</p>
                    <p>Indeed, <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> and the others kept
                        coming back to the larger argument that continued Soviet arms aid to the
                        Arabs, combined now with a surprisingly coordinated Arab approach, was
                        creating a new order of threat to Israel. This, together with the partial
                        drying up of Israel's European arms sources, made the US policy of avoiding
                        direct arms supply out of date. If the US was as firmly committed to
                        Israel's security as we kept saying, and if our policy was to maintain a
                        deterrent balance to forestall another Arab-Israeli war, we must become
                        direct arms suppliers to Israel. Only this way could we deprive <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> of his psychological victory over
                        Bonn in the short run, and convince the Arabs that they could not overpower
                        Israel in the long run.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> also made a strong plea for
                        early public US support on the Jordan Water issue, as a means both of
                        reassuring the Israeli electorate and deterring the Arabs from continuing
                        their diversion scheme. He gave me a letter (Tab A),<note n="2" xml:id="d152fn2">
                            <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>'s letter to <hi rend="italic">Johnson</hi>, dated February 14, is attached but not
                            printed.</note> asking you to receive his Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Golda Meir</persName> in early March to put this case
                        personally to you after we'd had time to digest my report.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Conclusions</hi>. Israel's worries over its deteriorating
                        security position, and its resultant mood of frustration are likely to grow,
                        since the prospect is one of rising Arab Israeli tension over the Jordan
                        Waters issue.</p>
                    <p>1. Therefore, unless the Arab diversion scheme loses momentum or the German
                        action is reversed, there will be increasing Israeli pressure on us for
                        help, regardless of what we do about Jordan arms.</p>
                    <p>2. While Israel now more fully understands the rationale for US arms for
                        Jordan, and <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> at least probably see it as the least
                        bad way out of a painful dilemma, Israel will be compelled to oppose such
                        sales in the absence of compensatory actions tending to reduce their adverse
                        impact. <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> put me on notice that
                        he would be compelled to denounce them, especially in an election year.</p>
                    <pb n="336" xml:id="pg_336" facs="0368"/>
                    <p>3. Moreover, such US action would (a) dangerously increase already noticeable
                        pre-emptive tendencies, aimed at warning off the Arabs from their
                        counter-diversion schemes by overt action; and (b) increase Israel's
                        tendency to go nuclear, as the best means of offsetting the decline in its
                        conventional deterrent posture.</p>
                    <p>4. Because Israel's leaders recognize that controlled US arms sales to Jordan
                        are probably necessary, however, they would prefer to find some way of
                        justifying them by being able to point to other US actions favoring Israel.
                        Their first requirement is US acceptance of principle of direct arms supply.
                        Second, they want US agreement to supply the 90 tanks Bonn cancelled. Third,
                        they want some arrangement which would insure that <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> keeps his new armor on the East
                        Bank. Fourth, they want public US support of Israel's position on the Jordan
                        Waters and a reiteration of our pledges to resist aggression.</p>
                    <p>5. The Israelis were somewhat reassured that we intend carefully to control
                        and space out any Jordan arms sales, especially that we contemplate selling
                        only 100 M–48 tanks. To the extent that we enrich the Jordan arms package we
                        will have to enrich what we do for them.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Recommendations</hi>. I believe that we can get at least
                        quiet Israeli support of US arms sales if we do at least the following:</p>
                    <p>1. Keep the Jordan arms package at the present level, i.e. no M–48A3 tanks
                        and no US aircraft. If we have to tell <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> we'll consider these later, let's face up to this
                        problem when we come to it.</p>
                    <p>2. Tell the Israelis privately that we will consider direct arms sales if,
                        as, and when we jointly agree they're required, if they in turn will give
                        certain undertakings to us.</p>
                    <p>3. Be prepared to sell 90 M–48A1 tanks, and to say so publicly, if the
                        Germans finally cancel.</p>
                    <p>4. Agree in principle to appropriate public statements on Jordan Waters
                        diversion and our opposition to aggression, if we can reach a meeting of
                        minds on Israeli restraint and get them not to insist on the letter of the
                        Johnston Plan.</p>
                    <p>In sum, we can make a deal with the Israelis by doing certain things that we
                        would probably have to do sooner or later anyway if Arab-Israeli tensions
                        heat up.</p>

                    <p>The Secretary reviewed the proposed memorandum to the President on Near East
                            arms<note n="2" xml:id="d153fn2">Evidently a draft of <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>'s February 19 memorandum, <ref target="#d155">Document 155</ref>.</note> and made the following
                        comments:</p>
                    <p>In the first paragraph, “compensatory assistance for Israel” should be
                        “balanced assistance”. The former, he thought, implied we were “paying off”
                        Israel. Our concern, in fact, is with Israel's security.</p>
                    <p>He thought that we should not agree at this juncture to tell Jordan we would
                        sell U.S. supersonic aircraft if their needs would not be met from other
                        free world sources. He suggested we should do no more than agree to consider
                        the sale. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> replied he felt
                        we would have to go beyond this. Since the Jordanis were in the process of
                        checking with the French on the Mirage, we might be faced with the problem
                        within two weeks.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that we should not go beyond considering sympathetically
                        the sale of aircraft. He noted that prior to 1967 we might for a variety of
                        reasons have to cancel the sales agreement.</p>
                    <p>Paragraph 2b, the Secretary thought, implied that we would condone an Israeli
                        attack provided it had exhausted action in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. He said that we must never indicate that we would endorse a
                        preemptive attack that would be support for an aggression. He suggested that
                        we inform the Israelis that the diversion problem should be taken to the
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> where the U.S. would be prepared to
                        lend support on the basis of the principles of the Johnston Plan.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> hoped the U.S. could stick
                        with this position. The Israelis already seemed to be preparing a case on
                        the internal and external threat to Israel, and comparing their position to
                        that of the U.S. in Southeast Asia.</p>
                    <pb n="338" xml:id="pg_338" facs="0370"/>
                    <p>The Secretary asked that the reference to an Israeli undertaking not to
                        deploy offensive missiles be eliminated. With the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> developing missiles, the US could not ask Israel to forego
                        them.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that further action with Israel and the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> should await <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>'s reply to our proposed memorandum following his
                        return from Cairo.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked why the whole problem of the Near East arms race could
                        not be given urgent consideration in the disarmament conference in Geneva.
                        He thought the proposals to Jordan and Israel could go forward and still
                        leave us room to undertake such a move.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> undertook to explore this
                        possibility with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC2">Foster</persName>.</p>

                        conversations with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> but had had
                        lengthy discussions on subject and had finally told <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> truth about where <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss>
                        negotiations stood as result of <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName>
                        visit. He said discussions with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> had not been easy and had involved separate talks
                        with Ali Amer and <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss>. He felt his argument
                        about dangers of polarization had little if any impact on <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> and final resolution of conflicting
                        positions had only been achieved with greatest difficulty.</p>
                    <p>Factor which influenced discussions was <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                        assessment of present German-Israeli arms package (septel), but key issue on
                        Jordan arms build-up was supersonics. He and <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> agreed they did not want to do anything which would
                        contribute to Israeli pressure on USG to sell 104s to Israel. On other hand
                        they understood such a sale already <pb n="339" xml:id="pg_339" facs="0371"/>consummated through Germans. However if we could give assurances 104s
                        would not be sold to Israel during period of present agreement, he would
                        withdraw request for 104s and ask for our help on Mirage. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> concurred in this. Remaining problem
                        would be finance since <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
                        insisted there would be no more <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> money
                        and Jordan must acquire its arms within funds currently pledged for this
                        purpose.</p>
                    <p>King then handed <gloss target="#t_Emboff1">EmbOff</gloss> letter to

                        Arabs for at least duration of present agreement, then Jordan will limit its

                            6:15 p.m. that day. The President met with <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>, <persName>Bundy</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName> between 6:45 and 7:39 p.m. on

                    <p>After further consideration of the Jordan Arms request, I see no alternative
                        to improving the package we have offered to King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> and agreeing to consider balanced assistance for
                        Israel. For the reasons discussed in the enclosed memorandum,<note n="2" xml:id="d155fn2">The attachment entitled “Recommendations on Near East
                            Arms,” unsigned and undated, is not printed.</note> this will require
                        coordinated actions in Amman, Tel Aviv, and Cairo. These actions will be
                        necessary to insure that the major policy shift we are making adequately
                        protects all of our interests in the area and minimizes domestic political
                        reactions.</p>
                    <p>I recommend you approve the following actions:</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Jordan </p>
                    <p>(1) Agree to sell ground force equipment costing about $42 million, including
                        100 M–48 tanks to be delivered in 1965 to 1966 rather than 1965 to 1969 as
                        originally authorized.</p>
                    <p>(2) Agree to consider selling additional ground force equipment including
                        M–48A3 tanks with the 105 mm gun with deliveries to be made from late 1967
                        through 1968.</p>
                    <p>(3) Cooperate with Jordan in finding suitable supersonic aircraft from Free
                        World sources on the understanding that, if Jordan is unsuccessful, we would
                        then tell the Jordanians we would sympathetically consider selling them 20
                        F–104s with deliveries starting in 1968 or 1969.</p>
                    <p>(4) Reach an understanding with the King that Jordan will not station tanks
                        on the West Bank.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Israel</p>
                    <p>(1) Inform Israel that if there should develop any disproportionate buildup
                        of arms on the Arab side, we will consider making selective, <pb n="341" xml:id="pg_341" facs="0373"/>direct sales on credit terms, provided
                        Israel had exhausted all other sources of supply.</p>
                    <p>(2) In return, we would expect Israel: </p>
                    <p>(a) to support quietly our Jordan program and to assist in abating opposition
                        to our aid to other Arabs and</p>
                    <p>(b) not to undertake preemptive action against Arab diversion works, but,
                        rather, take this problem to the United Nations where the United States
                        would be prepared to support the principles of the Johnston Plan.</p>
                    <p>(3) Before making any sales, we would wish Israel to accept full <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards on all their nuclear
                        facilities and to provide assurances they would not develop a nuclear
                        weapons capability.</p>
                    <p>(4) Agree to review with Israel dangers posed by Arab diversion plans.</p>

                    <head>156. Editorial Note</head>
                    <p>In a 13-minute telephone conversation on February 20, 1965, President Johnson
                        discussed the question of arms sales to Jordan with New York banker Abraham
                        Feinberg, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the American Trust Company.
                            <hi rend="italic">Feinberg</hi> said that <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">McGeorge Bundy</persName> had suggested he call because the President
                        was on the horns of a dilemma with respect to the Jordan situation and felt
                        he had not heard a clear expression of Israeli views. (Johnson indicated
                        later in the conversation <pb n="342" xml:id="pg_342" facs="0374"/>that he
                        had received indirect reports that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> was expressing opposition to arms sales to Jordan.)
                        Feinberg told Johnson that he had given <persName>Bundy</persName> a rundown
                        of the Israeli point of view as he had received it in a conversation that
                        morning. He said the way to get a clear expression of Israeli views was to
                        let Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> send Foreign
                        Minister <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Golda Meir</persName> to Washington and
                        meet with her. Johnson said they had reviewed this proposal a couple of days
                        earlier and he thought it would be “about the worst thing that could happen”
                        because it would attract worldwide attention. He said he had asked Averell
                        Harriman and <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Robert Komer</persName> to go to
                        Israel to talk to <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>, tell him the
                        importance that Johnson's advisers attached to responding to King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>'s request for arms, and obtain his
                        views.</p>
                    <p> Johnson told Feinberg: “We can go one of two ways, and I'm willing to go
                        either way. If the Israel friends in this country want to substitute their
                        judgment about the consequences of Soviet planes and don't think it makes
                        much difference, kind of like Mike Feldman argued in the meetings up here,
                        I'm prepared to tell my advisers that that is the course. I'd be perfectly
                        willing. I don't look with much approval on becoming a munitions maker.” He
                        continued in this vein, telling Feinberg that he would leave the decision to
                            <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> but making it clear that he
                        thought failure to provide arms to Jordan would lead to disastrous results.
                        He indicated that if the United States did not sell arms to Jordan, it would
                        not sell arms to Israel. His judgment and that of his advisers, he told
                        Feinberg, was that they should not let King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> “go down the river,” but “if you want to turn him
                        over and have a complete Soviet bloc—well, we'll just have to, and we'll get
                        out of the arms business.” He would let the Israelis make the decision, he
                        told Feinberg, “but it's got to be in or out. If we go in, of course we've
                        got to be of some help to Israel. If we get out, then we've just got to say,
                        well, we're not taking part, we're not going to supply arms to one side or
                        the other, we're just not going to be in here to sell a lot of
                        munitions.”</p>
                    <p> Feinberg said one of Israel's major concerns was that the United States
                        would reach an agreement with Jordan without further discussion with Israel.
                        He again raised the question of a <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName>
                        visit. Johnson again rejected it. He repeated his view of the importance of
                        selling arms to Jordan but said again that the decision was up to Israel:
                        “What I want is, I want <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> to tell
                        me what he wants to do. And I don't want him to just tell me, I want him to
                        tell the people over here what he wants to do.” He repeated that “we'll
                        furnish both of you” but if Israel did not want that, “we'll furnish
                        nobody.” (Johnson Library, Recordings and Transcripts, Recording of
                        Telephone Conversation Between Johnson and Feinberg, February 20, 1965, 11

                        million at any given time; (e) a clear understanding on <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>'s part that he must obtain outside
                        financing and that if not there will be no further deliveries; (f) no Soviet
                        arms in Jordan.</p>
                    <p>II. If, despite all your arguments, the Israelis insist that our Jordan
                        proposals are totally unacceptable, you should use the following negotiating
                        tactic. Remind them in no uncertain terms that we have made these proposals
                        primarily because of our own deep concern over Israel's security. We have no
                        major interests of our own in Jordan. We have been supporting it, at a cost
                        of roughly one-half billion dollars to date, <pb n="344" xml:id="pg_344" facs="0376"/>primarily as a means of preserving stability in the area;
                        among other things, this has been of obvious advantage to Israel. It is my
                        own judgment, buttressed by those of all of my advisers, that if we do not
                        help King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> out of his dilemma,
                        Jordan will be compelled to accept much larger quantities of Soviet arms. If
                        this occurs, we have told King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> we will have to cut off all aid. The almost certain
                        result in our judgment will be Nasserite domination of Jordan. Then Israel
                        will be hemmed in by a hostile Arab ring, with Soviet arms on the East
                        Bank.</p>
                    <p>I cannot quite understand why the Israeli Government should take such a
                        totally different view from that of all my top advisers. Is Israel prepared
                        to live with the likely result? The US can do so more easily than Israel. It
                        is hard enough for me to get foreign aid through Congress without having
                        also to defend aid to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> and aid
                        to <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>, which we regard as so
                        much in Israel's interest. At least we can save money and avoid controversy
                        in the US. But Israel must realize the likely cost to us and to it if we
                        lose much of our influence in the Arab world. Israel should be quite clear
                        that it is faced with an even more grave judgment of policy than is the
                        United States. The maintenance of some effective US presence and influence
                        in the Arab world has proved of incalculable value to the security of
                        Israel. Should the Arab world be unified and organized on the basis of
                        Nasserite and Soviet influence and direction, the threat to Israel security
                        would be fundamentally worsened. Israel should not rely upon the willingness
                        of the American people to undertake unlimited commitments under
                        circumstances where Israel's own attitude has prevented the use of diplomacy
                        to avoid a military confrontation between the tiny beachhead of Israel and
                        the combined Arab-Soviet forces which could be mobilized in that part of the
                        world. These are considerations which Israel must take into account against
                        the background of the probable attitudes of the American people as a
                        whole.</p>
                    <p>You should also make clear that, regardless of Israel's decision, the US
                        cannot accept Israeli aggressive action against Jordan simply because the
                        latter receives Soviet arms and adopts more pro-UAR policies. We opposed
                        such pre-emptive action before, and we will be compelled to oppose it
                        again—in accordance with the firm US policy last stated on 8 May 1963.</p>
                    <p>III. On the other hand, if we and Israel can reach a firm mutual
                        understanding on the wisdom of the course we propose, I am prepared to have
                        you discuss the larger Israeli political and security concerns conveyed to
                        me by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName>.</p>
                    <p>First of all, I am well aware that however much the Israeli Government might
                        itself be persuaded of our mutual interest in aid to Jordan, Prime Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> would still have acute
                        political difficulty in explaining to his electorate why US arms sales to an
                        ostensibly hostile Arab state for an overtly anti-Israeli enterprise are
                        actually the lesser <pb n="345" xml:id="pg_345" facs="0377"/>of two evils.
                        But he in turn must be brought to realize that I would have much the same
                        problem here. Moreover, if we went too far in our explanations we would
                        compromise King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>, thus
                        defeating the very purpose we seek to advance.</p>
                    <p>However, I am confident that, given mutual understanding and close
                        coordination, we can work out this political problem. What I need is to be
                        able to say privately that the Israeli Government supports what we do, even
                        if it cannot publicly applaud, and to have that Government back up my words.
                        In turn Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> needs to
                        be enabled to say that Israel's security needs can be adequately met and
                        that Israel can face the future with confidence in the strong support of its
                        friends.</p>
                    <p>Second, I gather that Israel's chief concern is over the possible growing
                        threat from the continuing buildup of Soviet arms in hostile Arab hands. Our
                        longstanding policy, which we believe to have been in Israel's interest too,
                        has been to avoid becoming a supplier of “offensive” arms to Israel or the
                        key Arab states. We have preferred that Israel look to its traditional
                        Western European sources. West Germany's cancellation of its arms aid to
                        Israel without consultation naturally was a deeply disturbing development.
                        We still prefer that Israel seek maximum help from European sources.
                        However, if there is a meeting of minds on other matters and if the US and
                        Israel agree that a disproportionate arms buildup on the Arab side is
                        developing which cannot be otherwise met, the US will make selective direct
                        sales on favorable credit terms.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> must understand that we do not
                        make such a major change in US policy lightly, and that I personally have
                        grave misgivings over the potentially disastrous effects on our relations
                        with the Arab states. Under the circumstances, we must employ the utmost
                        delicacy in making the shift and in controlling the attendant public
                        disclosure. We would expect to meet any Israeli needs on a quiet
                        case-by-case basis, with minimum attendant publicity. I would require a firm
                        pledge from <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> to collaborate fully in this
                        respect. Nor do I regard Israel as having any immediate arms needs from us.
                        We still see hope that West Germany may deliver the remaining 90 M–48 tanks
                        at issue. Even if not, Israel is getting 60 M–48s and 247 Centurions from
                        the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>. Should it become necessary, however,
                        we will later consider replacing the 90 M–48 tanks.</p>
                    <p>Third, we recognize that Israel's concerns over any expansion of Jordan's
                        forces relate largely to the geographic threat posed. King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> has assured us that he intends to
                        keep his armor on the East Bank of the Jordan. We will ask him for a firm
                        private undertaking to that effect, provided that Israel will promise to
                        keep it secret.</p>
                    <p>Fourth, Israel has raised the issue of the threat posed by the Arab
                        counter-diversion scheme and the United Arab Command buildup. You may say
                        that we are prepared to discuss this matter fully with Israel, though our
                        view of the dangers posed is considerably less alarmist than <pb n="346" xml:id="pg_346" facs="0378"/>theirs. However, we are prepared to
                        reiterate at an appropriate time both our policy of opposition to aggression
                        in the Near East and our support for the Unified Plan as an equitable
                        standard by which to judge water usage by riparian states.</p>
                    <p>IV. I regard the actions proposed by us as a major contribution to Israel's
                        security, and wish you to emphasize how they further demonstrate the firm
                        support which we have always given Israel. However, such far-reaching steps
                        must meet with a commensurate Israeli response. Therefore, in return we must
                        have certain firm undertakings from the Israeli Government. These are an
                        integral part of any program of mutual reassurances; they must be considered
                        as a package, and accepted as such. I do not propose to have Israel take
                        what it likes and then argue with us about the rest.</p>
                    <p>A. As already indicated we want Israel's quiet but unmistakable support of
                        our Jordan arms program and its help in abating opposition to our efforts to
                        maintain some sort of a presence in the other Arab states.</p>
                    <p>B. We must have a pledge of full secrecy on all matters discussed by you and
                        all subsequent actions taken until the US decides, in consultation with
                        Israel, how and when to divulge them.</p>
                    <p>C. Given the strengthening of Israeli security by the actions we contemplate,
                        we wish a firm written reiteration of Israel's intentions not to develop
                        nuclear weapons, and that Israel certify this by accepting <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards on all of its nuclear
                        facilities. So long as we receive the pledge, however, I do not insist on
                        acceptance of <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> controls now.</p>
                    <p>D. The US cannot accept Israeli pre-emptive action against the Arab diversion
                        works, but must instead have Israeli agreement to take this problem to the
                        United Nations, where the US would be prepared to support the principle of
                        the Johnston Plan.</p>
                    <p>V. Finally, I want you to emphasize that in our judgment we have only a few
                        days left before we must either sign a sales agreement with King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> or see him go the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>/Soviet route. We have stalled him past the
                        danger point. Therefore, we cannot and will not engage in extended
                        bargaining with Israel. It must decide now on which course it prefers. Our
                        choice is either to sell arms to both Israel and Jordan or to sell arms to
                        neither. We could not have been more forthcoming in our response. In turn I
                        expect Israel to display the spirit of statesmanlike understanding of US
                        problems in the Middle East which has often been lacking in the past, but
                        which can now open a new, hopeful road to the future.</p>

                        decision to you promptly on initialling memorandum of understanding along
                        lines of Sections III and IV of Presidential instructions. Meanwhile, in
                        further talks with Israelis you should point out that we regard <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards as question between us and
                        Israel, not dependent on <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> accession.
                            <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>. You will recall <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> has told us he will consider <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards when he obtains nuclear
                        reactor of sufficient size as to make question significant. End <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>. If and when we should obtain evidence
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> attempting to develop nuclear
                        capability, we would press Cairo hard to accept <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards.</p>
                    <p>On question of pre-emption in Jordan waters dispute, you will recall strong
                        objection here to asking Israel to hold its hand only “until every peaceful
                        recourse exhausted.” Phrasing in Presidential instructions accurately
                        reflects our firm view that U.S. cannot at any time accept Israeli
                        pre-emptive action against Arab diversion works, but must instead have
                        Israeli agreement to take this problem to the United Nations, where U.S.
                        would be prepared to support principles of Johnston Plan.</p>

                    <p>We can see virtue in reducing our understanding with <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> to an explicit statement. We believe that this
                        understanding should be expressed in two simultaneous separate documents.
                        The first would be a memorandum initialed by both parties along the
                        following lines:</p>
                    <p>1. The Governments of the United States and of Israel agree that full secrecy
                        shall be maintained on all matters referred to herein and all subsequent
                        actions taken in this connection, until the two Governments agree on how and
                        when to divulge them.</p>
                    <p>2. The United States agrees to review with Israel the dangers posed by the
                        Arab counter-diversion scheme and the Unified Arab Command build-up.</p>
                    <p>3. The United States is prepared to reiterate at an appropriate time both its
                        policy of opposition to aggression in the Near East and its support for the
                        Unified Plan as an equitable standard by which to judge Jordan water usage
                        by riparian states.</p>
                    <p>4. The United States will seek a firm private assurance from King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> that he intends to keep his armor
                        on the East Bank of the Jordan.</p>
                    <p>5. The United States will undertake to make selective direct sales of
                        military equipment to Israel, if the United States and Israel agree that a
                        disproportionate arms build-up on the Arab side is developing which cannot
                        be otherwise met. Any such sales would be arranged on a quiet case-by-case
                        basis, with minimum attendant publicity, after Israel had made maximum
                        efforts to obtain its requirements from Western European sources.</p>
                    <pb n="350" xml:id="pg_350" facs="0382"/>
                    <p>6. The Government of Israel pledges not to develop or obtain nuclear weapons
                        and, before any direct sale of arms is initiated, will certify this by
                        accepting <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards on all its
                        nuclear facilities.</p>
                    <p>7. Israel undertakes not to embark on preemptive action against the Arab
                        Jordan diversion works, but to utilize all peaceful recourse including the
                        United Nations.<note n="4" xml:id="d160fn4">

                        might read as follows:</p>
                    <p>“Dear Mr. President:</p>
                    <p>I greatly appreciate your consideration in sending Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> to discuss with us in depth the
                        problems our two Governments face in connection with the developing
                        situation in the Middle East. We have, I think, come to a full
                        understanding.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> has made clear the
                        concern of your Government for the maintenance of the security of Israel. On
                        my part, I want you to know that we shall be as understanding as possible in
                        helping you to meet some of the heavy responsibilities that you bear. I am,
                        therefore, prepared to assure you that the actions of my Government will
                        consistently reflect the following considerations: (1) We believe that it is
                        both necessary and useful for the US to maintain an effective influence and
                        presence in the Arab world; (2) We accept the need for the US to provide
                        certain military equipment to Jordan; (3) Should it prove necessary for the
                        US to make direct sales of military equipment to Israel we will cooperate
                        fully to minimize the resultant strains on US relations with other states in
                        the area.”</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>I opened day long sessions February 25 saying the President is following
                        closely current Israel-Arab situation. After summarizing critical world
                        security situation, I outlined our analysis of current Middle East
                        realities. I particularly stressed that it imperative Israel-Arab
                        confrontation not become polarized on West-East lines. Noting we must make
                        decision on Jordan arms within few days, I reviewed rationale this step at
                        length. Then I reiterated President's basic commitment to Israel's
                        security.</p>
                    <p>In ensuing discussion:</p>
                    <p>I emphasized significance of President's willingness to consider direct sales
                        of such military equipment as Israel needs and cannot obtain from
                        traditional sources.</p>
                    <p>I stressed essentiality there be no publicity about what we might agree re
                        principle of arms supply to Israel. I requested <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> seek quietly to influence Jewish community in US to abide
                        by such conclusions as we may reach on this and Jordan arms.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName> asked if our arms aid to
                        Jordan would continue if the Soviets gave Jordan economic aid. I stressed
                        that a major purpose of our Jordan policy was to keep Soviet influence out.
                        It came out eventually that what she had in mind was concern that Soviet
                        financial assistance directly or indirectly enable Jordan to continue water
                        diversion plan, i.e., Mukieba Dam.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> said Jordan waters issue was
                        fundamental “first test” for him. In lengthy back and forth, he urged we
                        directly press Jordanians and Lebanese to desist from cooperating in
                        diversion projects.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> bore in on arms supply problem.
                        He asked that simultaneously with our agreement to meet Jordanian arms
                        requirements as outlined by us, we commit ourselves to add to Israel's
                        deterrent by announcing we would insure it maintain adequate arms
                        balance.</p>

                    <p>He even brought up Suez transit question.</p>
                    <p>I rebutted that public declaration re our arms policy must be made at time
                        and in manner considered most opportune.</p>
                    <p>I insisted on Israel's undertaking not to strike against Arab diversion
                        projects; that she must take peaceful road, including <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, to resolve Jordan waters crisis. Subsequently I repeated
                        this theme in clearest possible formulations several times.</p>
                    <p>On nuclear question, I requested Israel's continued undertaking that it would
                        not build weapons, and would consent to <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> observation. <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>
                        agreed to reaffirm non-nuclear undertaking, but said Israel would accept
                            <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> controls “together with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>.”</p>
                    <p>I reiterated our strong feeling that we should not now announce any change in
                        our area arms policy, and in this connection, that we still have the problem
                        of Israel's acquiescence in Jordan arms deals. When there is actual US
                        delivery of weapons to Israel, we could then consider public
                        announcement.</p>
                    <p>I stressed historic significance of President's willingness to consider
                        direct arms supply in context of other understandings we seek. We pointed
                        out we have in mind Hawk-type credit terms, not grant supply. In answer to
                        my question regarding undelivered equipment under German deal, Israelis
                        seemed satisfied submarines would be delivered directly from Britain, but
                        were particularly concerned over small naval craft (Schnellbooten) as well
                        as tanks.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName> characterized Lebanon's and
                        Jordan's recent accommodations to Nasserist pressure as frightening. She
                        contended King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> would at every
                        step raise the ante by threatening to turn to Soviets. She professed to be
                        upset about recent <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> discussions of Jordan waters.</p>
                    <p>Afternoon Session </p>
                    <p>Talks almost entirely on Jordan waters, with <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName> reaching for all possible ammunition to point out
                        dangers to Johnston Plan in recourse to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.
                        Vigorous exchange followed predictable lines. I told them we are willing to
                        discuss ways and means whereby our support in principle of Johnston Plan
                        allocations could be effectuated in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                        context. We emphasized that in event Soviet veto putting Jordan waters issue
                        before world, public opinion could not help but improve Israel's case. I was
                        quite harsh in countering Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName>'s
                        scornful appreciation of Security Council's role. We stressed that when
                        Israel undertook not to launch pre-emptive military action against Arab
                        preserve, we would be willing, anytime, anywhere discuss any methods of
                        peaceful approach.</p>
                    <p>As meeting concluded, <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> asked for
                        “something in writing” re arms supply to Israel. We stressed confidential
                        nature of our discussions, <pb n="353" xml:id="pg_353" facs="0385"/>and said
                        we would consider this among other related subjects prior to 3:00 p.m.
                        meeting Friday.</p>
                    <p>Various members of <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>'s suite have
                        emphasized to our aides “necessity” for some very early public indication of
                            <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> willingness supply arms directly and
                        openly to Israel. In side conversations we have stressed that if watershed
                        in our policy is to be crossed, <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> may have
                        to steel itself to endure considerable short range domestic political

                    <p>1051. From <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName>. Our discussion
                        with Israelis this afternoon took a negative turn.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> was accompanied by Mrs.

                        previous discussions. In fact, however, he included about everything Israel
                        would like to have us committed to, including arms to Israel to counter
                        Soviet supply to Arabs. General <persName corresp="#p_RY1">Rabin</persName> then presented in graphic form present and future
                        Arab-Israel air and tank relative capabilities.</p>
                    <p>I countered by reading from memo outlining commitments we expect Israel to
                        make in conjunction with US consideration of direct supply arms to Israel as
                        based on my instructions.</p>
                    <p>After emotional statements by <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>
                        and Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName> and a cooler analysis by
                            <persName corresp="#p_PS9">Peres</persName>, it was agreed that
                            <persName corresp="#p_PS9">Peres</persName> and Levavi should meet with

                            some agreement but that the participants failed to agree on a
                            satisfactory Israeli assurance to use all peaceful recourse on the water
                            issue or on the manner in which quiet Israeli acquiescence in the Jordan
                            arms sale would be expressed. In addition, although the Israelis agreed
                            to a restatement of nuclear self-denial, they were unwilling to accept
                                <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> controls. (Ibid.)</note>

                    <p>I agreed to meet with <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> tomorrow
                        to consider outcome tonight's session. We will surely be asked to reaffirm
                        assurances to Israel we have already given. In addition, Israelis will
                        probably insist we make more definite commitment supply military equipment
                        than my instructions cover, particularly make-up 90 German tank shortfall
                        plus off-set to growing Arab strengthening of Jordan as well as improved
                        Soviet equipment to <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Possibly we may also be asked for: (a) earlier public statement than we want
                        of US agreement to direct arms supply with consideration of some grants if
                        arms race goes beyond Israel's means; (b) if peaceful effort fails to
                        control spite diversion Jordan headwaters, our non-intervention with Israeli
                        direct action.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>While Israelis still hard keep bargaining till we concede as much as
                        possible, they finally got down to brass tacks after emotional session
                        yesterday when they first saw our terms in cold print. (<persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> said no risk of their disclosing this
                        draft since it much too damaging to Israel.) <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName> later told Peres no agreement possible unless all our
                        desiderata met.</p>
                    <p>Then at fourth session I laid it on line about only alternative to US/Israeli
                        agreement, precisely as outlined in Sections II and V of <pb n="355" xml:id="pg_355" facs="0387"/>Presidential instruction. I made clear
                        consequences to Israel and US if Jordan lost to West because US decided
                        against arms deal in light Israeli opposition or because Israelis fiddled
                        while Rome burned. Asked immediate answer.</p>
                    <p>While Prime Minister was shaken, he said heart of matter was what US could
                        provide Israel. He appreciated proposed major change US policy to direct
                        sales to Israel as well as Arabs, but how could he convince his Cabinet? He
                        couldn't say that he agreed to actual US sales to Jordan, which would
                        promptly be publicized by Arabs and then seized upon by his political foes,
                        in return for generalized and secret promise US in principle agreed to
                        unspecified direct sales to Israel at some future date—and this only in
                        return for series of Israeli undertakings which could be political dynamite
                        for him. He urged we forget about other US requests, and focus on central
                        problem of precisely how US could concretely demonstrate this change in
                        policy simultaneously with Jordan arms sale.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> reviewed deterioration Israel's
                        deterrent posture since Washington intelligence talks almost year ago,
                        citing new <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>/Egypt arms deal, new
                        specter of coordinated Arab action through Unified Arab Command, and
                        cancellation German/Israel arms agreement. This created two acute problems
                        as how Israel's increased security needs to be met and how he could bring
                        his Cabinet and electorate along with him if he did what President Johnson
                        requested.</p>
                    <p>To meet security need, Israel must have hardware—planes and tanks. He
                        couldn't go to his Cabinet and get even their tacit support of US arms sales
                        to Jordan (however friendly an enemy) without showing them Israel could get
                        its hands on hardware too.</p>
                    <p>Since a deterrent balance was essential, Israel's first need was bombers to
                        create counter-threat to Soviet Badgers and IL–28's in <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, Iraqi, Syrian hands. What Israel would
                        really like was US Phantom, but he realized this impossible. Next he would
                        buy Mirage IV, but with electronics it cost $5 million per copy. So Israel
                        had decided best bet was old 1954 model B–66, which it understood US now
                        phasing out. Since Israel's resources were so limited, would we let Israel
                        buy 75 of these at cheapest second hand price ? (<persName corresp="#p_PS9">Peres</persName> had told <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName>
                        in morning that reason for 75 was that US spare parts production had ceased;
                        so Israelis would cannibalize some for spare parts.) <persName corresp="#p_PS9">Peres</persName> noted B–66 good for conventional
                        payload.</p>
                    <p>Second was Israel's need for tanks, which had been fully agreed in previous
                        Washington talks. Now Bonn had backed out. He must tell Cabinet that at
                        least Israel's previously accepted tanks needs would be met regardless,
                        especially since threat of US tanks in Jordan must now be added to that from
                        Soviet tanks in Arab hands.</p>
                    <p>Even if he agreed that the US should sell $50 million in arms to Jordan, we
                        must also see his political problem. He couldn't say merely <pb n="356" xml:id="pg_356" facs="0388"/>that the US sold tanks to Jordan because
                        this was better than Soviet tanks in Jordan. So there must be some public
                        “conjunction” between what US sold Israel and US sold Jordan. When it came
                        out that we had made arms sale to Jordan, he must be able to tell his public
                        we were going sell arms to Israel too. Once it became known that we were
                        selling tanks to Jordan he must be able say we were doing same for Israel.
                        Finally, because of new deterioration Israel's security position he must at
                        least be able to say US would sell surplus B–66 planes to Israel too. He
                        couldn't meet his acute political problem without some such coordinated
                        disclosure. Part II follows.</p>

                    <p>Part II.</p>
                    <p> US Response.</p>
                    <p>I gave <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> no encouragement. I said
                        this first we'd heard of B–66 request, and could hardly express any opinion.
                            <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> urged that I at least
                        submit to Washington. I agreed, though saying could in no way predict early
                        answer to wholly new proposal which would hit Washington cold on weekend.
                        Meanwhile Jordan matter couldn't wait.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName> took up cudgels, reminding
                            <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> that at first meeting
                            <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> had said Israel's security had
                        priority over his own political problems. Washington insisted. But one thing
                        he would say without hesitation was that, whatever US interim response,
                            <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> could not reach decision on such
                        major request quickly nor in any way accept concept of simultaneous
                        publicity. There no point even discussing this. President felt that in
                        proposing basic shift in long-standing US arms policy he had made
                        far-reaching new step toward helping meet Israel's security needs. In
                        effect, Israelis saying they could not accept US word <pb n="357" xml:id="pg_357" facs="0389"/>but must see results too. Perhaps
                        Washington might agree elaborate our offer to include promise consider tank
                        and even plane requests. But one thing certain, US was not going to invite
                        disaster like that Bonn just had with Cairo. Even if <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> prepared entertain specific arms requests, <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName> certain <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> would insist adamantly that timing and nature of disclosure
                        must be fully in US hands. No point in even referring Israeli requests to
                        Washington if simultaneous disclosure with Jordan sales also mandatory.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> granted security needs more
                        important than political requirements. If <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> prepared indicate it willing respond favorably on M–48's
                        and B–66's US could decide how matter should be publicized. However Israel
                        must be consulted. He thought he could assure compliance on secrecy. We
                        believe that meeting of minds reached on absolute US requirement for secrecy
                        insofar as possible.</p>
                    <p>I then insisted only US package proposal could be considered. As President
                        has instructed me, we could not agree even to direct arms sales in principle
                        unless other US conditions met. Will report further on these, but highlights
                        are:</p>
                    <p>A. <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> only willing reiterate
                        existing public commitment “not be first to introduce nuclear weapons into
                        Near East.” He insisted this most he able get through Israeli Cabinet. It
                        politically impossible agree on <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>
                        controls until all other major potential proliferators do so, not just
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>B. Jordan waters problem consumed most time, as in other meetings. Mrs.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName> carried ball. <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> willing give secret promise end or
                        “exhaust” all peaceful means solution but unwilling so far have any mention
                        recourse to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. Israelis also insist US agree
                        to all-out support precise allocations Johnston Plan and “oppose” any Arab
                        deviation. They propose we reserve both <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                        angle and degree US support of Johnston Plan for later full discussion.</p>
                    <p>C. As to quiet Israeli support for US arms sales to Jordan, I stressed
                        President Johnson's political requirement, which he saw as in Israel's own
                        interest. I made clear Israeli acceptance our needs here indispensable to
                        any agreement. I believe Israelis will accept our position provided other
                        matters settled.</p>
                    <p>I gave no ground on three issues above, but will submit recommendations
                        later. My comments on key issue of US arms sales follow in Part III.</p>

                    <p>Part III. Comments. We have stood foursquare on President's instructions. I
                        am also quite mindful of Secretary's desire we stick it out until
                        understanding reached. </p>
                    <p>Increasingly clear that key to matter is fact <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>, with his relatively unstable coalition government,
                        faces real difficulty in carrying his Cabinet even as far as tacit
                        acceptance US arms sales to Jordan. <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> says he can only get Cabinet acceptance Jordan arms
                        deal, and their collaboration on essential secrecy, if Cabinet can get feel
                        of actual hardware, not merely of carefully hedged statement that US will
                        eventually make some kind of direct sale.</p>
                    <p>Frankly, I believe we must give Israelis some hope on hardware if we want a
                        deal in time to give <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> his
                        answer. Minimum needed is a promise to consider favorably Israel's tank and
                        plane requests, subject of course to later agreement on type, number, price,
                        delivery schedules and timing of each step in each specific sale.</p>
                    <p>This seems relatively small added price for larger agreement we seek. It is
                        essential to lend credibility to our commitment to direct sales. Nor do I
                        see it as involving more than a spelling out of our general undertaking,
                        under which it is implicit anyway. We can't avoid selling tanks, or planes
                        either, at some point. So the more specific we can make this undertaking the
                        more quickly agreement can be reached, and the more leverage we have on
                        other points we want.</p>
                    <p>I believe that if we in position to satisfy Eshkol on provision hardware, we
                        can reach prompt meeting of minds on our desiderata at least to extent that
                        Israelis will 1) tolerate i.e. acquiesce in our Jordan arms supply and will
                        so advise their Ambassador and their key friends, 2) maintain maximum
                        secrecy re arms sales provided we agree coordinate public statements when
                        matters become public knowledge, 3) understand that US will oppose use of
                        force to preempt Arab water diversion and be prepared with our cooperation
                        to have recourse to all peaceful means to prevent such diversion, which
                        includes resort to <pb n="359" xml:id="pg_359" facs="0391"/>
                        <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> in some manner without specific mention,
                        4) reaffirm what they have already stated as to their intention not to
                        embark on nuclear weapons program, leaving question of <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> to future. We have of course not in any
                        way accepted the above, and will continue trying to improve on it. Believe
                        some chance of doing so, but am not so sanguine even in event extended
                        bargaining.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Barbour</persName> and I recommend adding some more
                        specific wording to key para on direct arms sales in 21 February 1965
                        Presidential instruction. We suggest following addition after underlined
                        portion at end of that para.<note n="2" xml:id="d165fn2">The underlined

                            <ref target="#d160">Document 160</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>(1) Add to numbered para 5 following language: “<gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> recognizes that Israel's highest priority arms need is for
                        the completion of the tank program which had been arranged with West
                        Germany. It is prepared to consider sympathetically this need if West German
                        deliveries are not completed.” </p>
                    <p>(2) Substitute following language for numbered para 6: “Israel agrees to
                        provide the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> with complete assurances
                        with respect to the non-acquisition and non-manufacture of nuclear weapons
                        and will give favorable consideration to the acceptance of <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards as soon as practicable.”</p>
                    <p>We cannot agree at this time to inject bombers into Near Eastern situation.
                        General language of numbered para 5 of course leaves it open to Israelis to
                        raise this question with us later.</p>
                    <p>Regarding substitute language on <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>, you
                        should make it clear that we cannot accept that Israeli situation is tied to
                        problems in other parts of the world rather than solely to the situation in
                        the Arab states. We can conceive of no threat of any kind to Israel from any
                        non-Arab state and in particular from such potential nuclear powers as
                        India. Language used means that at minimum we would expect Israeli
                        acceptance of <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> whenever <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> similarly accepted those
                        controls.</p>
                    <p>It may be useful for you to have in mind that <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> controls on nuclear materials can be tailored by
                        negotiation to meet specific <pb n="361" xml:id="pg_361" facs="0393"/>circumstances and conditions. For example, agreements can be either for
                        indefinite duration or a specified period. They can also include escape
                        clauses which may provide that any party can terminate on a certain period
                        of notice or that they may be terminated if a certain set of circumstances
                        materializes.</p>
                    <p>If negotiating situation makes it seem useful, you might put forward idea
                        that Israeli acceptance of <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> controls
                        could contain escape clause to effect that agreement could be terminated by
                        Israel if any Arab state acquired nuclear facilities capable of producing
                        weapons and, within a given period, refused to accept <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> or other controls satisfactory to GOI.
                        You should, however, put forward any such thought as your own idea and
                        strictly ad referendum.</p>
                    <p>We hope these amendments will enable you conclude deal 28th. We deeply
                        appreciate stout efforts and able presentation you have made during past
                        three days.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_PS9">Peres</persName> took papers to <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> and returned after one hour, just

                        <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName> deduced <pb n="362" xml:id="pg_362" facs="0394"/>from reference to continued talks that this
                        meant Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName> projected visit this
                        month. In effort to head this off <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName> urged on <persName corresp="#p_PS9">Peres</persName>
                        that Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName> visit
                        counterproductive. <persName corresp="#p_PS9">Peres</persName> commented
                        that I was only one who could say this to <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Under these circumstances I asked <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Barbour</persName> to arrange for me to see the PriMin alone instead of
                        as large group.</p>
                    <p>In this personal talk, <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> told me
                        he had discussion with Cabinet and it was impossible for him to put through
                        our proposed arrangements. He explained nothing was offered except
                        indefinite assurances. When I referred to sentence on replacement German
                        tanks he commented “sympathetic consideration” did not have the meaning to
                        the Jews that I assumed. These words had been used for years, going back to
                        the days of the Balfour Declaration, only to produce disappointments. After
                        long but calm argument as to whether US Government intentions could be
                        trusted he agreed but maintained something definite had to be settled now to
                        reassure his colleagues. He underlined changes for the worse to Israel's
                        security since his visit to Washington last June and asked why could we not
                        at least make some gesture which would justify him with his Cabinet in
                        acquiescing to our Jordan arms deal. If planes are not available why not
                        some more tanks. (He referred to the 232 M48A3s they had hoped to get,
                        against the 150 finally agreed to.)</p>
                    <p>The upshot was that he proposes Jordan deal be held up a week. Peres and
                        General <persName corresp="#p_RY1">Rabin</persName> go to Washington
                        quietly at once to review change in Israel's military situation with the
                        hope that a specific deal can be agreed to for a limited amount of hardware
                        (a few tanks or planes). <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> would
                        then expect to get his Cabinet to go along with Jordan sale, and agree to no
                        publicity on our arms sales to Israel as we want.</p>
                    <p>I had previously told him Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName> was
                        not the one to send to Washington. I had to admit however that the matters
                        relating to peaceful methods, including recourse to United Nations on the
                        Jordan water problem, were in her field. <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> suggested we work together in any way we wanted to
                        explore all peaceful means to deal with this problem. Israel wanted more
                        than anyone a peaceful way to get its share of the water. <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> assured me I could state to the
                        President that Israel had no military intentions at the present time and
                        that certainly no action would be taken while they were working with us on
                        every possible peaceful solution. Eshkol agreed to carry on discussions with
                        us on this subject in any way or in any place we wanted.</p>
                    <p>On nuclear problem <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> again gave
                        assurance Israel had no plans for development nuclear weapons. He accepted
                        my statement that the President felt one of his chief world responsibilities
                        was to prevent nuclear proliferation, particularly since Red China's
                        detonation, and said he wanted to cooperate. However he explained he could
                            <pb n="363" xml:id="pg_363" facs="0395"/>not get his AE Commission to
                        accept <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> without some specific
                        consideration such as <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> agreeing
                        as well. However he wanted to assure the President Israel wanted to help and
                        would not make the President's task more difficult.</p>
                    <p>Taking the above and my previous talks into consideration, I recommend that
                        (1) We divide up our package—I think we will do better with them separately.
                        (2) <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> be permitted to send
                            <persName corresp="#p_PS9">Peres</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_RY1">Rabin</persName> to Washington quietly, and <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> be held off for a week. (3) Dept
                        after consultation with <persName corresp="#p_SAEII1">Stevenson</persName>
                        decide how to proceed with Israel on Jordan water problem. (4) We continue
                        our pressure on <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> inspection nuclear
                        facilities in context of nuclear problem.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> is not dominant in Israel. He
                        is well meaning but does not control. I feel that in the long run we will do
                        better with him if we try to understand his political problems and negotiate
                        realistically on each matter. He knows tough trading, but is susceptible to
                        friendly understanding.</p>
                    <p>I have an engagement with <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>
                        tomorrow afternoon to take my leave and hopefully to give him an answer. I
                        urgently ask for a reply to this message, and approval of my departure for
                        Kabul tomorrow, Monday midnight.</p>
                    <p>Regret I haven't been able to bring home the bacon but feel that much has
                        been accomplished in calming Israeli emotions on our providing arms to
                        Jordan and the ground has been prepared for reasonable future understandings

                    <p>For four days we have vigorously pressed Israelis to accept formal package
                        deal covering all key aspects US/Israel relations except economic aid and
                        desalting. Effort today, tabling our proposed memo of understanding and
                        letter as reconfirmed by President, convinces us no quick agreement possible
                        along these lines, even with sweetener that we'd now consider
                        “sympathetically” replacement 90 tanks.</p>
                    <p>Partly for bargaining purposes, but also because of domestic political
                        reasons and Israel's particular psychology, they refuse (1) deny themselves
                        any later nuclear option by accepting <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>
                        controls; (2) utterly forswear residual right of pre-emption on water issue
                        they consider vital; or (3) be required go <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. What they get in return is generalized promise we will in
                        principle sell arms direct but only if there is agreed need, no other
                        supplier, etc. Without minimizing great importance this commitment, it not
                        sufficient enable US pressure Israelis into signing within three days such a
                        broad series of undertakings affecting all their vital security
                        concerns.</p>
                    <p>But our failure get Israelis sign firm written contract in language we want
                        should not blind us to degree of broad understanding achieved. We have (1)
                        satisfactory contingent promise to support tacitly Jordan arms deal; (2)
                        renewed undertaking not to go nuclear, which in itself highly important,
                        despite fact Israelis flatly unwilling brave domestic political storm or
                        deprive selves of nuclear option by accepting IAEA controls; (3) assurance
                        they won't use early force against Arab diversion scheme—in fact Israelis
                        even willing have US take case to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, though
                        they won't do so themselves; and (4) Israeli agreement to maintain secrecy
                        about any US/Israel arms transactions, provided we willing consult with them
                        about how to handle such matters when they become public sooner or later.
                        Depending on how long Hussein will wait, and on how tough we willing be,
                        further hard bargaining might even bring Israelis around a bit further on
                        recourse to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and accepting <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> controls if <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> did.</p>
                    <p>But to get these assurances more firmly tied down, and above all to get
                        Israelis' cooperation on handling Jordan arms deal, will require more give
                        on our part, firmer promise to supply tanks and/or planes. In my judgment,
                        this true whether we reach understanding now or later.</p>
                    <p>We've all but accused Israelis of doubting <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>'s pledged word and of grievously overbidding, but fact that
                        Israel's primary interest is in such security needs evident from <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>'s wish send <persName corresp="#p_PS9">Peres</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_RY1">Rabin</persName> to Washington instead of <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Golda Meir</persName> (though our hints <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName> visit would not be productive helped).</p>
                    <p>Israelis want to prolong negotiations and shift to Washington, because they
                        think they need, and can get, more than we willing give as yet. They willing
                        take risk Jordan will go sour, or even that US will go ahead with Jordan
                        arms sale in absence prior understanding here.</p>
                    <pb n="365" xml:id="pg_365" facs="0397"/>
                    <p>In this tough impasse, we see three alternatives:</p>
                    <p>A. Go ahead and sign with Jordan, depending on Israeli desire for proffered
                        compensation to inhibit Israel from overreacting. Odds are <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> would keep still for time being,
                        while negotiating with Washington. But Israelis would naturally threaten
                        blowup unless we came through pronto on tanks and planes. Moreover, risk of
                        leaks here would be substantial in absence prior Cabinet agreement.</p>
                    <p>B. Try for quick deal covering only immediate Jordanian problem. We could
                        tell Eshkol we'd provide 90 tanks before end 1965 if Germans finally
                        cancelled, provided he in turn agreed to quiet support on Jordan deal
                        pending negotiation of other issues. We strongly doubt this salable but
                        could try.</p>
                    <p>C. While <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> must leave, we could
                        still forestall new round negotiations Washington by having <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Barbour</persName> continue talks here. In many
                        respects we close enough to acceptable formulation to offer hope. However,
                        no point in continuing here unless we prepared say something more positive
                        about tanks and/or planes.</p>
                    <p>All here feel unavoidable implication our own formula on “direct sales” if
                        necessary is that at the least we must sell tanks, since only other M–48
                        supplier now gone. Israelis keep harping on fact that we accepted Israeli
                        need for at least 300 tanks as long ago as November 1963. Since then,
                        Soviets have delivered many more tanks to Arabs, and we've delivered 48 to
                        Jordan. Now we propose sell 100 more, besides delivering another 48 gratis
                        under <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>. So we're hooked for tanks, and
                        for more than 90 too.</p>
                    <p>As to planes, Israelis point out that Soviets have already “injected”
                        literally hundreds of jet bombers into Near East. Why are we so reluctant?
                        However, I sense that Israeli interest in B–66s less urgent than previously
                        thought. General Weizmann today said B–66 marginal; he much preferred French
                        Vautour if only US could help pay for it. When I replied <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> unwilling do business with us,
                        even for Israel, he suggested we help buy <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                        Spey engines for Vautour.<note n="3" xml:id="d168fn3">This conversation was

                    <p>Washington will have to decide whether quick agreement with Israelis
                        essential enough to pay the price. All I urge is that we make this decision
                        in full recognition we'll sooner or later have to give Israelis some further
                        indication our arms sales intentions. Pressures will become intense as
                        Jordan waters crisis mounts. Also, sooner we do so the more we can get,
                        particularly in way of firm Israeli secrecy pledges <pb n="366" xml:id="pg_366" facs="0398"/>without which the policy shift forced on us
                        by Jordan arms deal will be all the more risky. Am sure it possible cook up
                        some formula which will satisfy Israelis while not materially reducing our
                        leverage, since we can still stall on many related issues of price,
                        delivery, publicity, etc. Will need such formula for <persName corresp="#p_PS9">Peres</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_RY1">Rabin</persName> visit, since this whole purpose of their coming.</p>
                    <p>In sum, we seven months pregnant on arms sales to Israel as well as Jordan.
                        If we sell to Jordan, we must sell to Israel too. If we don't sell to
                        Jordan, Soviets will. Then we'll have to sell to Israel anyway. So we must
                        compare risk of greater commitment to tanks and planes now against risk in
                        having to make these later anyway with far less in way of return commitments
                        than we can get today.</p>

                            <ref target="#d167">Documents 167</ref> and <ref target="#d168">168</ref>.</note> We do not believe that further delays are
                        desirable or practicable. The issues have been fully explored in great
                        detail. What is now required are some hard decisions by the Israeli and
                        United States Governments on questions to which there are no easy answers.
                        Time is an urgent factor because we cannot be certain that the movement of
                        the Arab bloc into <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s control
                        and Soviet domination will not occur very fast if we are unable to proceed
                        with Jordan. <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss> aircraft could arrive in
                        Jordan from Egypt within a week or two. Problem is now that of understanding
                        of facts in the Arab world as they affect Israeli and U.S. interests.
                        Therefore, if you are unable to obtain a final agreement on basis this
                        telegram, <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName> should remain behind
                        to assist Barbour for further immediate discussions while you proceed on
                        your schedule.</p>
                    <p>We fully understand the domestic difficulties which Israeli Government faces
                        in connection with decisions it must make. But these difficulties <pb n="367" xml:id="pg_367" facs="0399"/>must be faced because of the
                        decisions which are necessary to protect Israeli security and U.S. vital
                        interests in the Near East, which include Israeli security. It seems to us
                        that Israel is not so alarmed as we about the prospect of solidification of
                        the Arab world under <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s
                        leadership with, in effect, a close working alliance with the Soviet Bloc.
                        We had supposed that this would be the strongest imaginable threat to Israel
                        security. Israel apparently has another view. If that is their considered
                        judgment, we cannot force them to take another course but it would be
                        necessary for us to consider most seriously whether we attempt to involve
                        ourselves any longer in the problems of Near Eastern security. There should
                        be no misunderstanding that the obligation of the United States Government
                        is to act on the basis of the interests of 190 million Americans. And there
                        should be no misunderstanding that Americans expect this of the United
                        States Government.</p>
                    <p>From your 1064 we gather that <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>'s
                        principal problem is that he does not feel that he has a specific and firm
                        commitment from us about military hardware. You should tell him that we have
                        not been anxious to reduce these matters to specifics because (1) we do not
                        yet know whether the West Germans will in fact complete their tank
                        deliveries and (2) a flat commitment leaked to the press would make it
                        extremely difficult for us to move diplomatically in support of U.S. and
                        Israeli interests in our discussions with Arab governments. Nor do we wish
                        to lose freedom of action in discussions with the Germans about their future
                        course.</p>
                    <p>However, if <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> feels he must have
                        something specific, you can tell him, and include in the memorandum of
                        understanding, that if West Germany does not complete its delivery of tanks
                        under the original arrangement, the United States itself will provide those
                        tanks. You can also tell him that we will give careful consideration to
                        further tanks if the general security situation in the Near East requires
                        it.</p>
                    <p>We do not believe that we should make specific commitments at this time about
                        further military hardware, such as planes, which Israel can always raise
                        under the general language already proposed in the Memorandum of
                        Understanding. You should not, however, encourage them to believe that they
                        can get jet bombers merely by asking for them.</p>
                    <p>You should again make it clear to <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> that the decision to sell arms to Israel, even on the
                        proposed basis, creates major problems for the United States in supporting
                        U.S. and Israeli interests in the Arab world and you should make it clear
                        again that this decision has been a major development in U.S. policy. You
                        should also make it clear that if Israel makes it difficult for us to
                        support U.S. and Israeli interests in the Arab world, they force upon us a
                        fundamental reexamination of our role in the Near East.</p>
                    <pb n="368" xml:id="pg_368" facs="0400"/>
                    <p>Please be sure that <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> understands
                        we cannot accept the idea that we should proceed to assist in the arming of
                        Israel when we are on notice Israel plans to take preemptive military action
                        with respect to Jordan waters. We will not support such preemptive action.
                        We will continue to support in every way Israel's right to a share of Jordan
                        waters within the framework of the Unified Plan. But we cannot leave any
                        implication that we will support an Israeli military initiative leading to
                        war in the Near East over this problem. You should further attempt to put
                        this question into the background by insisting that our best information is
                        that there will be very considerable time before Arab diversion of such
                        waters could possibly affect Israel's share under the Unified Plan and that
                        we shall do our best to support the Unified Plan by all other means.</p>
                    <p>You should further underline that the United States cannot support any
                        Israeli flirtation with nuclear weapons. On nuclear matters, the United
                        States is as old as Methuselah and utterly cold-blooded in terms of U.S.
                        vital interests. We shall resist with every resource at our command the
                        dissemination of nuclear weapons into the Near East. We shall try to find
                        ways to bring the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> into <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards but there should be no
                        misunderstanding between us and Israel as to our view of Israeli acquisition
                        of such weapons.</p>
                    <p>If the above instruction about being specific about tanks does not open the
                        way for the final agreement we seek, then <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Barbour</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName>
                        should stay with it until we get such agreement. There is nothing that can
                        be said in Washington that cannot be said in Jerusalem. (<gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>. This means President does not want agree

                        insertion of following sentence at end of first paragraph: “these exchanges

                    <p>We have some reservation about issuance of agreed communique, which would
                        stimulate rather than suppress speculation. You might point out to <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> that, in your new role as
                        Ambassador-at-large, you do not wish to set precedent of formal communiques
                        since you will be visiting many capitals informally from time to time, and
                        communiques become a complicating factor.</p>
                    <p>Let me conclude with point made at beginning, namely, that we are prepared to
                        make extremely difficult decisions in support of Israel's security in the
                        Near East, decisions which will greatly complicate American <pb n="369" xml:id="pg_369" facs="0401"/>interests in that part of the world. What
                        is called for is equally difficult decisions by Israel. They should know
                        that if we cannot make these decisions jointly, they cannot assume that
                        their decisions can be supported by the U.S. The President has a deep
                        commitment to the security and well being of Israel but he wants their help
                        on matters involving both the vital interests of the U.S. and our ability to
                        help Israel.</p>
                    <p>Many thanks for your fine effort. We will keep trying to give <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Barbour</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName> quick answers to help them reach agreement, no matter

                    <p>1075. Personal for Secretary from <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName>. Your message confirms again the difficulty of
                        communication by telegraph that I have known since my 1920 international
                        banking days. I can assure you that all the points you make have been
                        underscored with <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> et al to point
                        of rudeness. Your telegram makes assumptions that should not be read into
                            <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>'s words. We are not on
                        notice that Israel intends military action. It wants to avoid such action
                        but it will not give up its sovereign rights on the basis of a general
                        assurance that we will help them get their share of water. Israelis want to
                        know precisely what we are going to do in support of peaceful means. They
                        certainly believe that the threat of military action is something to keep
                        holding over Arabs as an essential in any negotiations.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> assures me Israel is not
                        flirting with nuclear weapons but they are not willing to commit themselves
                        irrevocably at least until they know Egyptian intentions. Their suspicions
                        are aroused and I could not allay them to point of forever giving up threat
                        they might go nuclear, which they see as of value in deterring <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> aggression.</p>
                    <p>They believe <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s threats that he
                        intends to obliterate them if he can. Experience with Hilter's threats is
                        too recent to be forgotten.</p>
                    <pb n="370" xml:id="pg_370" facs="0402"/>
                    <p>I have told Israelis unmistakably that proposed change in U.S. policy means
                        we will give careful consideration to their residual arms needs “if the
                        general security situation in the Near East requires it.” They have answered
                        and firmly believe that the security situation in the Near East has already
                        deteriorated since last June, even before our proposal to supply tanks and
                        other material to increase Jordan's military capacity. They ask that we face
                        these facts together now in Jerusalem or in Washington. I am meeting with
                            <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> again with <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Barbour</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName> in Jerusalem this afternoon and I can assure we all
                        will do everything possible to achieve purposes outlined.</p>
                    <p>We agree impolitic for me to remain longer, but that <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName> should stay with <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Barbour</persName> to continue negotiations. As
                        procedural matter, however, he cannot “assist <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Barbour</persName>” when he has just recently been here as private
                        Presidential emissary. <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Barbour</persName>

                        telegram 847 was not intended to reflect slightest doubt regarding clarity,
                        vigor and force with which you have presented our views during these past
                        four difficult days. On contrary, we can see from your reporting that you
                        have stood very firm against powerful onslaught.</p>
                    <p>Forceful reiteration in my telegram of points already essentially covered in
                        your initial instructions was intended simply to give you renewed authority
                        to press Israelis to utmost. It reflected continuing and growing feeling by
                        the President that there are limits beyond which we cannot go in support of
                        Israel. He wanted you to be sure that even the strong case which <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> has made on Israel's behalf could not
                        be <pb n="371" xml:id="pg_371" facs="0403"/>allowed to override what he
                        considers to be basic interest of US. If we cannot pursue a policy which
                        enables us to further our overall interests in the Middle East, he would
                        prefer to shift responsibility for that area's stability to other hands.</p>

                    <p>For <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">McGeorge Bundy</persName> from <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName>.</p>
                    <p>1. Need your help in resolving apparent failure effective communications
                        between Washington and here evident from Eyes Only Deptel 847.<note n="2" xml:id="d172fn2">
                            <ref target="#d169">Document 169</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>2. Well realize Washington may think we need be bucked up, but we've already
                        made and remade every point Deptel 847 in far stronger terms, especially on
                        nuclear weapons. I'm surprised Israelis still speak to me. Also Harriman
                        told them flatly that if they used force on Jordan waters US would be “spang
                        up” against them.</p>
                    <p>3. Realize Washington worried about mounting Arab counterpressures, but as
                            <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> says even Soviets are
                        less tough bargainers than Israelis. <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Barbour</persName> and
                        I convinced what set back talks was draft <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> letter to President we instructed propose. We can get
                        credible assurances if we prepared pay price, but not in this form.</p>
                    <p>4. In line Deptel we'll threaten again to turn against Israelis if they don't
                        play ball, but this not too credible. Also sure President doesn't want us
                        break too much crockery at time US aid to Arabs already under fire, we
                        trying get new aid bill through Congress, and we face major Jordan water
                        crisis. Nor can we say too loudly we'll withdraw from Middle East and let
                        chips fall where they may.</p>
                    <pb n="372" xml:id="pg_372" facs="0404"/>
                    <p>5. Crux of matter is that these people have received so many broken promises
                        in their long history of dealings with great powers that they must get more
                        than general statements we'll help them out with arms. Though we've said
                        till we're blue in face that they can and must trust US word, no mistaking
                        their determination keep negotiating, if possible in Washington, till they
                        get more on arms.</p>
                    <p>6. Moreover, let's put ourselves in their shoes and realize we're asking for
                        several specific pledges on matters they regard as essential their security,
                        in return for very unspecific pledges on our part. True, they need us more
                        than we need them, but we can't high pressure them in a few days to settle
                        matters we've been arguing about for several years. At any rate, we can't do
                        so without a little more flexibility.</p>
                    <p>7. As I tried indicate in Embtels 1060 and 1068,<note n="3" xml:id="d172fn3">
                            <ref target="#d165">Documents 165</ref> and <ref target="#d168">168</ref>.</note> there must be some way to be specific enough to
                        meet <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>'s needs without really
                        robbing us of much freedom of action. We're buying so little by delaying the
                        inevitable that I conclude State's chief worry is leaks here which could
                        grievously harm us with Arabs. I couldn't agree more, but let's carefully
                        examine risk of general contingent commitments we have in effect already
                        given without getting firm pledge of secrecy versus risks of leak slightly
                        more specific commitments for which we can get strongest secrecy pledges.
                        Frankly, we're already compromised by leakage German deal, imperatives of
                        selling to Israel once we sell to Jordan, and resultant offers we've already
                        been authorized make here. So risk to us in going slightly farther seems to
                        me far less than risks we already courting.</p>
                    <p>8. Any mileage in getting <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> to
                        look at possible Vautour deal mentioned Embtel 1068?</p>
                    <p>9. Finally, remember time pressure is requiring us use such strenuous tactics
                        to force Israeli hand that they've probably concluded they can either bid up
                        price now or get further delay while they keep bargaining. Though we've told
                        them they must choose whether to lose Jordan, trouble is they know we are in
                        a bind.</p>
                    <p>10. I'll stay here pushing hard but urge you help get us minimum necessary to
                        put across early deal, US itself needs as much as Israel at this point. Even
                        so, across-the-board package deal so complex and involves so many gut
                        issues, that breaking up package in favor of more limited understanding
                        along lines alternative B in Embtel 1068 may be best we can get. We just
                        can't settle water issue here and now. My personal view is alternative A
                        shouldn't be ignored either, but this probably too risky.</p>

                        Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName> participating, I believe I
                        laid on the line all points covered in your message 849<note n="2" xml:id="d173fn2">The reference is apparently to telegram 848 to Tel
                            Aviv, <ref target="#d171">Document 171</ref>. Telegram 849 to Tel Aviv,
                            sent to Amman as telegram 493, March 1, concerned arms for Jordan.

                            <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName> by prearrangement filling
                        in for double emphasis. We reviewed sentence by sentence memorandum of
                        understanding, including authorized modification. I believe I am now in a
                        position to advise what we can get in the way of an agreement with the GOI
                        in time to deal with the Jordan arms arrangements.</p>
                    <p>I hate to leave before completing job but under circumstances think my
                        continued highly publicized presence any longer is counterproductive.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> agreed it politic for me to
                        leave tonight and appeared pleased that <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName> would stay on with earnest desire of reaching some
                        understanding.</p>
                    <p>A. To cover the most vital subjects first:</p>
                    <p>(1) Israel's non-proliferation commitment: <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> has no intention of undertaking nuclear arms
                        development under present circumstances and will restate whatever he has
                        said before, including that Israel pledges it will not be the first to bring
                        or develop nuclear arms into the Middle East. Constitutionally, he can not
                        go much further without full Cabinet and Israel <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> Commission support with attendant public discussion,
                        particularly as <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> Chairman is a political
                        opponent of <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Net of this is that our earnest talks, plus my appeal to <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> to be the President's first supporter
                        of non-proliferation has done some good for long pull. But it is clear that
                        it is not politically possible for <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> to do more than the above, without long and full
                        analysis of this problem, including deterrent effect of keeping [garble]
                        guessing plus <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> technical problems.</p>
                    <p>In sum I recommend that we not attempt to force Israelis beyond what
                            <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> can do at this time.</p>
                    <pb n="374" xml:id="pg_374" facs="0406"/>
                    <p>(2) The most pressing problem is Israel's Jordan River water rights. I am
                        sure the President understands, far better than I do, that water rights in
                        our Western tradition are fundamental to land rights. Interference with
                        water rights is to Israelis as fundamental as invasion of territory.</p>
                    <p>Israelis will not agree in advance never to use force to protect the water to
                        which we have agreed they entitled under Johnston Plan. They will agree to
                        state affirmatively that they will use all peaceful means to protect their
                        water rights as agreed to by us, and that they will explore with us and
                        utilize every peaceful method to achieve these ends. However, they will not,
                        and nothing will persuade them renounce ultimate use of force to protect
                        their water any more than they would renounce use of force to protect their
                        territory.</p>
                    <p>We must recognize also that use of force has varying degrees. I saw yesterday
                        area where Syrian bulldozers were clearing the ground for diversion canal
                        within a few hundred yards of Israeli border. One heavy machine gun could
                        knock them out. Considering that last night Jordanian terrorists invaded
                        Israeli territory 5 miles to blow up inhabited house, Israelis do not
                        believe warning to Arabs on water will produce full-scale war. However they
                        will agree not to use force till all peaceful means exhausted or preferably
                        affirmatively state that they earnestly seek peaceful means of protecting
                        their water sources. They will agree explore with us and utilize any and all
                        peaceful means to this end.</p>
                    <p>A provision along these lines is negotiable, but we can not expect a
                        renunciation under all circumstances of the use of force to protect Israel's
                        water.</p>
                    <p>B. On the minutiae of memorandum of understanding. In paragraph 2 Israelis
                        don't understand phrase “counter-diversion.” They request “counter” be
                        dropped and suggest paragraph read “Both governments agree to review the
                        dangers posed by Arab diversion schemes and the Unified Arab Command
                        buildup.”</p>
                    <p>In paragraph 3 Israelis are highly suspicious of phrase Johnston Plan “an
                        equitable standard by which to judge Jordan water usage by riparian states.”
                        They fear this means a major change of U.S. policy. I urge we stop using
                        fancy new language and tell Israelis we will support their right to water as
                        provided in Johnston Plan.</p>
                    <p>Greatest difficulty in wording is in paragraph 5. Israelis feel we have
                        insured ourselves three times against any possibility of U.S. direct arms
                        sales. I do hope draft will be reviewed and we recognize that we have to
                        convince Israelis we mean to sell them something. So I urge we drop word
                        “selective” (it means nothing anyway) and combine last phrase of first
                        sentence with last phrase of second sentence so that we state only once our
                        expectation all reasonable Israeli efforts to get arms <pb n="375" xml:id="pg_375" facs="0407"/>from Western Europe. Also I urge that
                        “maximum effort” be amended to read “every reasonable effort.” With these
                        changes <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName> can work out
                        (acceptable) wording for this paragraph.</p>
                    <p>C. Given changes along lines A and B above, <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Barbour</persName> and I
                        believe we can make a deal promptly for Israeli acquiescence both here and
                        in Washington in US arms sales to Jordan.</p>
                    <p>It is of course for Washington to decide whether we wish to abandon Jordan
                        deal or do it without Israeli acquiescence. Either of these has its domestic
                        and international risks.</p>
                    <p>For my part I earnestly recommend to you and the President that you accept
                        our combined advice to get the best possible on the Jordan arms deal
                        described above, and leave to future negotiations the other difficult
                        problems we have to face with Israel. We always have the leverage of
                        stopping arms delivery if Israelis misbehave. They know they must keep in
                        our good graces, but we must understand in turn that we are dealing with a
                        dedicated people who will not abdicate their right to survival.</p>
                    <p>In leaving I want to express my deep gratitude for the unbelievably prompt
                        responses you have given me at the most inconvenient hours and with I
                        realize, other taxing pressures. Many thanks.</p>

                            the Israeli Embassy raised the question of whether the language used by
                                <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName> about the Unified Plan and Jordan

                            discussions with the Israelis in January and February 1964, especially
                            in the memorandum given Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> on January 24, 1964. (See <ref target="#d11">Document 11</ref>.) Telegram 854 asked how deeply <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName>'s and <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName>'s talks had gone into questions
                            such as allocations, transfers from Lebanon to Syria and Jordan, and the
                            possibility of renegotiation and whether the Israelis seemed alarmed at
                            the U.S. attitude on questions of this type as contrasted with the U.S.

                        of difficult argument here has been over language our brief on Johnston
                        Plan.</p>
                    <p>Israeli alarm bells rang from moment we started speaking of US willingness
                        express support of “the principles of the Unified Plan (Deptel 823,<note n="3" xml:id="d174fn3">
                            <ref target="#d160">Document 160</ref>.</note> para 7) or that US
                        supported Johnston Plan” as equitable standard by which to judge water
                        rights of riparian states (Deptel 823, para 3).</p>
                    <p>Israelis kept asking what this fancy new language meant. Did we still support
                        Johnston Plan or not? They said this reaffirmed all fears aroused recently
                        by <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName>'s evasiveness, letter to
                        Mrs. Sisto, etc., etc.</p>
                    <p>Israelis regard us as committed to Johnston Plan as a whole. They keep coming
                        up with new references to the record to sustain their stand. Clearly their
                        tactics are going to be to hold us as much as possible to letter of
                        plan.</p>
                    <p>While this is obviously a bargaining position, they mean to play it to hilt
                        as long as possible and beyond present round of discussions. As Eshkol keeps
                        saying, “It is ok if Lebanon takes 35 MCM's of water but not if it takes 36
                        or 40.” However, <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> in aside to me
                        Monday said, “Don't take away our whole basis for compromise. Don't try to
                        make us compromise at the beginning of a crisis rather than at the end.”</p>
                    <p>He gets the issue clearly, and <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> said in return that we obviously weren't going to
                        let Israel tie us down to last letter of Johnston Plan, which only agreed to
                        by Israel, not Arabs. Our firm policy was to see that Israel got the water
                        to which it was entitled.</p>
                    <pb n="377" xml:id="pg_377" facs="0409"/>
                    <p>They then cited President Johnson's 2 Jan. 1964 letter to the P.M.,<note n="4" xml:id="d174fn4">
                            <ref target="#d1">Document 1</ref>.</note> delivered by Sargent Shriver,
                        which said, “We stand behind you in your rights of withdrawal in accordance
                        with the Unified Plan.” We said this still our policy, but not that Arab
                        part of plan was inviolable.</p>
                    <p>Stripped of all diplomatese, Israelis see US as slipping away from them on
                        Jordan waters issue, in interests of promoting some other form of
                        compromise. Relevant phrases in our memo of understanding, which I regret to
                        say were not fully understood by me at White House nor properly flagged by
                        me for President, have greatly heightened their suspicions. They think our
                        next step will be to say they don't really have to go to war if 320 MCM
                        allocation is shaded slightly. After all, they'd still get most of the water
                        they need. This in turn adds greatly to their reluctance give up their own
                        right of pre-emption in exchange for wobbly promise of US support.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Barbour</persName> and I fully agree US cannot
                        let Israelis so tie us down to letter of Johnston Plan that we lose any
                        flexibility in necessary effort work out some new form of peaceful
                        compromise. But manner in which we have sought to evade this issue has
                        inflamed Israeli suspicions and greatly complicated our negotiating
                        task.</p>
                    <p>Deptel 854 shows Dept. still evading issue, while we believe it must be
                        squarely faced. We recommend (and know <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> does) that we stand firmly on statement in
                        President's Jan. 1964 letter to <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>
                        and on <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName>'s statement here,
                        that we support Israel's right to water allocated to it under Johnston
                        Plan.</p>
                    <p>This gives us half a loaf of freeing us on Arab portion of plan. It gives
                        Israelis half a loaf by quieting their fears we're beginning to renege on
                        their allocation of Jordan waters too. Moreover, it gives us good public
                        position in Israel and elsewhere against which Israelis will find it hard to
                        make convincing arguments.</p>

                    <p>865. For Ambassador and <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName>. The
                        President has decided that in view of Israeli difficulties with the proposal
                        carried by <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName>, as subsequently
                        modified at Israeli insistence, we might now take another track. You should
                        inform <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> that while we cannot
                        wait longer to go forward with our agreement with Jordan, which as Israelis
                        aware we consider in mutual interest of Israel and <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>, we recognize Israeli concerns. In view of Israeli
                        hesitation in accepting proposal presented by <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> with subsequent modifications we were able to make,
                        we are now prepared to make following alternative offer.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> is prepared to sell military
                        equipment to Israel comparable in quantities and kinds to the equipment that
                        the United States sells to Jordan to preclude the Soviet supply of arms
                        through the <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> to Jordan. The United States
                        regards such sales as an exception to its existing policy and not as
                        creating any precedent for the future.</p>
                    <p>Condition is that if <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> accepts above offer,
                        it must make a commitment not to oppose our offer to Jordan and to keep all
                        aspects entire agreement completely secret until both governments agree on
                        appropriate publicity.</p>
                    <p>We would expect a letter from <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>
                        confirming this understanding along following lines:</p>
                    <p>“Dear Mr. President:</p>
                    <p>I greatly appreciate your consideration in sending Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> to discuss with us in depth the
                        problems our two Governments face in connection with the developing
                        situation in the Middle East. We have, I think, come to a full
                        understanding.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> has made clear the
                        concern of your Government for the maintenance of the security of Israel. On
                        my part, I want you to know that we shall be as understanding as possible in
                        helping you to meet some of the heavy responsibilities that you bear. I am,
                        therefore, pleased to assure you that Israel will utilize all peaceful means
                        to ensure protection of its share of Jordan waters and that we are willing
                        to indicate publicly that Israel will not be the first to acquire or develop
                        a nuclear weapons capability in the Arab-Israel area. For our part, (1) we
                        understand that it is both necessary and useful for the <pb n="379" xml:id="pg_379" facs="0411"/>US to seek to maintain an effective
                        influence and presence in the Arab world; (2) we accept the need for the US
                        to provide certain military equipment to Jordan; and (3) we welcome the
                        willingness of the US Government to sell military equipment to Israel
                        comparable in quantities and kinds to the equipment the US sells to Jordan
                        to preclude the Soviet supply of arms through the <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> to Jordan. My government understands that the US regards
                        such sales as an exception to its existing policy and not as creating any
                        precedent for the future.”</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>. It is entirely possible that Prime
                        Minister will find this less attractive than broader understanding on which
                        we have been working. But there would be some advantage to us in having
                        record show that, insofar as U.S. concerned, our only departure from
                        longstanding policy (arms to Jordan) was balanced by corresponding offer to
                        Israel. He may wish to return to more general discussion. You should report
                        back any counter proposals he makes, specifically in having before him
                        drafts of letter we think he should write President. What kind of letter
                        does he think he can write President?</p>
                    <p>You should know we feel this matter should be brought to conclusion now
                        rather than ending up in any special emissary or delegation to Washington.
                        End <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>.</p>

                        turn comprehend our own deeply held concerns.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Nuclear Developments</p>
                    <p>All indications are toward Israeli acquisition of a nuclear capability. There
                        is little realization in Israel of the intensity of U.S. opposition to
                        nuclear proliferation. U.S. hesitation and delays in pressing for the recent
                        inspection of the Dimona reactor plus the failure to insist upon a two-day
                        visit have led the Israelis to believe we are not serious. Some embassy
                        officers believe we may run into difficulty in arranging the next visit.</p>
                    <p>Israeli officials and public appear firmly to believe that the U.A.R. will
                        have a nuclear capability within 5 to 7 years. Planning for Israeli
                        acquisition of a comparable capability is moving forward on this assumption.
                        The Science Attache has calculated that the target date for acquisition of a
                        nuclear weapons capability by Israel is 1968–9. He has discovered
                        information indicating that Israel has already acquired the know-how for
                        Plutonium metal production. There is no need for sizeable domestic ore
                        production facilities since Argentina has been a ready source.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Barbour</persName> is convinced Israel
                        fears U.A.R. acquisition of a nuclear capability and believes it must
                        prepare for the time this occurs. He also believes a psychological case can
                        be made for U.A.R. development of a “radiological garbage bomb.” The <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>, of course, has exploited this issue
                        publicly.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Barbour</persName> does not seem as
                        convinced as his staff of Israeli determination to acquire nuclear weapons.
                        He felt it inadvisable to press for more trips by Embassy staff to the
                        South. The <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> is already sensitive on this
                        issue and such trips could prejudice 1) the Dimona inspections, 2) [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] and
                        3) the position of one or more Embassy officers—Ben-Horin/Marom in reverse.
                        The Ambassador believed the Dimona inspections hung by <pb n="383" xml:id="pg_383" facs="0415"/>only a thread. Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> has found it increasingly difficult
                        politically to continue them, but realizes he has a firm commitment to the
                        U.S. The argument that Ben-Gurion also agreed to the inspections does not
                        solve the Prime Minister's problems since he has other fractious political
                        elements with which to deal.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Barbour</persName> said that cutting
                        down the duration of the last Dimona visit had not been Prime Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>'s doing. The Prime Minister
                        had ordered the facility to be cleared for inspection beginning Friday night
                        through Saturday night as late as necessary. The <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> was not monolithic and local officials did not always
                        respond readily to instructions. <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> was disturbed that the President might think he had
                        welched on his commitment.</p>
                    <p>In this connection, the Science Attache believed he had convincing evidence
                        that parts of the Dimona facility had been purposely moth-balled to mislead
                        the visiting team. He and other Embassy officers believe Israeli scientists
                        are preparing all necessary elements for production of a nuclear device,
                        leaving undone only last-minute assembly.<note n="2" xml:id="d178fn2">Airgram A–742 from Tel Aviv, April 9, discussed the status of the
                            Dimona reactor in more detail. It concluded that the Israelis “have now
                            created a flexible basis of choice regarding the possibility of
                            producing nuclear weapons. Although the technical facilities are in an
                            advanced state of preparation, we believe that weapons are not now being
                            made, and there is no evidence that the Israelis have made a decision to
                            move the rest of the way toward producing them.” (Ibid., AE 11–2

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Preemption Against Arab Water Diversion Works</p>
                    <p>Embassy officers reflected a widespread Israeli philosophy calling for
                        preemptive action to forestall Arab Jordan water diversion. Although the
                        technical community and some members of the Foreign Ministry discounted Arab
                        intentions to divert water, the <gloss target="#t_IDF1">IDF</gloss> and
                        Foreign Ministry “hard liners” played up the need for such action. The
                        public, of course, was sold on the idea. <gloss target="#t_IDF1">IDF</gloss>
                        officers had indicated they believed the U.S. had been given ample warnings
                        of Israeli intent to take preemptive action. A commonly expressed feeling
                        was that preemptive action would be desirable soon while U.A.R. troops were
                        still embroiled in Yemen.</p>
                    <p>The Consulate General at Jerusalem reported concern in Jordan that aggressive
                        Israeli pressures might result in hostilities. For the first time in their
                        experience, old time American residents had approached the Consulate
                        inquiring about plans for caring for American citizens in times of crisis.
                        Both the Consulate General and the Embassy were reviewing their E and E
                        plans.</p>
                    <p>In fact, there is at the present time little against which to take preemptive
                        action. Since November 1, 1964, only about 8 kilometers in Syrian territory
                        have been cleared as a right of way for a possible <pb n="384" xml:id="pg_384" facs="0416"/>canal. Rains had prevented rapid progress
                        on this work which was supervised by Yugoslav engineers and surveyors.
                        Preemptive action at the present time would be limited to destruction of up
                        to ten bulldozers.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Barbour</persName> did not believe
                        reference of the water issue to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> was
                        practical and the Israelis believed our suggestion to do so represented
                        backtracking on our undertaking to support the Unified Plan. It had become
                        necessary now to reaffirm this support openly. The verbiage attached to our
                        recent statements of support had caused Israeli officials to feel they were
                        “on the slippery slope.” </p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Israeli Rocket Developments</p>
                    <p>Israel's capability for rocket production has increased. The Israel Aircraft
                        Industries (Bedek) has built up its personnel considerably, beyond the needs
                        for a normal aircraft corporation. Research on rocket propulsion and
                        components is moving forward rapidly. Recent reports indicated Israel would
                        soon be capable of producing ten tons of liquid oxygen or more per day.
                        Other rocket production activities included operation of filament winding
                        machines, heliarc tube welding apparati, operation of a $750,000 computer.
                        Israel appeared to have decided to develop an indigenous capability in the
                        production of rocket propellants and small rockets but to acquire large
                        rockets abroad.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Israeli Counter Boycott</p>
                    <p>The Ministry of Commerce was not enthusiastic about the Israeli counter
                        boycott because the Israeli economy was doing well without it and its
                        imposition might create unforeseen problems. The Foreign Ministry, however,
                        appeared to favor the boycott and the word had gone out to the American
                        Jewish communities. Companies such as Union Carbide had already begun
                        calculating the pressures that could be placed on its business activities by
                        American Jews. Their preliminary conclusions were that they could not
                        withstand these pressures.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Barbour</persName>'s Thoughts on the Jordan Arms Quid pro Quo
                        Package</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Barbour</persName> believed that we may
                        have been well advised to append a large package of quid pro quo's to the
                        request for Israeli support on U.S. sales of arms to Jordan in return for
                        selected direct sales to Israel. He was disturbed, however, that the
                        Department thought it could obtain these desiderata. He believed their
                        inclusion may have been useful in shaking up the Israelis but now it might
                        be preferable to seek each objective separately. It was preferable to make a
                        “grand gesture” on direct arms sales since we considered it inevitable
                        anyway. Such an attitude would ensure greater Israeli receptivity to our
                        other demands.</p>

                        points in detail. <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> returned to
                        theme that from report of <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName>'s
                        last talk he had understood that certain changes were proposed and it was
                        left that these could be considered. <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName> then had come in with new restricted <pb n="386" xml:id="pg_386" facs="0418"/>proposal, which as we now knew Prime
                        Minister had found totally unacceptable. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> repeated rationale of new proposals: that since
                        Israel had been unable to accept broader arrangements, we had accordingly
                        moved to a position that what we did for Jordan we would do for Israel. This
                        meant that we would hold to same policy of restraint in arms sales as in
                        past 15 years, regarding these proposed new sales to Israel and Jordan as a
                        balanced exception to policy. We had made exception in Hawk sales. We had
                        moved to this position because rapid course of events in <gloss target="#t_NE1">NE</gloss>, which could place us in most difficult
                        position, had led us to conclude that necessary actions could not be further
                        delayed while Israel and US continued discussion of certain aspects of
                        original broader proposal.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> expressed inability to
                        understand why narrower proposal should have included same request for
                        Israeli assurances on questions of pre-emption and nuclear proliferation
                        that had been in broader proposal. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> noted these now framed in somewhat different fashion
                        and that no assurance was now asked for beyond what <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> had already said he was willing to
                        give. <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> complained that US seemed
                        to be prepared to give arms to Jordan without conditions, even though Jordan
                        involved in water diversion plans and in <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss>. <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>, however, still insisting
                        on full Israeli assurances its arms would not be used against Arabs.
                            <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> reviewed whole complex of
                        reasons making it in interest of Israel and West to meet request of Jordan
                        from non-bloc sources.</p>
                    <p>In repetitive second telephone call of March 5<note n="4" xml:id="d179fn4">No
                            record of this telephone conversation has been found.</note>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> requested additional
                        clarification points of issue. Repeatedly sought to get from <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> precise answers to question whether
                            <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> would oppose any alteration in
                        Johnston Plan, specifically any off-take by Lebanon beyond 35 MCMs.
                            <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> replied <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> could assure Prime Minister US
                        position same as expressed in January 1964 in Presidential letter carried by
                        Shriver and Departmental-Embassy discussions on details of Johnston Plan.
                        There had, of course, been some differences in Israeli and US interpretation
                        of Plan at that time. However, in its desire to help protect Israel's
                        interests, US has made clear that it would oppose Arab disruption of
                        Israel's water supply. If Ambassador wished to get into details of
                        interpretation of Johnston Plan again, we could do that on his return to
                        Washington. In meantime, we hoped he would convey reassurances to Prime
                        Minister.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> suggested <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> could also tell his Government we
                        unable to understand why Israel seemingly taking position that prospective
                        Sovietization of Jordan armed forces, with all significance that <pb n="387" xml:id="pg_387" facs="0419"/>would have for <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>'s efforts remain independent, would be more in
                        Israel's interest than our proposed line of action. <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> did not respond directly, but
                        returned to observation that new narrow proposal unacceptable to Israel.
                            <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> gave no indication we
                        proposed to return to broader proposal. He urged on Harman importance of
                        completing our current discussions promptly.</p>

                    <p>Eyes only for <persName>Bundy</persName> from <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName>. Herewith my current appraisal our negotiating
                        position.</p>
                    <p>1. Big problem is that it has probably lost good deal of its credibility in
                        Israeli eyes.</p>
                    <p>A. <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Barbour</persName>'s initial demarche telling
                        Israelis we had to go ahead pronto on Jordan arms was 4 February over month
                        ago. Since then we've repeatedly underlined urgency this matter. As
                        instructed I just told them again we must go ahead. But by this time,
                        Israelis must have concluded we unwilling actually do so without adequate
                        assurances at least tacit Israeli support.</p>
                    <p>B. Keeping <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> and then me here
                        so long further underscores our reluctance to move. Though Israelis also
                        realize I being kept here so they can't shift venue to Washington, even this
                        adds to their bargaining leverage.</p>
                    <p>C. Fact that each time we get new instructions we slightly enrich our offer
                        probably also convinces them that we prepared pay pretty high price if they
                        wait us out. Even latest proposal, though deliberately conditioned be
                        unacceptable, at least dangled possibility some 40–50 million dollars in
                        arms sales, which would buy quite a few tanks and planes.</p>
                    <p>D. Inevitable publicity attendant on <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> mission further eroded our bargaining position. I
                        should have come out again covertly, <pb n="388" xml:id="pg_388" facs="0420"/>but hesitated argue this too strongly a second time. Adding to publicity
                        is what I suspect is deliberate Israeli press campaign put pressure on us
                        sell arms to Israel. This too probably inevitable once speculation on
                            <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> mission mounted and
                        Israelis also found out we willing in principle.</p>
                    <p>2. Thus chief remaining credible element our position is that we keep
                        insisting Israel give us quite far-reaching reciprocal undertakings for what
                        they want from us. At bottom, Israelis have probably already accepted our
                        basic propositions insofar as they can. Biggest difficulty is how to get
                        these recorded in manner politically tolerable to Eshkol yet sufficiently
                        reassuring to us.</p>
                    <p>3. You may recall my prediction about six weeks of haggling needed get
                        Israelis signed on to Jordan arms sale. However, I was wrong in assuring
                        President that adding major concession of willingness make direct sales
                        Israel too at long last would permit quick agreement. Perhaps this was
                        possible if negotiation confined these two issues.</p>
                    <p>But several factors—trying reach broad package understanding, necessarily
                        high pressure tactics because of need go ahead with Jordan, some awkward
                        phrasing, our brief, and Israeli inability shake hands on a deal without
                        haggling, have stretched out bargaining process. Nor is this really
                        surprising, given crucial importance to both Israel and US of series of
                        matters we trying settle.</p>
                    <p>4. Next essential to be taken into account is that Israeli security position
                        is in fact deteriorating, even if there were no prospective US arms sales to
                        Jordan to add marginally to Arab threat. Crux of matter is continued Soviet
                        arms supply to Arabs, but secondary factors are new degree of Arab unity of
                        command under <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss>, and German arms
                        cancellation. Add to this Israeli nervousness over what they rightly see as
                        mounting new Arab-Israeli crisis over Jordan waters, which will test their
                        mettle and ours.</p>
                    <p>5. This is basic context in which Israelis (a) worry lest we tie their hands
                        on preemption; (b) fear we falling away on Johnston Plan, where US their
                        chief supporter; and (c) naturally seize on golden opportunity presented by
                        our coming to them on Jordan matter to milk us for all they can get.</p>
                    <p>6. Important to recognize, however, that our coming to them merely
                        precipitated these issues. They would have been at us shortly in any case
                        with new arms requests and appeals for support on water. Remember they asked
                        to send Golda Meir and military team for talks even before we hit them on
                        Jordan arms.</p>
                    <p>7. If above analysis correct (Barbour, an old hand by now at Israeli game,
                        believes it is), then we need reassess our negotiating position. Barbour
                        comments that we trying buy new Cadillac for ten bucks. If our real position
                        is that we unwilling go ahead on Jordan arms without <pb n="389" xml:id="pg_389" facs="0421"/>satisfactory assurance at least tacit
                        Israeli support, and if Israelis convinced of this by now and think they can
                        afford to outwait us, then have we any alternative but to pay the necessary
                        price?</p>
                    <p>8. Little doubt their basic demand is for credible fleshing out our carefully
                        hedged promise to sell arms. This probably will take light bombers as well
                        as tanks. Perhaps best means of sawing off matter promptly enough to enable
                        us move on Jordan sales, would be private oral commitment by me, on
                        President's behalf, that will provide certain number tanks and see that they
                        get certain number light bombers at decent price within specified period, if
                        they keep matter completely secret. Sanction would be, as on earlier tank
                        deal, that we'd cancel if matter came out. Reason for wording on bombers is
                        that we may prefer subsidize a Vautour/Spey engine deal.</p>
                    <p>9. Another way to restore credibility our position would be to take
                        calculated risk Israelis already sufficiently hooked, and go ahead with
                            <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> now. Odds are Israelis
                        would still keep reasonably quiet, while redoubling their pressures on us.
                        But need not spell out risks this course.</p>
                    <p>10. In sum, maintaining Israeli deterrent edge is so important to us as
                        stabilizing factor in new Arab-Israeli crisis, other commitments we seek are
                        so valuable, and it so important go ahead with Jordan that we ought either
                        (a) make final offer good enough to sign up Israel; or (b) soften up
                        Israelis by showing them they don't have veto on Jordan arms.</p>
                    <p>11. Believe I aware as anyone in Washington of importance preserving US
                        position in Arab world. Moreover, I fear we'll lose <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> if we don't sign contract before
                        Arabs conclude from all the publicity that we have to buy off Israelis
                        first. Indeed unless some secrecy preserved on Israeli arms, we may lose
                            <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> anyway, because <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> will accuse Hussein of forcing US
                        arms sale to Israel by his insistence on taking US instead of Soviet
                        arms.</p>
                    <p>12. But underlying reality is that developing situation in Middle East will
                        compel us to sell tanks and probably planes to Israel sooner or later
                        anyway, as only alternative to binding alliance. So it strikes me as much
                        better to promise this quietly now, when we can get maximum in return, than
                        to stall till public pressures plus area imperatives force us to do so later
                        with less return for US. Afraid my <gloss target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss>
                        colleagues fail grasp this fundamental.</p>
                    <p>13. Unless next Israeli counterproposal proves above analysis wrong, will
                        send gist shortly to Department. But want inform you in advance in hope you
                        can weigh in on these unpleasant realities; if relayed too bluntly from here
                        they may sound like self-seeking advice.</p>

                    <p>1. Have reviewed all your messages over this week end and have had long talks
                        with highest authority. I detect a difference in temper between our sense of
                        the problem and yours, which this message aims to bridge. Current clear
                        preference here is for a prompt and clear-cut understanding limited as
                        closely as possible to the immediate problem of Jordan arms sale. The
                        general line in Deptel 685<note n="2" xml:id="d181fn2">The reference should
                            be to telegram 865, <ref target="#d175">Document 175</ref>.</note> is
                        not a bargaining tactic but his genuine preference. </p>
                    <p>2. Highest authority does not now believe we should accept continuing general
                        open-ended obligation to supply arms to Israel. The carefully hedged offer
                        in <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName>'s initial instructions
                        was matched by a requirement of strong Israeli undertakings on nuclear
                        weapons and on avoidance of pre-emptive attack over Jordan waters. But
                        Israelis resist flat undertakings which affect their ultimate sovereign
                        power. (This Israeli reluctance has been reaffirmed forcibly through
                        Feinberg today—protect source.)</p>
                    <p>3. In this situation White House view is we should leave these larger wider
                        questions open for later discussion. We cannot now get a guarantee on the
                        nuclear matter or even on Jordan waters. We have requested State-Defense
                        coordination on concrete proposal which might meet <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>'s aside to you—taking account of your
                        own recommendations to us. In addition we would want a gentlemen's agreement
                        that our deal with <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> will not
                        be undercut by Israel, but we do not currently think that <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> letter to President is essential
                        means of registering this gentlemen's agreement.</p>
                    <p>This message is for guidance only and is not an instruction. Instruction
                        should follow today or tomorrow, and present object is simply to insure that
                        in any intervening discussion you focus attention sharply on the immediate
                        problem of Jordan decision and a balancing arms <pb n="391" xml:id="pg_391" facs="0423"/>offer to Israel. Highest authority wishes to take every
                        possible step to turn talks away from open-ended arms commitment now.<note n="3" xml:id="d181fn3">

                    <p>896. For <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName>.</p>
                    <p>1. Since Israelis have delayed several days in making counter proposal, you
                        should now approach <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> as soon as
                        possible and seek his prompt agreement on carefully defined and limited
                        agreement foreshadowed in <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss>
                            865.<note n="2" xml:id="d182fn2">

                    </p>
                    <p>2. Terms and conditions of proposal are as follows:</p>
                    <p>(1) The US recognizes Israeli tank needs have increased because of
                        prospective Jordan sale and possibility of non-delivery of 90 remaining
                        German tanks. Accordingly, the US is now prepared to ensure sale on
                        favorable credit terms of tanks to meet these changes as follows:</p>
                    <p>(a) 100 tanks for later delivery to match new Jordan sales, and</p>
                    <p>(b) 90 tanks for delivery in calendar year '66 if German agreement is not
                        completed.</p>
                    <p>We can make these deliveries in form of M–48A1 or M–48A3 tanks, but you
                        should point out that what we offer Israel we may have to offer Jordan.</p>
                    <pb n="392" xml:id="pg_392" facs="0424"/>
                    <p>(2) The <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> is prepared to ensure opportunity
                        for Israel to buy “a few” planes for later delivery, if not from Western
                        sources, then from the United States. The <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> does not believe it is in the interest of either government
                        to decide now on exact model of airplane. <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>. “A few” means less than 20, which is the upper limit of
                        possible sales under proposed Jordan agreement, and you should make this
                        number privately known to <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>. End
                            <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>(3) We wish to have a private agreement with Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> that Israel will not attack Jordan
                        arms sale and that friends of Israel in the US will be given clear private
                        guidance on this point. We ask this private agreement because we understand
                        from <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName> mission that Government of Israel
                        does plainly prefer US to <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> as Jordanian
                        arms supplier. You should re-emphasize our understanding of this point and
                        make it clear to <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> that if he
                        takes a different view, now and not later is the time to say so.</p>
                    <p>(4) US undertakings on tanks and aircraft for Israel, as stated above, must
                        be kept wholly secret for as long as possible in interest of both
                        governments, and there must be agreement to consult fully on means of
                        handling public statements when they become necessary.</p>
                    <p>3. You and Ambassador are authorized to develop argumentation for this
                        straightforward agreement in the light of your own understanding of thinking
                        of <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>. The following arguments seem
                        important to us:</p>
                    <p>(1) Unless Israelis will tell us that they prefer Soviet arms to Jordan, we
                        must move promptly with <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>. But
                        we greatly prefer not to make a deal with <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> unless we have an understanding with <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>, and therefore such understanding is
                        increasingly urgent unless Israelis wish to take responsibility for driving
                            <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> to the Soviets.</p>
                    <p>(2) The offer to find necessary tanks up to a total of 190 should more than
                        meet immediate Israeli concerns deriving from Jordan sale and possible
                        German shortfall.</p>
                    <p>(3) Similarly, offer to join in finding “a few” aircraft represents precisely
                        what <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> asked for in his aside to
                        you. First military analysis suggests that B–66 is not at all what Israelis
                        really want, in either political or military terms. It would outrage Cairo
                        but not offer best capabilities. There are a number of other planes, both US
                        and European, which deserve careful study before a decision is made. In this
                        situation it is much better not to decide on specific aircraft or means of
                        ensuring sale. We have taken full note both of <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>'s aside to you and of his statement that Israelis can
                        find the funds they need. We believe him on both counts. He in turn should
                        believe us when we say that we will help. This offer in fact goes beyond any
                        commitment we will now make to Jordan.</p>
                    <pb n="393" xml:id="pg_393" facs="0425"/>
                    <p>(4) You should make it absolutely clear that broader agreement initially
                        proposed by <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> now seems to us
                        wholly impracticable. Our offer to supply arms in the future was carefully
                        hedged and made contingent upon Israeli acceptance of undertakings on Jordan
                        waters and on nuclear development which are flatly unacceptable to the
                            <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>. We recognize and accept that it is
                        impossible for <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> to abandon final
                        sovereign right of decision. But what is true for Prime Minister is just as
                        true for the President. We therefore conclude that it is much better for
                        both governments to reach a clear agreement now on the issues which need
                        decision and to proceed as friends in the future, treating wider issues on
                        their merits. We both will be free to press our view on these wide issues,
                        always within the framework of recognition by both governments of their deep
                        common interest in preserving the peace both by limiting the arms race and
                        by avoiding a dangerous imbalance of power. <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>. If necessary to reach agreement, we could consider a
                        reaffirmation of US policy in this sense, just as we are ready to reaffirm
                        our policy on Jordan waters as stated in Shriver letter and our readiness to
                        press <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> for agreement to keep
                        tanks east of the river. End <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>4. You should make it very clear to <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> that if this generous solution to the immediate
                        problem is not acceptable, your mission will be at an end and it may become
                        necessary for <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> to make its own decision
                        on Jordan even without Israeli support. You should make it clear as your own
                        personal judgment that, without agreement, Washington would have to reach
                        and publicize its own judgment that Israelis themselves prefer US supply to
                        Jordan, as against Moscow. The US and Israel have now spent a month
                        exploring alternatives and we are not prepared to allow the Government of
                        Israel to bargain indefinitely in search of advantage from a US decision
                        which in and of itself already serves true Israeli interest.</p>
                    <p>5. Finally, you should make it very clear indeed that we are not ready to
                        accept a shift in the arena of discussion either by a special Israeli
                        emissary to Washington or by an attempted end-run through friends of Israel
                        in the United States. Such tactics are certain to react adversely to the
                        interests of Israel. We have now made this point clear on about five
                        occasions to friends of Israel in Washington and we are not pleased by
                        continuing efforts to use these side channels.</p>

                    <p>We planned deliver basic M–48 to Jordan and M–48A1 to Israel, Israel could

                        memorandum of understanding follows:</p>
                    <p>“I. The Government of the United States has reaffirmed its concern for the
                        maintenance of Israel's security and has renewed its assurance that the
                        United States firmly opposes aggression in the Near East and remains
                        committed to the independence and integrity of Israel.</p>
                    <p>II. The Government of Israel has reaffirmed that Israel will not be the first
                        to introduce nuclear weapons into the Arab-Israel area.</p>
                    <p>III. In view of the importance of an effective Israel deterrent capacity as a
                        major factor in preventing aggression in the area, the United States will of
                        course continue, as in the past, to be ready to discuss with Israel its
                        needs and problems.</p>
                    <p>IV. The United States has informed the Government of Israel that it may sell
                        quantities of arms and military equipment to Jordan in order to preclude the
                        Soviet supply of arms through the <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> to
                        Jordan. King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> has assured the
                        United States that if he purchases US tanks, he intends to keep his armor on
                        the East Bank of the Jordan. The United States also has made clear to King
                            <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> that if he purchases
                        Soviet arms there will be no sales from the United States. The United States
                        will keep Israel informed of the completion of any deal with Jordan for the
                        provision of US arms and equipment.</p>
                    <pb n="399" xml:id="pg_399" facs="0431"/>
                    <p>V. It is understood that Israel is not interested in buying some of the
                        particular items sold to Jordan. Instead the United States will sell Israel
                        on favorable credit terms, or otherwise help Israel procure, certain arms
                        and military equipment as follows:</p>
                    <p>A. The United States will ensure the sale directly to Israel at her request
                        of at least the same number and quality of tanks that it sells to
                        Jordan.</p>
                    <p>B. In the event of the Federal Government of Germany not supplying to Israel
                        the remainder of the 150 M48 tanks outstanding under the German-Israel tank
                        deal of 1964, the United States will ensure the completion of this
                        program.</p>
                    <p>C. The United States is further prepared to ensure an opportunity for Israel
                        to purchase a certain number of combat aircraft, if not from Western
                        sources, then from the United States.</p>
                    <p>VI. The Government of Israel intends to provide the Government of the United
                        States with a list of its requirements in the near future and requests that
                        discussions on this list take place in Washington at a mutually convenient
                        time.</p>
                    <p>VII. The Governments of the United States and Israel agree that full secrecy
                        shall be maintained on all matters referred to herein and all subsequent
                        actions taken in this connection, until the two governments agree on how and
                        when to divulge them. The Government of the United States has explained to
                        the Government of Israel that premature publicity on the matters covered
                        under this understanding could create serious complications for the United
                        States in its relations with other states in the area. The Government of
                        Israel has informed the Government of the United States that it understands
                        this concern and will be guided accordingly.”</p>

                        that was prerequisite to our completing Memorandum of Understanding with
                        King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>. Package includes
                        Israeli assurances against being first in area to go nuclear, Israeli
                        agreement to acquiesce in US arms sales to Jordan, renewed US assurances of
                        opposition to aggression in the area, and US agreement to sell Israel on
                        favorable credit terms military equipment in quantities and kinds comparable
                        to US sales to Jordan, plus “less than twenty-four” aircraft after 1966 if
                        Israel unable obtain them from Western European sources. US would also stand
                        ready to complete unfinished portion of German-Israeli tank deal of 1964.
                        End <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>You are authorized to present approved draft of Memorandum of Understanding
                            (<gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 516) to King, explaining
                        changes described <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 518. Although
                        you would expect King to find draft acceptable in view of earlier careful
                        negotiation of understanding, he should know that you instructed to refer to
                        Washington any changes that may be proposed. You have authority to sign
                        Memorandum of Understanding in present form.</p>
                    <p>If, as foreshadowed in your recent talk, King asks what are <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> intentions with respect to any military
                        sales or assistance to Israel, you should remind him that he and <persName corresp="#p_KGA2">Khammash</persName> had earlier told you and <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> that Jordan could live with US
                        military sales to Israel provided they not disproportionate. You should say
                        that during <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> mission and
                        since then <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has been making strong
                        efforts to restrain Israel through a most difficult period. <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> was successful to some degree in
                        reassuring Israelis as to continued US interest in their integrity and
                        security and US determination to use its influence for peaceful resolution
                        area problems. We believe that likelihood of a preemptive military strike by
                        Israel has been substantially reduced.</p>
                    <pb n="401" xml:id="pg_401" facs="0433"/>
                    <p>King knows well that US desires to give maximum support to <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>'s regime, yet traditional US policy
                        has been not to become a major supplier of armaments to either side of the
                        Arab-Israel dispute. This latter position has been part and parcel of our
                        policy of balance in the Arab-Israel context. This dilemma has been
                        difficult for us to resolve. While we have not considered the US has a right
                        to regulate the balance of arms in the Near East, we do have a legitimate
                        concern in preventing development of a significant military imbalance that
                        would be a major threat to peace because of overconfidence or desperation of
                        one side or another.</p>
                    <p>As we are prepared to make an exception to our policy in the case of Jordan,
                        we want the King to know that this may involve comparable sales to Israel.
                        Such sales would generally conform in quantity and type to what <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> is prepared to sell to Jordan.</p>
                    <p>We plan to inform certain other Arab governments of the purpose and substance
                        of the <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> talks in Israel and
                        of the possibility US may make limited arms sales to Israel. Our purpose
                        will be to allay concern and suspicion by explaining frankly reasons for
                        decision.</p>
                    <p>On aircraft, you may assure the King that we have encouraged Israel to look
                        to traditional sources of supply. In conformity with our position on
                        question of aircraft for Jordan, we would also tell Israel that if it is
                        unable to meet its requirement in Europe we would consider direct sale of a
                        few aircraft (about the same number as Jordan is asking). As King knows, we
                        have not discussed possible sale of F–104 series aircraft with Israel and do
                        not plan to do so. Unless Soviet bloc provides more and higher performance
                        aircraft to Arabs sufficient to change strategic situation, we will not
                        change our position during life of this agreement.</p>
                    <p>In the course of your negotiations you should make clear that Israel would
                        react sharply to positioning of Jordan armor on West Bank. Recalling
                        previous discussions of this problem with Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SPOA1">Solbert</persName>,
                        you should note our expectation that <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>'s asserted policy of not exposing his armor by
                        deployment on West Bank under normal peace-time conditions would be
                        continued.</p>
                    <p>We hope to minimize publicity on these arrangements. If the King should feel
                        need for domestic purposes to note purchases of new equipment, we would like
                        to coordinate approaches.</p>
                    <p>You should also note continuing US interest in Jordan's security as made
                        explicit by both President Kennedy and President Johnson.</p>

                    <p rend="center">The Problem</p>
                    <p>To estimate present attitudes and future trends in the Arab-Israeli problem
                        over the next two or three years.</p>
                    <p rend="center">Conclusions</p>
                    <p>A. The Arab-Israeli dispute is heating up. The initial success of Arab
                        efforts to cooperate in a scheme for diverting Jordan waters at Israel's
                        expense and for achieving a degree of military unity has given the Arabs
                        some confidence that they may be capable of hurting Israel. This Arab
                        cooperation and the new willingness of richer Arab states to contribute
                        funds to the program have led the Israelis to fear that a significant
                        turning point in the dispute is occurring to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s advantage. In response, they are hardening their
                        posture toward the Arabs. In this situation, tension will be higher in the
                        next few years and the danger of armed clashes greater.</p>
                    <p>B. In a year or so, if the Arab projects to divert the waters of the Jordan
                        River basin materialize, the danger of Israeli strikes to put them out of
                        commission will rise. However, we believe that Israel will first seek to
                        deter the Arabs by a combination of political and psychological moves,
                        directed particularly at detaching Jordan and Lebanon from effective
                        participation in a common Arab military and water diversion effort. The
                        chances are at least even that some development will come to pass by which
                        the Arab diversion projects would satisfy Arab self-esteem without
                        encroaching on Israel's minimum requirements for Jordan water. In the
                        absence of such developments, Israeli strikes against the diversion
                        projects, especially in Syria, are probable. An Israeli strike would
                        probably elicit some Arab military response, most likely by Syria, but would
                        severely strain Arab cooperation. There is some chance of more general
                        fighting in the tense circumstances <pb n="403" xml:id="pg_403" facs="0435"/>prevailing, but we believe that both sides would try to avoid a general
                        war during the period of this estimate.</p>
                    <p>C. The accelerating arms race is involving both the Arabs and Israel in
                        advanced weapons development, particularly in the missile field. The
                        Israelis probably will be able to deploy a French-built surface-to-surface
                        missile with a range of about 270 nautical miles by 1967–1968; the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> may be able to deploy considerably less
                        sophisticated missiles of slightly less range by 1968–1969. The <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> has virtually no prospect of acquiring
                        nuclear weapons except from foreign sources—which we consider highly
                        unlikely. By contrast, the Israelis could probably develop nuclear weapons
                        by 1968–1969 and/or nuclear warheads by about 1971 without outside
                        assistance, if a decision to go ahead were given at this time. We do not
                        believe, however, that the Israelis have taken such a decision.</p>
                    <p>D. Whether the Arab-Israeli controversy erupts into armed clashes or remains
                        confined to political tensions, it will almost certainly be more difficult
                        in the next few years for the US and other Western powers to maintain
                        satisfactory relations with both Israel and the Arab states. The dispute
                        will present the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> with opportunities to
                        increase its influence with the Arabs. Israel is likely to intensify its
                        already strong pressure on the US both to limit arms supplies to the Arabs
                        and to provide Israel with arms. Israel is also likely to press vigorously
                        for a US security guarantee. Given the strong Arab resentment over US
                        support for Israel in the past, developments of this sort might lead toward
                        a more pronounced polarization of the Arab-Israeli dispute to include the
                        Soviets and Arabs on one side, and Israel and the West on the other. In any
                        event, Nasser's strategy will include threats against Western interests in
                        the area in order to pressure the Western powers to lessen their support to
                        Israel.</p>

                    <p>Made careful presentation <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 521 to
                        which King's reaction milder than I had anticipated. On statement that we
                        considered likelihood of preemptive military strike substantially reduced,
                        he said he was glad to hear this but all of his intelligence contained
                        ominous indications of build-up for aggressive action. On statement that we
                        might have to make comparable sales to Israel, he said he quite recognized
                        that Israel could not be denied access to arms though he hoped that in
                        present mood of area we recognized that other Arabs might not react as
                        moderately as he did. On stationing of tanks on West Bank, he said he
                        obviously could not give assurances as to internal disposition of his
                        forces. However, he could assure me that under continuation of what might be
                        termed normal conditions he intended to keep tanks on East Bank, but
                        obviously under wartime conditions this assurance would not apply. He would
                        also continue make every effort avoid any action that might be considered
                        provocative.</p>
                    <p>On the memorandum of understanding, the King desired to add language along
                        lines of paragraph 3 of his letter to me (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 486)<note n="3" xml:id="d188fn3">
                            <ref target="#d154">Document 154</ref>.</note> but after some discussion
                        and in light of remarks I had already made, agreed to delete this provided I
                        would acknowledge receipt of his letter. This I agreed to do. He also sought
                        to insert language in illustrative sales list stipulating that second 100
                        tanks would be M48A3 but when I said this unacceptable to Washington he
                        agreed to remove language on understanding that DNF dealing with each other
                        in good faith and that he was anxious to move forward on this much of
                        package as soon as possible. He reiterated in this connection pressures he
                        felt from <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> to demonstrate concrete
                        results and fact that these results must ultimately in some form include
                        supersonic aircraft.</p>
                    <p>One open point in addition to changes covered below is that <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> acceptance of our delivery schedule on M48s
                        is still conditioned on <pb n="405" xml:id="pg_405" facs="0437"/>our ability

                    <p>Happily they concluded in agreement in writing and orally.</p>
                    <p>This was possible above all because of our confidence that we can always rely
                        on your understanding, goodwill and friendship. This knowledge is far more
                        important for me than words.</p>
                    <p>I know the heavy burden of responsibility that rests upon you as you strive
                        to preserve the peace and maintain freedom throughout the world, in a period
                        of great danger. My prayers and good wishes go out to you.</p>

                        finally got from the Israelis the essentials of what you wanted—their
                        agreement to sit still on Jordan arms in return for some tanks and planes.
                        State almost fouled us up again by rewriting the contract at the eleventh
                        hour, but we got over that hurdle too. My final cable (attached)<note n="2" xml:id="d190fn2">Telegram 1333 from Athens, March 11; attached but not

                        matter.</p>
                    <p>What really broke the logjam was our shifting (Mac tells me on your judgment)
                        from a broad package understanding, which was simply too much to negotiate
                        quickly, to a much more limited deal. Once we called their hand this way,
                        and were prepared to talk hardware, they tried <pb n="407" xml:id="pg_407" facs="0439"/>to shift back. However, <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> quickly settled when I told him first that we were
                        going ahead with Jordan and then showed him concretely just what we were
                        prepared to do for him.</p>
                    <p>On this last point, I was grateful that <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and <persName>Bundy</persName> accepted my
                        recommendation we talk 24 planes instead of 20. This bit of give will cost
                        us nothing in terms of any Arab reaction (24 is as bad as 20), yet it got us
                        past the point of making Israel so strictly comparable to Jordan that the
                        Israelis could cry foul. Nor will these necessarily have to be US
                        planes.</p>
                    <p>I also taped down that (a) we don't want to see any Israelis here for six to
                        eight weeks—this should buy us at least four; (b) attempted backdoor
                        negotiating with the White House through unofficial emissaries hurts more
                        than it helps; and (c) we will flatly oppose both premature jumping of the
                        Arabs over water and Israel going nuclear. As a bonus, we got a written
                        promise on the latter, for what promises are worth.</p>
                    <p>While I may be prejudiced (and also too tired to see the matter in the
                        round), I think we finally came out all right—and without giving more than
                        we'd have to give sooner or later anyway to our Israeli friends.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Israel:</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>I am glad that Bob Komer was able to work out arrangements with Israel
                        satisfactory to you. I was sorry to leave in the middle, but as there was so
                        much publicity about my presence, I felt it better to leave, particularly as
                        I gained such confidence in <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName>'s
                        skill in handling the negotiations. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Barbour</persName> also was most helpful.</p>
                    <p>My talks did some good in bringing <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> and his colleagues around to understanding the need
                        for our continuing military assistance <pb n="408" xml:id="pg_408" facs="0440"/>to Jordan. They also now clearly understand that we will
                        oppose their use of force under any circumstances in connection with the
                        Jordan water diversion. We must, however, make every effort to block Arab
                        diversion, if in fact it ever comes off.</p>
                    <p>The Israelis are very sensitive on the subject of their water rights, which I
                        know you will understand. We will have, I believe, continuing difficulty in
                        restraining them if peaceful means don't produce results. I therefore stated
                        bluntly that if the Israelis ever used force they would be up against United
                        States opposition. This was somewhat of a shock, but I am satisfied it was
                        useful.</p>
                    <p>The Israelis feel that the military balance with the Arabs has deteriorated
                        since <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>'s visit last June and
                        they want to discuss this subject again.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> asked me to convey to you his
                        strong hope that we would move our Embassy to Jerusalem. I explained the
                        difficulties but he persisted in his request. <gloss target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss> believes it would be most inadvisable to make such a move
                        at the present time. If you agree, I will write Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> informally that you feel this matter
                        should be deferred under the present circumstances.<note n="2" xml:id="d191fn2">No letter from <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>

                    <p>Dear Mr. President:</p>
                    <p>Since my message to you last December 12<note n="2" xml:id="d192fn2">See <ref target="#d117fn2">footnote 2, Document 117</ref>.</note> I have
                        looked forward to a further exchange of views between us. Now,
                        unfortunately, <pb n="409" xml:id="pg_409" facs="0441"/>new tensions have
                        developed in the Near East. I have been deeply concerned by developments in
                        the direct relations of the United States and the United Arab Republic which
                        have put strains on the friendship I hope for between our two governments
                        and peoples. As the proud leader of an important people, you will, I know,
                        share my view that the best way to deal with difficulties of this kind is to
                        discuss them man to man, with full respect for each other's rights and
                        responsibilities.</p>
                    <p>I have therefore asked Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BLD2">Battle</persName> to seek an appointment with you to bring this
                        personal message and to discuss with you the issues of current importance in
                        the Near East that concern us both.</p>
                    <p>The problem which needs this kind of discussion today is that of the best way
                        of dealing temperately and responsibly with the growing arms race in the
                        Middle East. As you know, the United States Government has consistently
                        sought to find ways and means of turning that arms race downward. We are
                        convinced that it does not serve the real interest of any people in the
                        area. At the same time, we have obligations and interests which require us
                        to take account of the pressures that are generated by very heavy arms
                        supply from other countries.</p>
                    <p>It is in this context that I have asked Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BLD2">Battle</persName> to discuss our present position with
                        you. That position has been established within the framework of our
                        traditional policy of restraint with regard to arms sales. The principles of
                        that policy are two:</p>
                    <p>First, we shall, to the greatest extent possible, continue to avoid selling
                        arms to the principal parties to the Arab-Israel dispute.</p>
                    <p>Second, in no case will we sell arms that will give one side a military
                        advantage over the other. This is the policy we have followed and will
                        continue to follow.</p>
                    <p>You and I carry heavy responsibilities. I am convinced that by serious
                        efforts on both sides, we can do much to improve understanding between our
                        Governments. I can assure you that on my side I will do my full part to
                        maintain and to increase relations of mutual respect between our two
                        countries. The interests of our peoples will thrive in strength and
                        understanding, not in weakness and frustration.</p>

                        limited and exceptional US arms sale to Israel in most acceptable light.
                        Recognizing <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> will be almost
                        bound suspect hidden US commitment to arm Israel and abandon “evenhanded”
                        policy, you should bear in mind following rationale:</p>
                    <p>(1) Sale to Israel would be an exception to our arms sales policy made to
                        prevent significant arms imbalance from posing a threat to peace resulting
                        from overconfidence or from desperation.</p>
                    <p>(2) Sale to Israel is limited commitment that we will strive to keep limited
                        and exceptional assuming Arabs show restraint.</p>
                    <p>(3) Sale is measure forced on us by complex of events including continued
                        heavy Soviet arms supplies to area; threatening posture of Unified Arab
                        Command and Arab spokesmen toward Israel, particularly in connection with
                        Jordan Waters; and Bonn's withdrawal as source arms supply for Israel.</p>
                    <p>Secondary purpose this approach is to invite resumption of dialogue with
                        Nasser, particularly on arms control but also on other matters of difference
                        between us. You should make sure this point is not lost.</p>
                    <p>Since we naturally wish avoid giving <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> a stick with which to beat Husayn, we don't want to
                        highlight Jordan arms sale as reason we are selling to Israel too.
                        Therefore, it mentioned only briefly in your talking points. If <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> raises Jordan matter, we wish you to
                        make clear distinction between US sales to Jordan and prospective sales to
                        Israel. Sales to Israel have different justification, in that their
                        rationale is to prevent significant imbalance in arms from posing threat to
                        peace from overconfidence or from desperation. While it is obviously
                        impossible prevent <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> from
                        assuming some linkage between US sales to Jordan and those to Israel, we
                        count on you to make distinction and avoid direct linkage between two.</p>

                    <p>Although we want over-all signal to be in nature of warning some US
                        assistance to Israel will occur, we do not want this to appear as threat or
                        ultimatum. Tone of presentation should be calm and reasonable without

                    <p>Following are talking points:</p>
                    <p>1. President has been increasingly concerned by strains that have developed
                        in relations of US and other Western states with Near East and particularly
                        by recent divergence of US and <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> policies.
                        Deterioration of Western relations with area has coincided with heightening
                        of tensions growing out of Arab-Israel dispute. Threat of hostilities over
                        Jordan Waters and activities of Unified Arab Command have brought to fore
                        continuing arms rivalry in Middle East. Resulting tensions have perhaps
                        inevitably increased doubts and suspicions about attitudes and policies of
                        outside states toward states of Near East. President has asked you to
                        discuss his concerns in detail, to clarify United States policies, and to
                        invite <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> to resume dialogue on
                        arms control and on various matters of difference between US and <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>2. As <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> must already know,
                        Israelis have been reacting strongly to spite aspects Arab water diversion
                        schemes, inflammatory and belligerent posture conveyed by Arab statements
                        and <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> arms buildup, and then German arms
                        cancellation. As part of continuing US effort to reduce tensions, President
                        sent <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName> to Israel to calm Israelis down and
                        talk out their worries. They discussed all aspects current Near Eastern
                        situation and reviewed US policies with Israeli leaders. They explained that
                        US opposition to aggression by any Near Eastern state against another
                        applied to Israel as much as to Arabs. They stressed to Israelis our
                        continued interest in peaceful resolution of area disputes.</p>
                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName> talks have eased situation, but basic
                        problems remain and are still a potential cause of war. Arabs appear
                        concerned lest Israel make military strike outside its borders. But Israel
                        in turn is disturbed by statements some Arab leaders they intend some day
                        wipe out Israel. For our part, we are concerned by Israeli arguments that
                        they might have to act to prevent continued influx of Soviet arms from
                        eventually giving Arabs upper hand. Israelis have convincing case because of
                        continued <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> buildup and stated Arab
                        intentions on water diversion. Because of such pressures we also fear
                        Israelis may someday feel forced shift from peaceful nuclear program to
                        weaponry.</p>
                    <p>4. US effort has been to try insure Israeli restraint by (a) counselling
                        peaceful solution to water issue; (b) reassuring Israelis on our opposition
                        to aggression and use of force; and (c) warning them against any acts of
                        desperation. To achieve those objectives, and to preserve atmosphere in
                        which peaceful solutions possible, we reassured Israelis that to extent we
                        agreed on existence of dangerous imbalance that <pb n="412" xml:id="pg_412" facs="0444"/>cannot be corrected by arms from other sources, <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> would make a direct but limited sale of
                        arms as an exception to existing policy.</p>
                    <p>5. We want <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> to see this in
                        perspective. As he knows, we have been most reluctant to become direct
                        supplier military equipment to any of principal parties to Arab-Israel
                        dispute. We know each side has been able to obtain weaponry from other
                        sources, and we are well aware each side considers itself best judge of what
                        is required defend itself as sovereign state. In our relations with both
                        Israel and Arabs we have taken all possible steps to arrest self-defeating
                        military rivalry and resultant waste of funds needed for improving peoples'
                        welfare. But our restraint has not been matched by the Soviet Union. While
                        making massive supplies of arms to states in area, it has pretended it is
                        working for peace while using Arab-Israel dispute to foment discord in its
                        interest.</p>
                    <p>6. We regard arms rivalry as self-defeating since each side ultimately can
                        match armaments obtained by other, but always at risk provoking preemptive
                        attack and at regrettable cost to progress and economic development. Thus
                        there is danger that one side will get military advantage substantial enough
                        to tempt it to launch preemptive attack—particularly if that advantage
                        appears to be declining. Key to shaky peace in Near East therefore may lie
                        only in preventing imbalances in categories of arms that might lead to
                        preemptive strike. This does not mean outsiders have right to regulate
                        armaments in absence of agreement among states concerned, tacitly or
                        otherwise. It means only that it may be in international interest to accede
                        to some arms requests in order to prevent conflicts.</p>
                    <p>7. Thus, if two sides are unwilling find peaceful accommodation or to arrange
                        some kind of attenuation in arms race, international community has no
                        alternative to selling arms to correct imbalances and thereby to preserve
                        peace. In observance this principle, <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                        sold Hawks to alleviate Israeli apprehensions of <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> bombers. For same reason <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> now would be prepared to sell Israel limited types and
                        quantities of arms required for their defense if assured of Israeli
                        restraint. This exception has not been lightly made. It has been made clear
                        to Israel Government, as President has asked you to make clear to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, that just as we have not lightly
                        made this exception in past we do not intend to do so in future.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>: If <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> asks about specific US commitments, you may say: US
                        has made no sales agreements with Israel but has agreed consider limited
                        Israeli requests. If he asks about tanks, you may say: Limited number of
                        older model US tanks are probably on horizon for obvious reasons. If he asks
                        about supersonic aircraft, you may say: <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                        does not contemplate selling Israel supersonic aircraft in F–104 category.
                        If he asks about less sophisticated aircraft, you may say: We continue <pb n="413" xml:id="pg_413" facs="0445"/>prefer Israel use European
                        suppliers unless significant imbalance develops in area. If Nasser asks
                        about other weapons, you may say: No arrangements for any other equipment on
                        horizon as yet. If he asks about price, you may say: US arms supplies will
                        be sales at same price to all buyers. End <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>8. US need to sell arms to Israel of course will be governed by what Arabs
                        do. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> should realize that if
                        Arabs challenge US on any limited arms sales to Israel, they might provoke
                        US public reaction that would jeopardize <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>'s restrained and evenhanded approach to Arab-Israel problem.
                            <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has always resisted going as far as
                        Israel keeps pressing it to go. Should Arabs force a showdown, they would
                        undercut US incentive to limit arms sales to Israel and force very
                        polarization of Near East situation <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                        seeks to avoid. Arab restraint toward their own arms acquisitions and toward
                        Israeli acquisitions from Western powers would facilitate Western efforts to
                        exert similar restraint. Thus we want to assure <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> that impartiality and restraint remain basis of US
                        arms policy. Any US sales of weapons to Arab states or Israel will be
                        minimum dictated by circumstances.</p>
                    <p>9. In this connection, President wants Nasser also to know we have agreed to
                        sell certain arms to Jordan. We considered Jordan request carefully over
                        period of several months. Although Arabs may not appreciate danger,
                        alternative of Soviet arms in Jordan would mean Soviet presence and
                        influence in unstable area from which they previously excluded. Resultant
                        dangers to stability of entire Near East would threaten Arab as well as US
                        interests. US therefore decided it would sell arms to Jordan to prevent
                        Soviet exploitation of situation.</p>
                    <p>10. <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> holds firmly to other tenets of its
                        Arab/Israeli policy beneficial to both sides. <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> will keep up pressure on Israel not to go nuclear. As
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> undoubtedly aware fact of
                        recent American visit to Dimona has been revealed by US press.<note n="3" xml:id="d193fn3">An article by John W. Finney, entitled “Israel Permits

                            Eastern Embassies in circular telegram 1692, March 14. (Ibid., AE 11–2
                            ISR) Telegram 922 to Tel Aviv, March 11, states that Finney was working
                            on a story, beginning from a lead given by Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> in a “Meet the Press” television
                            interview. (Ibid.)</note>
                        <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> also determined to oppose aggression
                        from any quarter and to continue effort to reduce risk of war. These are
                        more important, in our view, than limited arms sales.</p>
                    <p>11. Indeed, given special relationship we have had with <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, we hope our two governments may still find
                        a way to reverse Near East arms spiral. We have been gratified by
                        indications UAR leaders share our conviction that Arab-Israel dispute is
                        insoluble by force of arms. In face of world opinion and US commitment to
                        oppose aggression, neither side will ever achieve military capability to
                        impose solution on <pb n="414" xml:id="pg_414" facs="0446"/>other.
                        Consequently, best hope of reducing arms drain is for Arabs to renounce
                        development of certain categories of weapons in return for similar
                        renunciation by Israel.</p>
                    <p>12. We should also work together to find some way of avoiding a Jordan Waters
                        crisis. Most immediate threat to peace is prospective Lebanese action to
                        begin to divert Jordan tributaries to Syria. Most critical element in this
                        project is its representation by Arabs as device to deny water to Israel. We
                        believe tension could be relieved and magnitude of Israeli counteraction
                        reduced if Arabs would present their projects in more positive light,
                        indicating that purpose is to guarantee Arab users' access to water to which
                        they entitled on basis internationally accepted riparian laws and usages. As
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> knows, <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> believes Johnston allocations meet these
                        criteria. We recognize neither Arabs nor Israel refer to Johnston Plan
                        publicly, but we wonder if some other formula could be devised that would
                        encourage both sides to stay within their legitimate allocations.</p>
                    <p>13. We welcome ideas of <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> and
                            <gloss target="#t_UARG1">UARG</gloss> as to how Arab-Israel situation
                        may be defused; we are ready to cooperate in any way we can in mutual

                        will be considered in same spirit in which offered. We are seeking to reason

                    <p>1750. <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>: Developments in Near East since
                        mid-1963 have caused significant strains in relations of US and other
                        Western states with area. As of early 1965 <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> is perforce reexamining its relationship with <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. Prospect of military conflict over Jordan
                        Waters looms larger. Renewal of Saudi-Egyptian confrontation in Yemen looms
                        with possible reinvolvement of US. Arab nationalist drift toward Communist
                        Bloc poses danger that, led by economically distressed <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, Arab states could move toward closer
                        relationship with Soviets than at any time in last ten years. Recent West
                        German difficulties with Arab nationalists have accentuated deterioration of
                        Western relations with Near East. While Israel's loss of German arms source
                        created new pressures in US, exceptions in US arms sales policy forced by
                        Jordan arms request also faced us with probable serious repercussions from
                        Israel and from domestic reaction. In last few weeks doubts and suspicions
                        about US attitudes and policies have been voiced by Arab leaders throughout
                        area.</p>
                    <p>Some of deterioration in Western position is obviously beyond capability of
                        USG to control or influence. On other hand, frank discussions US views and
                        policies with host governments are needed to dispel some of doubts and
                        suspicions that have arisen. This particularly true so far as moderate Arab
                        leaders are concerned.</p>
                    <p>Moderate Arab leaders are important asset to US. Although it would be mistake
                        to try to use them as counterweights to Arab radicals, they may be able
                        quietly and behind scenes to restrain extremists. We envisage unity spirit
                        of Arabs as having certain built-in restraint. For sake of preserving unity
                        spirit, radicals will be constrained to avoid moving counter to moderate
                        sentiments, so long as moderates avoid forcing issue.</p>
                    <p>Purpose of following presentation is to clarify US views on various aspects
                        current situation—to avoid misunderstandings with radicals and to dispel
                        doubts and suspicions of moderates. End <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>.</p>

                    <p>You should seek early appointment at highest appropriate level stressing our
                        hope confidential nature discussion will be respected to make following
                        presentation which may also be used with other key officials of host
                        government at your discretion:</p>
                    <p>1) President has been concerned by recent signs of deterioration in Arab
                        relations with West. Tensions growing out of Arab-Israel dispute in
                        particular have accentuated strains between West and Arabs. Doubts and
                        suspicions have been expressed about attitude and policies of outside states
                        toward states of Near East. You have been instructed to review situation in
                        order to dispel any confusion about US policies and to promote better
                        understanding of our views.</p>
                    <p>2) For many years US has sought to help find way to just and honorable peace
                        in Near East. We are frank admit we see no prospect immediate solution to
                        Arab-Israel problem. On the other hand, we believe most leaders privately
                        agree with us that Arab-Israel dispute will not be solved by force of arms.
                        Yet positions taken on Jordan Waters problem have caused widespread concern
                        in international community.</p>
                    <p>3) Initial tone of moderation in First Arab Summit Conference in January 1964
                        encouraged us to think there would be peaceful and positive approach to
                        Jordan Waters problem. But more recently it has seemed to us that
                        constructive spirit of January 1964 has been forgotten. Arab spokesmen have
                        described Arab water projects in terms of spite diversion designed to take
                        water from Israel rather than to provide water for Arab peoples.
                        Inflammatory statements have been made by both sides in connection with
                        serious border incidents. Unified Arab Command has pressed individual Arab
                        states to increase their armaments, thereby adding new pressures to existing
                        arms rivalry. Arab statements of intent to liquidate Israel have tended give
                            <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> belligerent and threatening
                        posture.</p>
                    <p>4) US has been particularly concerned by worsened relations between West
                        Germany and Arab states and is hopeful that moderate views will prevail so
                        that productive German-Arab relations can be restored. We have noticed drift
                        among some Arab states that has seemed to us solely to serve interests of
                        Communists and has called into question policy of nonalignment. Some of
                        policy confrontations with West, including Congo, Cyprus, and South Arabia,
                        are difficult for us to understand if Arab states concerned desire mutually
                        beneficial relationships. These repeated confrontations have forced <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> to reexamine its relations with some Arab
                        states. US continues to desire mutually beneficial relationship with all
                        Arab states, but this is two-way street. As demonstrated by our reaction
                        certain recent events, we do not intend to take any policy actions out of
                        anger or indignation. On other hand, it is increasingly difficult for us to
                        maintain close relations in atmosphere created by some states during past
                        few months.</p>
                    <pb n="417" xml:id="pg_417" facs="0449"/>
                    <p>5) Jordan Waters problem and continuing arms rivalry cause particular concern
                        because of prospect of conflict Israelis quite aroused. So as part of
                        continuing US effort to reduce tensions in Near East, President recently
                        sent Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> to Israel.
                        While there <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> discussed all
                        aspects of current Near Eastern situation with Israel's leaders and reviewed
                        US policies with them. He assured Israel Govt of continued <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> interest in peaceful resolution of area
                        disputes. He reaffirmed our position with regard to Unified or Johnston Plan
                        as equitable standard by which to measure use of Jordan Waters. But he
                        emphasized that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> opposition to aggression
                        and use of military force to solve disputes applies to Israel as well as to
                        Arabs. He stressed our belief that peaceful solutions to area problems must
                        and can be found. In our view <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName>'s talks have helped to ease situation.</p>
                    <p>6) On other hand, basic Arab-Israel hostility remains. Arms rivalry poses
                        constant threat of conflict. Danger is that one side will get military
                        advantage tempting it to launch preemptive attack, or other side seeing
                        disadvantage may attack out of desperation. We ourselves for years have
                        followed policy of not supplying arms to parties directly engaged in
                        Arab-Israel dispute except for limited sales of defensive weapons. We have
                        repeatedly declared our intention to prevent or stop aggression by either
                        side. We have never argued we have right to regulate military balance. But
                        recognizing weapons sales sources available to both sides—and particularly
                        irresponsible way in which Soviets have sought to buy Arab friendship by
                        weapons sales—we know our restraint is not enough. Thus, we consider we have
                        legitimate interest in preventing imbalances in military hardware from
                        posing threat to peace by leading to preemptive strikes.</p>
                    <p>7) In this connection, you wish to point out that we have recently agreed to
                        sell certain arms to Jordan. We had considered Jordan request carefully over
                        period of several months. Request had been made under sponsorship of Unified
                        Arab Command, and it posed alternative of Soviet arms in Jordan if US did
                        not agree to sales. Although some Arabs may not appreciate danger,
                        alternative of Soviet arms in Jordan would mean Soviet presence and
                        influence in unstable area from which they previously excluded. Resultant
                        dangers to stability of entire Near East would threaten Arab as well as US
                        interests. US therefore decided it would sell arms to Jordan to prevent
                        Soviet exploitation of situation. <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>: Since
                        we naturally wish avoid giving <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
                        or other radical Arab leaders a stick with which to beat <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>, we do not want to highlight Jordan
                        arms sale as one of reasons for selling to Israel. If connection is raised,
                        you should make clear distinction between US sales to Jordan and prospective
                        sales to Israel. Sales to Jordan were made to prevent Soviets from entering
                        Jordan. Sales to Israel were made under following rationale: (a) Sale to
                        Israel would be an exception to our arms sales policy made to prevent
                        significant arms imbalance from posing a threat <pb n="418" xml:id="pg_418" facs="0450"/>to peace resulting from overconfidence or from desperation;
                        (b) Sale to Israel is limited commitment that we will strive to keep limited
                        and exceptional assuming Arabs show restraint; and (c) Sale is measure
                        forced on us by complex of events including continued heavy Soviet arms
                        supplies to area; threatening posture of Unified Arab Command and Arab
                        spokesmen toward Israel, particularly in connection with Jordan Waters; and,
                        last but not least, Bonn's withdrawal as source arms supply for Israel. End
                            <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>8) Insofar as possible US intends to continue its policy of restraint in arms
                        sales to principal parties to Arab-Israel dispute. We do not intend to try
                        to buy friends by irresponsibly selling weapons of destruction. At same
                        time, we cannot overlook serious imbalances that would threaten peace.
                        Nasser's action forcing Germans to cancel arms sales to Israel put heat
                        directly on us. We have told Israelis and also are informing Arabs that in
                        such exceptional cases we would sell Israel limited types and quantities of
                        arms required for their self-defense. However, we intend resist Israeli
                        efforts purchase more than their minimum defensive needs. We have not
                        lightly made such exceptions to our arms sales policy in past and would not
                        make them lightly in future. It really up to people like <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> and Syrians to decide by their own
                        actions how much we forced sell to Israel.</p>
                    <p>9) Moreover, Arabs should try to see in perspective that limited US sales to
                        meet Israel's basic security needs essential element US efforts restrain
                        Israel from dangerous military action. So US hopes there will be no public
                        campaign or Arab attempt force showdown. Result could be adverse US public
                        reaction jeopardizing our policy of restraint and evenhandedness.</p>
                    <p>10) US desires constructive and productive relationships with all Arab
                        countries. We wish to make certain our views are understood at all times and
                        will welcome continued policy consultations on matters of mutual
                        interest.</p>

                    <p>Dear Mr. Prime Minister:</p>
                    <p>I want to thank you for your thoughtful letter of March 12. I followed very
                        closely your discussions with Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName>, and I think your own summary is just right. And I
                        agree with you entirely that our confidence in each other's understanding,
                        goodwill, and friendship is more important than words—though words are
                        important, too.</p>
                    <p>I also understand fully the responsibility which you carry for the safety of
                        your land and people, and it helps me to have your generous recognition of
                        the responsibilities that fall to me. I believe that in the future, as in
                        the past, it will be possible for our two Governments to meet their

                    <p>4902. Paris for Ambassador. You should convey following oral message to
                            <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> from Secretary:</p>
                    <p>I understand that during your recent visit to Washington you mentioned
                        Israel's Dimona reactor to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>.
                        In this connection, you may have seen the article in the March 14 issue of
                        the <hi rend="italic">NYTimes</hi> on nuclear developments in Israel. The
                        article is generally accurate with the important exception, however, that
                        visits by American scientists to Israel's facilities have been at the
                        invitation of the Government of Israel and were not in the nature of
                        inspections.</p>
                    <p>The visits to Dimona were part of regular exchanges of visits by scientific
                        experts in connection with both U.S. installations and those of Israel. Our
                        experts have seen enough to draw what appears to be a reasonable conclusion
                        that the Dimona reactor is not being used to produce materials for nuclear
                        weapons. Nevertheless, they also concluded that, should the Israeli
                        Government decide to produce such materials and weapons from them, there is
                        an increasing Israeli capability to do so.</p>
                    <p>Under these circumstances, the United States believes it is highly desirable
                        that Israel accept <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards on all
                        of its facilities. Since the U.A.R. has no nuclear weapons capability for
                        the foreseeable future, we think Israeli acceptance of <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards might induce President
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> to accept similar
                        controls. Extension of <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards to
                        all nuclear facilities in the Near East would be a major step toward abating
                        the area arms race.</p>
                    <p>The United States continues to follow this situation with concern and would
                        hope for close consultations between our two governments regarding any
                        evidence of the introduction of nuclear weapons into that area.<note n="2" xml:id="d196fn2">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BCE2">Bohlen</persName> reported in telegram 5448 from Paris, March 26,
                            that he had that day conveyed the oral message to Foreign Minister Couve
                            de Murville, who expressed doubt that Israel would accept the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards. He said that although
                            according to French information, there was no evidence of any attempt by
                            Israel to produce materials for nuclear weapons, he thought Israel would
                            prefer to keep that possibility open. (Ibid.)</note>

                        replied that he was pleased with the response of the people. He had had a
                        brief rest out of town with the Vice Presidents who, under his instruction,
                        had not been allowed to talk business. He remarked that the campaign had
                        been unfortunate in one respect and that was that three people had been
                        killed during a demonstration of support which had caused him great
                        sadness.</p>
                    <p>I then told the President that I was delighted to have a talk with him. I
                        wanted to emphasize the great importance I attached and my govt attached to
                        our continued conversations. I said that we were in a difficult period and
                        that it was essential that we maintain regular, close and frank contacts
                        with each other. He agreed. He then said that he had received the message I
                        had sent him via Dr. Hatem (he obviously meant Sami Sharaf) which had
                        reached him just as he was preparing his speech for Assiut<note n="4" xml:id="d197fn4">The message has not been further identified. The speech

                            contained no direct attack on the United States and that the

                            declared the intention of recognizing Israel. (National Archives and

                        that what I had told him had been very helpful and had been contrary to
                        every other bit of info that he had. He also expressed his appreciation for
                        my having kept him informed of my movements and intentions with respect to
                        briefing him on the <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> mission.
                        He so strongly implied that if he had not received my message his speech
                        might have been different that I said again that we must not, either of us,
                        permit ourselves to act on any matter unless we were sure that we had talked
                        it out together and had the best info available. He nodded pleasantly and
                        agreed.</p>
                    <p>I then said that I was happy to present to him a letter from the

                            <ref target="#d192">Document 192</ref>.</note> He appeared pleased. He
                        opened it and read it twice with <pb n="422" xml:id="pg_422" facs="0454"/>great care. I had a slight feeling he was about to react to the contents
                        of the letter and I stopped him from commenting, saying that as the
                        President had requested I was there to brief him in detail on a great many
                        matters of some complexity. I said that again in the interest of being sure
                        that we had no misunderstanding I had written down the points that my govt
                        had instructed me to make and would follow closely an outline and suggested
                        that we have a frank talk thereafter. I then carefully went over the points
                        contained in <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 5632<note n="6" xml:id="d197fn6">
                            <ref target="#d193">Document 193</ref>.</note> which I had paraphrased
                        on paper (with a very few minor changes where I felt he might be offended or
                        confused by one or another word). I went very slowly, watching him closely
                        as I proceeded. He stopped me once or twice and I repeated phrases.</p>
                    <p>He then said “This gives me a good opportunity to talk about a number of
                        things.” I said I was glad to hear him say that. He again seemed on the
                        verge of an emotional response but quickly got himself under control. He
                        spoke strongly about the tanks that Germany had sold to Israel. He said that
                        the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> had known for some time that
                        military equipment was being sent to Israel but that the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> had believed it was entirely of German
                        manufacture. He said that the info about the tank deal had reached him two
                        or three months ago and had really caused “all the trouble.”</p>
                    <p>He said it led to the Ulbricht visit which had been pressed upon him for
                        three years. He said with great feeling there was no Soviet pressure at any
                        time contrary to what newspaper reporters in the US had indicated. East
                        Germany had never been mentioned by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> except insofar as the German problem itself was
                        discussed. He repeated emphatically there was no Soviet pressure and
                        appeared to irritate himself at the thought.</p>
                    <p>He then launched into various statements with respect to the numbers of tanks
                        going to Jordan. He said this would lead to more tanks going to Israel which
                        would lead to more tanks needed here. I attempted to get him off the
                        question of numbers and the inter-relationship of the Jordan-Israel-<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> problem by saying that the Jordanian and
                        the Israeli deals were for different reasons and that I did not have info on
                        the Jordanian matter which was somewhat separate from the general problem we
                        were discussing and that I assumed that through the <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> he would know the details of the Jordanian armament. He
                        then said (and came back to this point a couple of times) that he did not
                        know how many tanks the Germans had sold or delivered to Israel. Estimates
                        ranged from 60 to 300 or even more. He said “I suppose you are now going to
                        match all the tanks they haven't delivered. We don't know <pb n="423" xml:id="pg_423" facs="0455"/>how many were promised or delivered
                        although our military consider that 80 percent have been received.”</p>
                    <p>I replied that no sales contracts had been entered into but that the present
                        possibility was for a limited number of older models although that this was
                        not yet a firm deal. He then sought other details and I made the statement
                        contained in my instructions with respect to supersonic aircraft, less
                        sophisticated aircraft and to the absence of other weapons on the horizon. I
                        stressed the fact that the supplies we made available would be sales and at
                        the same price to all buyers. This seemed to relieve him.</p>
                    <p>The President then made some general comments. He said that the US “counted
                        all the Arabs together.” He said “The Arab world cannot be brought together
                        quickly or easily. You must realize this from your own experience with
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.” He said that what really had to
                        be considered was Egypt. Egypt would be the country which must be knocked
                        out in the event of a conflict. He said that no one could count upon the
                        other Arabs, either individually or collectively and that Egypt was the
                        mainstay as far as military power in the Arab world was concerned.</p>
                    <p>He then reviewed the events of 1956 and the precarious position the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> was in at that time drawing the moral that
                        the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> must always be able to defend itself
                        against aggressors. If the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> had not been
                        able to hold out for nine days if would have made no difference what the
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> or anyone else did. We talked for a
                        few minutes of that period and I reminded him rather delicately, I thought,
                        of the US role in 1956. He said that the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                        was appreciative of that role but repeated again that it had to be able to
                        withstand attacks. At that point I reaffirmed our desire now as in '56 for
                        peace in the area and of our readiness to do what we could to assure it.</p>
                    <p>By this time the President became quite reminiscent and reviewed the efforts
                        of the past to solve the Israeli problem. The statement by Ben Gurion re
                        earlier US efforts which recently appeared in the press seemed very much on
                        his mind. He expressed some concern that this statement would hurt him in
                        Egypt and the Arab world because it implied the possibility that he was
                        willing to come to terms on the Israeli problem. He indicated that he had
                        been willing during the Anderson Mission<note n="7" xml:id="d197fn7"> Robert

                        had been turned down by the Israelis. He said that he considered the
                        Israelis a threat to him and that the Arab world was concerned about
                        increase of population and immigration into Israel which would increase the
                            <pb n="424" xml:id="pg_424" facs="0456"/>threat. He said that earlier
                        proposals which he had been willing to go along with at one time would
                        perhaps have solved the problem but “you would have had something other than
                        Israel as it is today.” In effect the plans amounted to a new kind of state
                        based on Jews and the Arab refugees living together. Now he saw no solution
                        to the Israeli problem for years—50 or 60, maybe more.</p>
                    <p>During his comments he spoke of the Jordan waters; of the difficulty of
                        getting agreement in the Arab world to a plan; of the minimal effect that
                        the diversion plans would have on the actual supply of water available to
                        Israel; and of the relation to immigration of additional water supplies that
                        Israel might have. I repeated the arguments in my instruction with respect
                        to “spite” aspects of the Arab plan which I said was a source of tension and
                        that I thought we must all look to every source of strain and tension in
                        this delicate situation and try to remove them. He nodded but made no
                        comment.</p>
                    <p>At about this time an air raid warning went off and we sat silently for a few
                        minutes. I wondered what the realities of the Middle East had for us now. He
                        then assured me this was only a practice and a local one. We immediately
                        returned to the arms tension. He said “You have told me you are going to
                        sell arms to Israel. The pressure from my military will be to equal its
                        arms. The pressure from my military resulting from the German deliveries,
                        even though the amount is uncertain, has already been forthcoming.” I said
                        this was the point I had been making with respect to the need for some
                        curtailment of the unfortunate arms race in the Middle East. This is the
                        thing we must work toward. He made no comment and did not pursue the
                        matter.</p>
                    <p>As I started to leave I repeated the need for our govts to keep in close
                        touch. I said that we were in difficult period and that we must not permit
                        ourselves on either side to risk grave dangers because of misunderstanding
                        or misinformation and that I hoped that he would talk with me again after
                        thinking over what I had said. He asked me if I would give him a copy of the
                        notes from which I had worked or alternatively to send him a memorandum. I
                        said that the notes were informal with my pencil scribblings but that I
                        would leave them—which I did. (Included paraphrase paras 1–14, not <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss> paras, of <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 5632.) I said that after he had studied them perhaps a
                        further talk would be in order. I said that all times if he felt uncertainty
                        as to our intention or purpose or even curiosity as to what was going on I
                        would welcome a call from him or one of his staff. I also said that if he
                        had questions I could not answer I would say so and would attempt to get him
                        my govt's view in any situation by special emissaries here if he had any
                        feeling that this would be useful. I said that the President stood ready to
                        assure that he knew the details of <pb n="425" xml:id="pg_425" facs="0457"/>our positions and would provide an emissary if he wished to go into depth
                        on any issues. He said no, “I would prefer to continue as we are going.” He
                        expressed approval of the President's desire that talks continue and said
                        that he would be happy to see me at any time I felt it desirable.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: The conversation, except for the one or two
                        almost emotional moments, could not have been more cordial. His tone was
                        friendly, warm, and more in sorrow than in anger (after he learned of our
                        intentions). The only real emotion came with respect to the tank sale by the
                        Germans.</p>
                    <p>Neither the Yemen nor any of the other contingency subjects were raised and I
                        made no effort to bring them up as I felt we had both had enough.</p>

                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> has requested <gloss target="#t_CCC1">CCC</gloss> credit terms for 200,000 tons of corn (about $10 million

                        commercial terms, and is not regarded as “aid.”</p>
                    <p>Even so, we'd be chary were it not that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> reacted very mildly when we told him about limited US

                            Organization</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>Recent press accounts indicate that the Palestine Liberation Organization
                            (<gloss target="#t_PLO1">PLO</gloss>) plans shortly to have offices in
                        all Arab countries except Saudi Arabia. Offices are also to be opened in
                        Great Britain, India, Indonesia and the United States. An office has been
                        opened in Pakistan. As officers in these countries will probably be exposed
                        increasingly to contacts with the <gloss target="#t_PLO1">PLO</gloss> and
                        its officials, the Department wishes to set forth guidelines for these
                        contacts.</p>
                    <p>There are of course fundamental differences between the <gloss target="#t_PLO1">PLO</gloss>'s views of the Palestine problem and our
                        own. We are as a matter of national <pb n="427" xml:id="pg_427" facs="0459"/>policy committed to support the continued existence of Israel; <gloss target="#t_PLO1">PLO</gloss> officials repeatedly have declared it is
                        that organization's aim to see the state of Israel destroyed. We are
                        committed to a peaceful solution of the whole complex of Palestine issues;
                        the <gloss target="#t_PLO1">PLO</gloss>'s declared policies increasingly
                        indicate it sees no alternative to solving these problems than by force of
                        arms. Because of our role in Israel's creation and our support of Israel,
                            <gloss target="#t_PLO1">PLO</gloss> statements are almost invariably
                        hostile to the United States. We have made no public statements regarding
                        the <gloss target="#t_PLO1">PLO</gloss>. We do not recognize it as the sole
                        or even as an official representative of the Palestine people. It is the
                            <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>'s view that it has no official
                        status whatever.</p>
                    <p>In spite of the chasm between the <gloss target="#t_PLO1">PLO</gloss> and
                        ourselves, we do not wish to cut ourselves off entirely and irrevocably from
                        its members and officials as individuals. We believe that productive
                        relations can be established between <gloss target="#t_PLO1">PLO</gloss>
                        members and <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> officers. We do not believe
                        that we should undertake any kind of broad-scale campaign to establish such
                        relations, but neither should we ignore opportunities as might present
                        themselves. Such relations we believe are another way of demonstrating to
                        the Palestinians and other Arabs our continuing friendship for the
                        Palestinian people. There is of course the possibility of acquiring useful
                        intelligence. And finally the maintenance of these contacts would be a
                        useful hedge against some unforeseen and fundamental change in the Palestine
                        problem and our relation to it.</p>
                    <p>Accordingly the Department wishes to caution the posts that they should take
                        no action that might be construed as official recognition of the <gloss target="#t_PLO1">PLO</gloss>. They may acknowledge mail from individuals
                        in the <gloss target="#t_PLO1">PLO</gloss> but should not enter into
                        substantive correspondence with them as <gloss target="#t_PLO1">PLO</gloss>
                        officials. Officers should not call at <gloss target="#t_PLO1">PLO</gloss>
                        offices or encourage <gloss target="#t_PLO1">PLO</gloss> calls at embassies
                        or consulates. If <gloss target="#t_PLO1">PLO</gloss> officials wish to call
                        at <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> offices they should be received at a
                        subordinate level. Officers should not attend official <gloss target="#t_PLO1">PLO</gloss> functions. There is no objection, however,
                        to US officers' attendance of small, informal functions given by <gloss target="#t_PLO1">PLO</gloss> officers or ones at which the latter are
                        present, even as guests of honor.</p>
                    <p>Officers may where appropriate maintain unostentatious personal contact with
                        PLO officials. They may attend official host country functions at which
                            <gloss target="#t_PLO1">PLO</gloss> officials are present, though not
                        ones at which they are guests of honor.</p>
                    <p>For its part, the Department intends to receive any <gloss target="#t_PLO1">PLO</gloss> callers at the level of Office Director or below. It is
                        intended that any contacts by Department officers with <gloss target="#t_PLO1">PLO</gloss> officials outside the Department be kept at
                        a subordinate level and be unostentatious and informal.</p>
                    <p>The Department welcomes continuing reporting on the <gloss target="#t_PLO1">PLO</gloss> and individuals connected with it.</p>

                    <p>6049. <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> called on the Secretary
                        April 1 to appeal for immediate issuance of PA's under current Title I
                        agreement. Jernegan attended. No other memcon will be prepared.</p>
                    <p>Secretary said he hoped for another meeting soon when he would be in position
                        to discuss US–<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> relations across the board
                        officially and formally. Meanwhile, present meeting gave him opportunity to
                        consult <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> informally on ways to
                        reverse distressing trend in US–<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                        relations. One area of possible improvement was that of arms that <gloss target="#t_UARG1">UARG</gloss> had said publicly it was giving to Congo.
                            <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> sensed growing concern from
                        neighboring states about their involvement with Congo rebels. Perhaps <gloss target="#t_UARG1">UARG</gloss> concern was also growing. Problem of
                        blocking arms infiltration into South Viet-Nam made USG particularly
                        sensitive to arms infiltration into Congo. <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> had told all parties of its hope GDRC would maintain active
                        contact with other African states and with <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> in interest of resolving situation. <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> wanted to be able to concentrate its aid to Congo in fields
                        of economic and social development; it hoped Congo would not be drawn into
                        intra-African strife or East-West cold war. It seemed to Secretary that
                        provision of aid to rebels was not a very rewarding activity and created
                        difficulties for <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> efforts to rebuild
                        relations with <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> responded with his familiar case
                        for freezing Arab-Israel dispute and reactivating <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>-US cooperation. He said he felt gravity of situation
                        required him to make a frank, formal, and carefully studied presentation. He
                        felt that <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>-US relationship required
                        personal attention of Secretary and President. (Secretary assured <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> he and President had given
                        considerable time and thought to this subject.) <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> said problem was, not to assess blame, but to devise
                        workable formula for normalizing relations:</p>
                    <p>1) <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> should frustrate Israeli efforts to
                        take Palestine issue out of icebox. Israel did not need arms since <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter and US commitment against aggression
                        were adequate protection. Diversion of Jordan headwaters would take years at
                        best. <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> detected that many
                        Americans mistakenly viewed Arab-Israel conflict as central issue in Near
                        East, whereas real issue was how to preserve Near Eastern neutrality and <pb n="429" xml:id="pg_429" facs="0461"/>independence. As sincere friend of
                        US, <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> appealed to <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> not to provide arms directly to Israel.</p>
                    <p>2) <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> should resume full economic
                        cooperation with Egypt. From his January meeting with Secretary, <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> had understood PA's for amounts
                        remaining under current Title I agreement would be issued. So far no action
                        had been taken. <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> understood
                        difficulties posed <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> by Congo situation,
                        but people of Egypt must eat. On their well-being hung stability of whole
                        Near East. <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> appealed to <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> at least to provide urgent Egyptian needs
                        under <gloss target="#t_CCC1">CCC</gloss> or Title IV and begin negotiations
                        for conclusion of new Title I agreement.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> questioned identification of
                        Congo as critical issue in <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> relations.
                        His reporting had given <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> full
                        understanding of US position. As far as <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> knew, <gloss target="#t_UARG1">UARG</gloss> was no
                        longer providing arms to rebels. <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> could
                        hardly expect <gloss target="#t_UARG1">UARG</gloss> to provide affidavit to
                        this effect.</p>
                    <p>Secretary replied that, out of respect for <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName>'s dedication to US–<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                        cooperation, he wished to convey to <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName>, for his personal information only, full appreciation
                        of problem that Congo posed <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>. If
                        Administration should issue Purchase Authorization before Secretary was in
                        position to assure Congressional leaders that arms shipments from <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> to Congo had ceased, Congress would be
                        likely to enact legislation disqualifying <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> from any aid whatsoever. Just today, Secretary had received
                        perplexing report that Gbenye and rebel leaders were going to meet in Cairo.
                        Until Congress obtained necessary assurances, it could not be convinced
                            <gloss target="#t_UARG1">UARG</gloss> truly nonaligned. In view of
                        Ambassador's important statement that arms flow had stopped, Secretary would
                        review personally all information available to <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>. Any information <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> could provide on rebel meeting in Cairo would be
                        helpful.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> feared that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> failure to resume aid would defeat the
                        mutual objective of reviving cooperation. Citing his obligation to inform
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> of any trend he discerned
                        in Washington, he said reactivation of economic cooperation would strengthen
                        his hand in Cairo, but insistence on unattainable guarantee would frustrate
                        conditions in which Congo issue could be resolved. By withholding aid,
                            <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> was denying <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> the power to maneuver within his own
                        country. How could <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> urge more
                        concessions on <gloss target="#t_UARG1">UARG</gloss> when USG had made no
                        positive gesture in two years? It seemed that both his and Secretary's hands
                        were tied.</p>
                    <p>Secretary said that, while he comprehended <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName>'s broad approach to US–<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> relations, Congo was issue that loomed largest in his talks
                        with Congress and this was handiest lever by which to get US–<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> relationship back on tracks. He would
                        investigate possibility of <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>'s taking
                        certain specific actions and talk with <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> again.</p>

                        position on subject: US supports Unified Plan fully as Plan or yardstick. No
                        change in US position. It is not agreement and we do not believe parties
                        involved should be expected abide by “every dot and comma” as if they were
                        parties to agreed document. Projects now beginning take shape on upper
                        tributaries do not seem to accord with UDP and we have argued thus with
                        Lebanese. Must recognize argument that particular point does not agree with
                        UDP is of limited usefulness with Arab riparians. US would not acquiesce in
                        major divergences from UDP that would cause trouble. View held at highest
                        level <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> was that use force in this matter
                        not advisable and <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> could not acquiesce in
                        it. We counting on <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> use peaceful
                        means.</p>
                    <p>Without attempting answer directly to these points <persName corresp="#p_GM4">Gazit</persName> said he had two or three of his own to make. <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> was interested in Lebanese reaction to our
                        demarches. <persName corresp="#p_JJD2">Jernegan</persName> said Lebanese did
                        not accept all our arguments but they glad not to force issue. We could not
                        say how this would come out but we confident Lebanese would do all they
                        could to drag out matter.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GM4">Gazit</persName> said <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> considering suggestion made that it take up Lebanese
                        diversion projects in <gloss target="#t_ILMAC1">ILMAC</gloss>. Would make
                        decision in one or two days.</p>
                    <p>Re use force Gazit said <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> not trigger-happy
                        but could not be expected abjure force in matter of vital interest. For
                            <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> use of force was “last rather than
                        first thing.”</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_GM4">Gazit</persName> said <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> attached considerable importance to knowing whether US
                        agreed with Israel on out of country diversions (water transfer problem) and
                        out of basin diversions. Re latter Jernegan said it clear from record
                        Johnston negotiations out of basin diversion contemplated <pb n="431" xml:id="pg_431" facs="0463"/>for Israel but not for Arabs. This was not
                        helpful argument to use with Arabs, however. As for out of country diversion
                        this apparently not contemplated by negotiators. It hard to say whether it
                        considered and turned down.</p>

                        wondered whether US felt it doing all it could. <persName corresp="#p_JJD2">Jernegan</persName> said we were and assured him we would continue our
                        efforts. Pointed out we had most influence in Beirut and after that, though
                        considerably less, in Cairo. If we could increase our influence in Cairo

                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>'s request is for a <gloss target="#t_CCC1">CCC</gloss> credit sale of 200,000 tons of corn, which
                        would cost it an estimated $10–12 million depending on market prices.</p>
                    <p>1. This isn't aid. It is a private dollar sale whereby a private US exporter
                        can buy from <gloss target="#t_CCC1">CCC</gloss> for resale to the UAR after
                        he gets a US private bank guarantee (just in case the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> doesn't pay). The interest rate is 4–5%
                        plus 1–1/2% for the guarantee.</p>
                    <p>2. The terms are near commercial. In fact, we allow only a year to pay on
                        corn, in order to permit US exporters to compete with European <pb n="432" xml:id="pg_432" facs="0464"/>sellers. France just sold the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> wheat on 3-year terms. Agriculture regards
                            <gloss target="#t_CCC1">CCC</gloss> sales as meeting normal marketing
                        requirements; i.e. as commercial sales not aid.</p>
                    <p>3. Nor is this much of a carrot for <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>. We made two <gloss target="#t_CCC1">CCC</gloss>
                        credit offers last year which the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> never
                        took up. So one problem is that such a gesture might be too piddling to
                        accomplish much.</p>
                    <p>4. There is no Agriculture press release, though Agriculture doesn't hide
                        these matters and they could be picked up. If there is a query we could put
                        out the above legitimate story, which our AID and State people think ought
                        to carry weight with the Congress. In fact <persName corresp="#p_MWBJ1">Macomber</persName> tried the <gloss target="#t_CCC1">CCC</gloss>
                        gambit on L. H. Fountain yesterday and got a favorable reaction.</p>
                    <p>We are living on pins and needles lest Nasser blow the whistle on US arms
                        sales to Jordan and Israel. Even a minor gesture like the above could do a
                        lot to keep alive <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s hope that
                        he can still do business with the US. Once he decides he can't, we're in for
                        a blow. The real test will come over the remaining $37 million in Title I PL
                        480.</p>

                            Hassan Sabri Al-Khouli and an Embassy officer. Al-Khouli stated
                            emotionally, “Don't you realize that the Palestine question is more
                            important to us than Vietnam, Yemen and Congo all put together is to
                            you? You [are] having your way in Palestine. You have pressured us to
                            accept your selling arms to Israel.” He also declared: “Now it looks as
                            though you want to use your food to pressure us on the Congo in addition
                            to Palestine.” <persName corresp="#p_BLD2">Battle</persName> noted that
                            this was the clearest indication yet of <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> acquiescence in U.S. arms sales to Israel.</note> If

                        sales to us. And it's much more important than the Congo, where we're

                        since receipt second <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss> came late
                        afternoon April 7 following his return from Aqaba. Since most of same ground
                        had been covered with him before, I couched presentation in terms of request
                        from Washington that I review with him before departure for Geneva meeting
                        current <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> thinking on Middle East and his
                        own earlier request that we be completely frank with him. I then made
                        detailed statement based on first reftel. I added expression of appreciation
                        for his recent comment to <hi rend="italic"> NY Times</hi> that he
                        understood Harriman mission had been helpful, and in discussing drift of
                        some Arab states toward Sovbloc said I could not refrain from noting his
                        government planned sign agreement for use of Soviet radio programs whereas
                        they had never been willing use ours. While admitting this different type of
                        drift, said Washington could hardly refrain from speculating on such
                        action.</p>
                    <p>King listened attentively and then said he wished comment on some of points
                        made. First he appreciated frankness of approach. He had always desired
                        intimate and honest exchange of views with <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> on area problems but in past had never felt this fully
                        achieved. He hoped Washington would be willing make possible continuation of
                        discussions this nature. He placed great value in relationship with Western
                        powers which stood for things in which Jordan believed and above all else he
                        desired preserve this relationship. Second, he was pleased American
                        Ambassadors in Near East meeting together and he hoped we would take very
                        hard look at US policy in area and particularly at possibilities of some
                        rather drastic new ideas or initiatives. Admitted he did not have solution
                        which he wanted to sell but felt that for too long <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> had reacted to events rather than trying to influence them
                        in proper direction. Only hope for peace and stability in area, he felt, lay
                        with U.S. and other Western friends.</p>
                    <p>As for behavior of Arab states, he admitted this had not been what it should
                        have been not because of summit but despite summit. Summit <pb n="434" xml:id="pg_434" facs="0466"/>decisions in his opinion had been
                        essentially correct but some leaders were going back to pre-summit
                        atmosphere. This was very dangerous and his policy, as he had shown in West
                        German case, was based on determined effort to maintain Arab unity even when
                        this involved minor concessions on items where Jordan would otherwise have
                        disagreed. He recognized however that Arabs must do more than this; they
                        must work together constructively and in particular begin to deal with
                        internal problems of economic, political and social growth. This has been
                        his effort in past few weeks in Jordan and would continue to be major point
                        of his domestic policy. We could expect further changes, both in personnel
                        and concepts within coming weeks.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> [garble] agreed there had
                        been drift to left in some Arab states, particularly Syria and <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, but he still adhered to belief Arabs would
                        not become Communist. However this was problem which needed careful
                        attention for Communists were only ones gaining from present tensions. As to
                        report of agreement for Soviet radio programs, he knew nothing of this and
                        would look into it. Did not think I should take matter seriously (report had
                        come from Under Secretary Information) and in any case if <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> reached such decision, they would make
                        comparable agreement with <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Jordan water question was without doubt at very critical state, though he
                        considered this more symptom of underlying dispute than real cause of
                        difficulty. Arab states would not and could not stop diversion works, though
                        it remained to be seen whether these works would seriously hurt Israel.
                        However, he felt Israel had embarked on determined effort to halt Arab
                        works. Therefore he suggested that for planning purposes <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> work on hypothesis that hostilities would
                        ensue in 1965. He hoped these could be limited and under [no?] circumstances
                        would Arabs attack, and perhaps out of it all some sensible agreements could
                        be reached. But at moment he could not see entirely peaceful resolution of
                        issue.</p>
                    <p>On arms question he felt we were guilty of miscalculation. As <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> well knew, he firmly believed Israel was
                        expansionist power determined to acquire more territory. Balance of arms
                        which was needed in area was one which would convince Israel it could not
                        continue aggressive policies, push out its frontiers and constantly strive
                        for more territory. Only when Israel recognized this could there be
                        resolution of basic issue. There was no question of “driving Israel into
                        sea” but equally Arabs would not sit back and accept further encroachments.
                        His great concern was that US approach on arms to Israel was not designed to
                        create kind of balance he had in mind but rather was one which constantly
                        tempted Israel to flaunt its power in face of weaker neighbors. He was
                        particularly conscious of this because Jordan was most exposed and stood to
                        lose most if hostilities resulted.</p>
                    <pb n="435" xml:id="pg_435" facs="0467"/>
                    <p>Finally, he said he wanted to enter plea that we so conduct ourselves as not
                        to give <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> another club with
                        which to beat Arabs or West, since all Arab states and Western interests
                        would inevitably suffer. Queried to his meaning, he said he felt that it
                        important that we continue wheat shipments with minimum fanfare so that
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> would really have to stand
                        up and face horrible economic mess he has made of Egypt. If we stopped
                        shipments, <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> would charge
                        Western imperialist conspiracy against Egypt and make political capital out
                        of it, thus hiding what was real problem inside Egypt. <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> implied without so stating that he
                        anticipated that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, if we
                        stopped wheat shipments, would call for nationalization of oil so that
                        greater profits could be made available to Arab world and hence to Egypt,
                        but in process seriously damage position of oil producing states and of
                        West.</p>

                    <p>Born in Safad, Naqib went to Syria in 1948 and attended Washington State
                        University from 1951 to 1956. He obtained a license as a medical laboratory
                        technician in the United States and then returned to Syria where he
                        established in partnership with a General Saba a medical laboratory which is
                        still in operation. Naqib is married to a girl from Haifa. They expect a
                        child in May. Naqib is a serious type in <pb n="436" xml:id="pg_436" facs="0468"/>his late 30's, bespectacled and balding, who speaks English
                        quite well and conveys an impression of combined reasonableness and
                        determination.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital"> Naqib's Mission in the U.S.</p>
                    <p> Saad said that, in accordance with what he understood to be the preference
                        of the State Department, the <gloss target="#t_PLO1">PLO</gloss> would not
                        attempt to open an office in Washington. However, it was contemplated that
                        he would assign office space and secretarial assistance to Naqib and the two
                        would work closely together—the primary difference being that Saad
                        represented the 13 members of the Arab League while Naqib represented the
                        14th unofficial member of the League, Palestine. Neither was a registered
                        lobbyist and their purpose would be through press, radio, TV, and public
                        speeches to get their message across to the American people. They were not
                        here to cultivate officials or members of Congress. Mr. Jones stated that
                        the Department of State was unable to maintain formal relations with the
                        Palestine Liberation Organization. On the legal side, it did not represent a
                        sovereign entity. On the practical side, it was widely regarded in the
                        United States as an organization dedicated to terminating the existence of a
                        state that we recognized. Naqib suggested that the Department view the
                            <gloss target="#t_PLO1">PLO</gloss> as an organization dedicated to
                        promoting the rights of the Palestinians. Mr. Jones said that on that basis
                        he would be pleased to provide any personal assistance to Mr. Naqib.<note n="2" xml:id="d204fn2">No record of any further contact with Naqib
                            during the period covered by this volume has been found.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Arab-Israel Dispute</p>
                    <p>Mr. Jones stated the Department's conviction that there is no military
                        solution to the Palestine problem. We hope eventually that the military and
                        political situation would evolve to the point of making war obsolete, but
                        for the foreseeable future the possibility of a military solution was
                        negated by the American commitment to oppose aggression from any quarter.
                        Therefore, the resolution of the Arab-Israel dispute would have to come
                        about gradually in accordance with basic political, economic and social
                        forces which we hoped would eventually promote the acceptance of the people
                        of Israel by the Near Eastern community. Saad and Naqib listened to this
                        statement without comment.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Arab Unity</p>
                    <p>When this subject came up, Jones stated the Department's position, adding his
                        own personal belief that, since Arab disunity appeared to breed instability,
                        any trend toward unification would appear to be in <pb n="437" xml:id="pg_437" facs="0469"/>the American interest. He had no idea how
                        such a trend might be established, whether collectively or by accretion, but
                        in any event it was a matter to be dealt with by the people of the area
                        themselves without any intervention from the United States or any other
                        foreign country. Naqib remarked that history offered no examples of unity
                        that had not been achieved by military action. In reply to a question about
                        the background of the Unionist insurrection in Damascus in July 1963, Naqib
                        said that it had been staged by Jasim ‘Ulwan and apparently was easily
                        suppressed because it had been penetrated by the Baath. The regime had used
                        this coup as a pretext to arrest several Unionist leaders who had had no
                        connection with the plot whatsoever. Among those were Muhammad Jarrah, Ra'if
                        Ma'arri, Muhammad Sufi, and Naqib himself, who spent nearly a year in Mezze.
                        Jones commented that the failure of the regime to prosecute Jarrah had given
                        rise to the story that he had been a double agent. Naqib denied this report
                        categorically, saying that the report of early release was false, that
                        Jarrah was with him in Mezze, and that in any event Jarrah could not have
                        been a double agent since he had known nothing about the plot.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">“Let My People Go”</p>
                    <p>During a discussion of the problem of getting the Arab message across to the
                        American people, Jones attempted to make a distinction between defense of
                        the rights of the Palestinian refugees and defense of the need of the Jewish
                        people for a refuge from persecution. He cited the MetroMedia production
                        “Let My People Go” as a very effective presentation of the latter thesis—a
                        thesis to which the vast majority of Americans firmly subscribe. Those Arabs
                        who advocated blacklisting Xerox for having sponsored this film would make
                        the mistake of confusing these two issues, thereby doing disservice to their
                        cause. In the absence of offers by other countries to accept the Jewish
                        refugees in Germany during the war, it was difficult to blame the Jews for
                        trying to reach Israel. In fact, perhaps the Arab states could blur Israel's
                        unique position as the Jewish national home if they should offer to hold
                        their borders open in perpetuity to the Jewish refugees and their
                        descendants. Naqib's reaction to this observation was stony, but Saad noted
                        that in past centuries the Arab world had played just such a role for Jewish
                        refugees from European persecution and that as late as World War II the
                        Sultan of Morocco had resisted Vichy directives to discriminate against his
                        Jewish subjects.</p>

                        of US–<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> relations by <persName corresp="#p_FM5">Fawzi</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_KAM2">Kaissouni</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> and

                            <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> was visiting Cairo and
                            other Near Eastern capitals. Telegram 3626 from Cairo, April 15,
                            reported most of the conversation with Deputy Prime Ministers <persName corresp="#p_FM5">Fawzi</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KAM2">Kaissouni</persName>. (Ibid., POL <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>-US) The portion of the conversation reported in

                            ibid.</note> This discussion occurred at end of luncheon with no note
                        takers present. Although <persName corresp="#p_FM5">Fawzi</persName>'s
                        response was suave and very general, we believe message got through.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> pointed out certain elements in
                        American political life had consistently opposed US assistance programs to
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> but these—notably what Egyptians
                        identified as Zionist groups—had never by themselves dictated US policy. Of
                        late, however, much broader spectrum of American public life becoming
                        troubled at indications <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> involved in
                        “liberation” movements undermining governments of other free countries. This
                        was what ChiComs and Soviets, latter in part spurred by aggressive stance of
                        former, currently pursuing in less developed countries. Since World War II
                        US had expended great treasure and effort to block various forms of
                        aggression. There had been successes. We believed no nation could conceive
                        at this stage in history of nuclear war as instrument of aggrandizement, in
                        view of intolerable risks and consequences. Nor would any government today
                        be likely to face consequences of world reactions to movements of massed
                        troops across frontiers. US now deeply engaged in coping with third form of
                        aggression, secret infiltration of trained soldiers and terrorists across
                        frontiers, which being practiced by Communist nations. World had not yet
                        found fully adequate answer to this type of attack. Its seriousness raised
                        questions about policies not only of Communist countries but of others which
                        seem to practice it.</p>
                    <p>We had therefore been greatly concerned, as <gloss target="#t_UARG1">UARG</gloss> knew, <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName>
                        continued, by <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> support of Congo rebels.
                        In addition, we were troubled when <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                        fingers seen in difficult situations elsewhere, as in South Arabian
                        Federation, Persian Gulf, North Africa, Cyprus, etc. Some thought these
                        grounds for ending US efforts develop constructive relationship with <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. At minimum, they clearly questions needing
                            <pb n="439" xml:id="pg_439" facs="0471"/>to be resolved as we examined
                        how US–<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> relationship could be put back on
                        constructive basis.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_FM5">Fawzi</persName> thanked <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> for candor of his comments. Rather
                        surprisingly, he said he was relieved that this was extent of our problems.
                        In Cairo's view, these matters should be discussed in full frankness between
                        us whenever US had specific worry.</p>
                    <p>Sometimes our views might differ. He did not wish to rebut points
                        specifically, however, but rather to urge that our representatives discuss
                        in detail any that might arise. Rest of conversation faded into
                        generalities.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: Relatively mild response by <persName corresp="#p_FM5">Fawzi</persName> will presumably not be last we hear
                        from this conversation which touched bone of our relationship with <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. At worst it could bring a strong <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> response, probably from other officials and
                        perhaps even from <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>. More
                        hopefully, it could have broken way open for Ambassador to pursue specific

                        meeting with Nasser Sunday.</p>

                        again to strength <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> opposition to possible

                        entry into nuclear weapon field. I said I was speaking without instructions
                        and I had no intention of making threats. However, although US <pb n="440" xml:id="pg_440" facs="0472"/>position had been made entirely clear in
                        recent <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName> talks and on other occasions, I told

                        but impressive comments the Secretary made to me privately last week in
                        Geneva. The Secretary had remarked on his own initiative and not in response
                        to any prompting or query on my part that in either event “the US Government
                        would pull out.” I said that my quote might well be inaccurate and in any
                        case the language was not preformulated with precision. To me the importance
                        of this comment is that it emphasizes the seriousness with which the highest
                        levels of the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> would view such Israeli

                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>: This meeting is important to both US
                        and <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. We hope it will produce

                        policy adjustments essential to resumption of US aid. Egyptians are looking
                        for a signal that US declarations of desire to resume aid are sincere.</p>
                    <p>With expiration of Title I agreement approaching and Egyptians in grim mood,
                        we wish to accord them such a signal. We suggest following approach: End
                            <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>1. Open on a candid note by remarking you have just come from chiefs of

                        interested in knowing how participants see present situation in Near East.

                    <p>2. At this point, to promote atmosphere of give and take, you might solicit
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s views on these
                        matters.</p>
                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> may, as <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> has advised, broach <gloss target="#t_UARG1">UARG</gloss> desire for resumption of aid. If not,
                        might be advisable for US side to broach it. Moving from area problems to
                        Egyptian problems, you might note <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                        understanding of weighty economic problems <gloss target="#t_UARG1">UARG</gloss> faces. You might go on to indicate <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> regret that our support for efforts to find solutions these
                        problems has lately been blocked by US–<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                        policy differences. It might be well to review at some length the
                        deterioration of the climate of opinion regarding the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> in Congress as a reflection of wide-ranging
                        sentiment throughout the country. While there are a number of major policy
                        differences between the US and <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, the
                        Congo problem was the proximate cause of the latest difficulty. The
                        Administration made a major effort to obtain authority for the President to
                        continue useful economic relations with the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. It succeeded only by making it clear that a substantial
                        improvement in relations must precede such further cooperation.
                        Congressional reaction focused heavily on arms shipments to the Congo and
                        the cessation of such shipments was clearly made a condition to the
                        resumption of assistance.</p>
                    <p>This is not to say that many Americans are not continuing to work toward the
                        improvement of US–<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> relations. For
                        example, Eugene Black's reports of his conversations in Cairo have been
                        helpful in clearing the air.</p>
                    <p>4. You might elicit <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s views on
                        prospects for reviving satisfactory climate.</p>
                    <p>5. If <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s reply is encouraging,
                        we suggest you convey following:</p>
                    <p>a) <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> willingness to consider now Egyptian
                        request for <gloss target="#t_CCC1">CCC</gloss> credit for corn. <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>: Terms on wheat (6 months) not likely be
                        competitive with European offers but better on corn (12 months). End <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>b) Your desire to bring about the assurance of further purchase
                        authorizations to complete Title I agreement and your intention to work to
                        this end provided that in the meantime the <gloss target="#t_UARG1">UARG</gloss> can see its way clear to stop arms shipments to the Congo.
                        (We leave it to you to develop a form of words that will make this point
                        clear without sounding too much like an ultimatum.)</p>
                    <p>c) You would hope a period of quiet and steady improvement would create
                        favorable Congressional climate for negotiation new Title I agreement.</p>
                    <pb n="442" xml:id="pg_442" facs="0474"/>
                    <p>6. You might conclude with reaffirmation of genuine <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> desire for cooperation. Our insistence on improvement in
                        climate is not capricious but reflects political realities that cannot be
                        ignored. <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has global interests and
                        commitments to consider which we hope <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> will recognize.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>. As we see it, <gloss target="#t_UARG1">UARG</gloss> believes it has made some difficult political
                        concessions—notably tolerance of arms sales to Israel. Longer <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> delays in reciprocating, greater is danger
                        that Egyptian extremists will foreclose possibility of salvaging US–<gloss target="#t_UARG1">UARG</gloss> cooperation.</p>
                    <p>By reopening tap to allow thin stream of economic aid, we perceive better
                        than even chance of confirming <gloss target="#t_UARG1">UARG</gloss> on its
                        present conciliatory course. This action would be consistent with
                        ambassadors' findings (Geneva's 1599).<note n="4" xml:id="d207fn4">Telegram
                            1599 from Geneva, April 12, reported that <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> and U.S. Ambassadors to Near Eastern countries,
                            who were meeting in Geneva, recommended completing the deliveries of
                            surplus grain to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> committed under
                            the current P.L. 480 agreement. (National Archives and Records
                            Administration, <gloss target="#t_RG1">RG</gloss> 59, Central Files
                            1964–66, AID (US) <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>)</note> It would
                        demonstrate that we are not stringing Egyptians along—that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has will and capability to meet concession
                        with concession. (We suspect FRG is thinking along similar lines in regard
                        to its own problems with <gloss target="#t_UARG1">UARG</gloss>. Embassy will
                        have noted the several reports, of which German Foreign Office appears to be
                        unaware, that Werner carried aid package to Cairo.)</p>
                    <p>“Satisfactory climate” cannot be defined in terms of specific issues. It will
                        obtain when sum total of <gloss target="#t_UARG1">UARG</gloss> positions on
                        major issues between us reflects conscious Egyptian effort to adapt to
                            <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> requirements. However, improvement
                        in regard to Congo must be part of picture. End <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>For Bonn: Above position is preliminary, not to be discussed with FRG.</p>

                    <p>3652. From <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName>. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BLD2">Battle</persName> and I had two and one-half hour talk
                        with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> today ranging fully over
                            US–<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> relations and many other issues
                        in world affairs. He had obviously been briefed carefully on my earlier
                        talks with his Ministers and officials and had done his homework
                        sufficiently well so almost all points I had raised were skillfully woven
                        into his comments and responses to my questions.</p>
                    <p>Tone was personally cordial throughout. He was candid in comments about
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> policies, tactics and difficulties,
                        and equally candid in complaining about certain aspects of US policy. For a
                        time we concluded he had decided to pursue fairly stiff line. However, this
                        turned out to be in part protective coloration for specific concessions to
                        points we have been urging on <gloss target="#t_UARG1">UARG</gloss> in
                        recent weeks. Nugget he dropped in middle of fairly assertive discussion on
                        Congo situation was flat statement <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> not
                        now providing arms to Congolese rebels. In discussion of nuclear
                        proliferation, he stated equally definitely that <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> will accept <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>
                        safeguards on reactors it builds, large as well as small.</p>
                    <p>He gave us clear impression he has decided to swallow US arms sales to
                        Israel, however unpalatable. He stated Arab water diversion works will not
                        exceed, at least by much, Johnston Plan allocations. Also indicated current
                        disinterest on Cyprus situation, though he helped Makarios last summer.</p>
                    <p>On other hand, he raised signals of possible further difficulties with Saudi
                        Arabia on Yemen and with British over SAF. He suggested prompt Amer-Sulatan
                        talks to clear misunderstandings over his agreement with <persName corresp="#p_FAAAS1">Faisal</persName>. He urged that US stop bombing
                        attacks on North Vietnam to give NVN chance to respond to proposals for
                        negotiations.</p>
                    <p>It was clear our decision to sell arms to Israel was much on his mind. We
                        discussed principal Arab-Israeli issues including Jordan waters and refugees
                        as well as arms in detail. He repeatedly averred that Israel can influence
                        US policy but Arabs cannot.</p>
                    <p>At end of session I made offer, as authorized in my instructions, of US
                        readiness to consider <gloss target="#t_CCC1">CCC</gloss> sales of wheat and
                        corn on credit terms of six and twelve months, respectively. I also said we
                        hoped for prompt decision on remainder of current PL480 agreement. I
                        expressed <pb n="444" xml:id="pg_444" facs="0476"/>further hope that
                        together we could achieve improvement of climate of relations necessary to
                        enable us to enter negotiations for new PL480 agreement.</p>
                    <p>Extensive telegraphic memcon being dictated rather hurriedly before my
                        departure Jidda and will follow promptly.<note n="2" xml:id="d208fn2">Telegram 3653 from Cairo, April 18. (Ibid.)</note> Suggest Department

                        appropriate.</p>
                    <p>I have now had many hours of talk with <gloss target="#t_UARG1">UARG</gloss>
                        officials. It is apparent to Ambassador and me that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s decision to tell us no arms being
                        sent to Congolese rebels represents firm <gloss target="#t_UARG1">UARG</gloss> policy decision to attempt to meet conditions we have laid
                        down for completion existing PL480 agreement. For variety of reasons well
                        understood in Department, I believe it very important we now respond by
                        prompt issuance of purchase authorities. You will not be surprised to learn
                        that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BLD2">Battle</persName> fully agrees.
                        This leaves open for further discussion in coming weeks and perhaps months
                        the question of a fresh PL480 agreement. That, rather than further dialogue
                        on the existing agreement, seems to me the proper occasion for further
                        examination of the many and real problems remaining between US and the

                    <p>629. <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 619<note n="2" xml:id="d209fn2">Telegram 619 from Amman, April 22, reported that some
                            tanks had recently been stationed on the West Bank. Prime Minister Tell
                            had stated that this was a purely defensive move and that the tanks
                            would be withdrawn in the near future. Telegram 583 to Amman, April 17,
                            instructed the Embassy that if further information confirmed the
                            presence of a battalion of tanks on the West Bank, it should raise the
                            subject with King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>. (Both
                            ibid.)</note>—<gloss target="#t_JAA1">JAA</gloss> tanks. Saw King
                            <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> afternoon April 21 re
                        redeployment <gloss target="#t_JAA1">JAA</gloss> tanks. Reminded him of our
                        earlier conversation <pb n="445" xml:id="pg_445" facs="0477"/>and his
                        assurance that under normal circumstances tanks would be kept on East Bank
                        and that he would do everything possible to avoid provocative actions. Said
                        I recognized that he and he alone could make decisions re legitimate self
                        defense requirements of Jordan, but I had nevertheless been requested to
                        raise question of tanks on West Bank since this seemed contrary to his own
                        earlier assurances. Added that we had absolutely no evidence of any Israeli
                        build-up or redeployment and under circumstances we were fearful that
                        stationing of tanks on West Bank could trigger very reaction we all sought
                        to avoid. Said that we recognized his concerns over dangers inherent in
                        present state of tension and were doing everything in our power to prevent
                        resort to arms as solution to present problems. His recent action in
                        redeployment of tanks if known on other side could well work against
                        objectives which I thought we both shared.</p>
                    <p>King replied that it was quite correct he had earlier given assurances that
                        under normal circumstances tanks would be retained on East Bank and he felt
                        that he was still operating within framework of those assurances and his own
                        responsibilities for providing all possible defense for Jordan. First, he
                        could hardly describe present situation as being “normal circumstances”
                        which he and I had previously discussed. He had no evidence of an Israeli
                        build-up but he had to face stark reality that Israel had categorically
                        threatened to stop Arab water works by force if necessary. This meant to him
                        that conflict was inevitable and under circumstances he had to take such
                        measures as he could to protect Jordan. Second, tanks that were moved were
                        Charioteers which could hardly be considered a threat. They had been
                        deployed in defensive positions as an anti-tank weapon and in fact they were
                        only anti-tank weapons now available to him. Third, all other tanks
                        including all U.S. models had been retained on East Bank and would continue
                        to be kept there. It was true that he had ordered certain redeployments in
                        last few weeks but in every case he had kept major installations way back
                        from frontier and nothing that had been done could in the least be
                        considered provocative. Fourth, he felt that in his own national interest it
                        was essential that he maintain adequate defense of northwestern frontier
                        against possibility of tank attack which he would under other circumstances
                        be unable to halt. Putting his tanks into defensive positions today rather
                        than after an Israeli build-up was detected seemed less provocative than if
                        this were done at later date.</p>
                    <p>In summary, he said he hoped that Washington would recognize fact that he had
                        not undertaken a provocative action; that this redeployment was relatively
                        minor and entirely defensive in nature. He said he would be glad to have me
                        discuss other changes in military formations that caused us concern, but as
                        he had told me before my departure <pb n="446" xml:id="pg_446" facs="0478"/>for Geneva, he thought <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> had to proceed
                        on hypothesis that Arab states and Israel were now on collision course and
                        that conflict appeared inevitable in course of year. Until situation
                        basically altered he would have to take reasonable precautions but he could
                        assure us once again Arab states would not initiate any hostilities.</p>

                    <p>Noting <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName> and I had already discussed
                        Jordan waters issue (see following septel),<note n="2" xml:id="d210fn2">Telegram 1360 from Tel Aviv, April 23. (Ibid.)</note>
                        <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> professed to be flabbergasted
                        by <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> characterization of UDP as
                        “yardstick” by which water usage should be measured. He asked that we ensure
                        King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> know if Jordan accepted
                        water diverted from Lebanon or Syria, Israel would reopen whole question of
                        Jordanian utilization of Yarmuk.</p>
                    <p>At <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>'s request I outlined my
                        impressions of current situation in Arab Near East, particularly <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s position. I said area trends
                        during next six months should be watched closely to see whether Arab summit
                        spirit would continue prevail or traditional inter-Arab rivalries again come
                        to fore. I stressed persistence of apparently genuine Arab fear of
                        geographic expansionism by Israel. PriMin strongly reiterated there no
                        intention nor need for Israel's territorial expansion.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> made usual plea, without
                        specifying precisely how it might be done, that we utilize aid to <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> so as to moderate <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s policies.</p>
                    <p>Next I stressed our interest in seeing area arms problem eased. Our
                        approaches had undergone three phases. First on conventional arms, we had
                        again re-examined US policy and again determined our <pb n="447" xml:id="pg_447" facs="0479"/>best course was to continue exercise
                        restraint in supplying arms to principal parties Arab-Israel dispute, with
                        rare exceptions. Second, on missiles we had made thus far unrewarded
                        efforts. We agreed with Israel that <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                        missiles not now effective weapons. Third, re nuclear proliferation
                        President Johnson, as was President Kennedy, is very seriously concerned.
                        This was vital global problem, not one related merely to Arab-Israel
                        confrontation. It most important that <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>
                        safeguards be applied to nuclear reactors in this area. <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> opined disarmament problem should be
                        faced in above order, i.e., conventional arms first and nuclear last. I said
                        we had indications <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> would accept <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards. <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> thought if Nasser accepted safeguards and got a large
                        reactor, he might well then remove reactor from <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> system.</p>
                    <p>After review subjects reported separately,<note n="3" xml:id="d210fn3">Telegram 1362 from Tel Aviv, April 23, reported that after their
                            discussion of <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards,
                                <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> said he thought the
                            Israeli Government could not foreswear nuclear weapon development in the
                            absence of binding security guarantees, but that “we are so far
                            (presumably from having a nuclear weapon)—it would take huge sums of
                            money, then there would be problem of delivery vehicle. But we can't
                            afford not to think about it, not to try to know all about it,” because
                            of the Israeli Government's responsibility for the survival of the
                            Jewish people in the face of Arab threats. The quotation marks and the

                        <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> stressed Israel not preparing for
                        “war” in connection water issue. I took occasion reiterate our firm
                        opposition to use of military force. <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> said he construed our position as opposing
                        “preventive war,” not necessarily opposing “normal shooting” that goes on
                        along borders expecially on Syria-Israel border. I stressed we opposed all
                        shooting as means to solve area problems. <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> exclaimed, “It will be done (i.e., Israel would do
                        some shooting). We will not sit quiet for a long time. Arabs can cut off 150
                        MCM's of Israel's water.” I said as <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> well
                        aware from <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName>, Ambassador, and others, if Israel
                        resorted to shooting “You would find US opposed to you.” To this <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> said, “We'll see. The President told
                        me US would back Israel on the water.” I emphasized President was referring
                        to Israel's getting its share of Jordan waters, not about use of force to
                        attain that end. <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> said “OK, you
                        get the water without force, what do you advise?” I said it would be long
                        time before Arabs could divert more water than that allocated them under
                        UDP. <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> claimed this was mistaken
                        estimate; Arabs could complete diversion projects in two years if allowed to
                        work without interference.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> requested US move Embassy to
                        Jerusalem. Everyone, with possible exception French, was waiting for this US
                        lead. I said this was not simple bilateral issue; it had important
                        international implications. I did not see our moving Embassy as being in the
                        current picture. <pb n="448" xml:id="pg_448" facs="0480"/>
                        <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> complained same current picture
                        had obtained almost 18 years. Failure Western powers move to Jerusalem added
                        unnecessary element uncertainty. I pointed out no country outside area had
                        devoted more effort than had US in attempting settle Near East
                        uncertainties. We had worked hard on refugees, water, and other basic
                        problems.</p>
                    <p>At close of meeting, which was extended on <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>'s initiative to over one hour, he said he would give
                        much not to be compelled to use “a little force” on water issue, but water
                        was Israel's life-blood and if necessary Israel would have to fight for it.
                        I stressed, as I had to Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName>,
                        that if we are to give help on this issue, our views on how we can best help
                        must be considered. We did not consider threat of use of force at all
                        helpful, particularly vis-a-vis delicate political situation in Lebanon.</p>

                    <p>2. (S) The Joint Chiefs of Staff reiterate their view (<gloss target="#t_JCSM1">JCSM</gloss>–953–63, dated 7 December 1963)<note n="3" xml:id="d211fn3">Printed in <ref target="frus1961-63v18#d383">Foreign
                                Relations, 1961–1963, vol. XVIII, Document 383</ref>.</note> that
                        our Middle East arms policy should not positively identify the United States
                        with either side in the Arab-Israeli conflict. Every attempt should be made
                        to avoid a polarization in the Middle East whereby the United States becomes
                        increasingly identified with Israel and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> with the Arab World. Such polarization would have the
                        undesirable consequence of promoting an anti-US Arab unity under United Arab
                        Republic leadership. This process would tend to weaken the comparatively
                        moderate, pro-Western Arab governments while strengthening Soviet influence
                        among the Arab states. Sale to Israel of US offensive weapons, such as tanks
                        and aircraft, can be expected to generate Arab reactions which would be
                        detrimental to US political, military, and economic interests in the Middle
                        East. The impact of US military sales to Israel is discussed in Appendices A
                        and B hereto.<note n="4" xml:id="d211fn4">The appendices are not
                            attached.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>3. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) Although the Israelis have requested 75
                        combat aircraft, presumably bomber aircraft, the Memorandum of
                            Understanding,<note n="5" xml:id="d211fn5">See <ref target="#d182">Documents 182</ref>-<ref target="#d185">185</ref>.</note> as
                        understood by the United States, provided for no more than 24 aircraft. The
                        Joint Chiefs of Staff believe that the addition of even 24 jet light bombers
                        to the Israeli inventory would provide a significant relative increase in
                        the Israeli military capability, and the addition of 75 bomber aircraft
                        would create a drastic change in the present military balance which cannot
                        be justified on military grounds. With the addition of Hawk missiles,
                        scheduled to become operational about 15 May 1965, the Israeli air defense
                        system will provide an acceptable defense against the numerically superior
                        United Arab Command offensive air capability.</p>
                    <p>4. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) Israel's combat aircraft needs have been
                        filled in the past from United Kingdom and French sources. The United States
                        should avoid sale of any US combat aircraft to Israel, particularly bomber
                        aircraft. Every effort should be made to persuade Israel to continue to
                        satisfy its combat aircraft requirements from Western European sources. The
                        British Canberra Mk II or the French Vautour II B (especially if it were
                        equipped with the Spey engine) would give Israel a satisfactory bombing
                        capability. Both aircraft are expected to be available.</p>
                    <p>5. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) If a political decision is made to sell
                        US aircraft, bomber aircraft should not be offered, since this would
                        increase the severity of the Arab reaction. If US aircraft must be provided,
                        the F–5 aircraft is the best available compromise on the basis of
                        performance, cost, political considerations, and impact on US military
                        posture. Although its performance <pb n="450" xml:id="pg_450" facs="0482"/>does not meet the stated Israeli requirement, it is probable that Israel
                        would accept the F–5 in order to obtain a US aircraft. Other US and Western
                        aircraft which could be considered for sale to Israel are listed in
                        Appendices C and D hereto. These aircraft are listed in the order of
                        preference for sale to Israel if the F–5 is unacceptable.</p>
                    <p>6. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) The Memorandum of Understanding commits
                        the United States to provide tanks to Israel of at least the same number and
                        quality as those sold to Jordan. In addition, it commits the United States
                        to deliver the remaining 110 tanks from the German tank arrangement. In
                        additional negotiations, Israel has asked the United States to furnish 100
                        M–48–A2C tanks to balance the initial commitment of 100 M–48s to Jordan and
                        to furnish 100 M–48–A2Cs to fulfill the German contract. Consummation of the
                        foregoing will significantly increase Israeli qualitative superiority.
                        Therefore, in order to reduce Arab reaction, it is recommended that the
                        M–48–A1 only be considered for sale to Israel in fulfillment of the
                        Memorandum of Understanding to balance the tanks sold to Jordan. Moreover,
                        any sale of current US Army M–48–A2 or newer model tanks would have an
                        adverse impact on the armored capabilities of the US Army, whereas the sale
                        of earlier model M–48–A1 or M–48 tanks would not.</p>
                    <p>7. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) Since Israel has preferred in the past
                        to consider self-propelled guns such as the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> SU–100 in the category of armor and in view of the
                        offensive capability of 155mm SP weapons, the Joint Chiefs of Staff
                        recommend that, if such equipment is requested, sales be approved only if
                        the number of tanks sold is reduced by a corresponding amount.</p>
                    <p>8. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) If the Israelis were to acquire, as
                        postulated in the reference, 310 M–48 type tanks, 60 self-propelled 155mm
                        weapons, and 250 Centurion tanks, the Arab-Israeli arms balance would be
                        tipped in favor of Israel to a significant degree by the end of 1967.</p>

                            summit conferences held in Cairo and Alexandria in 1964 had agreed on a
                            “plan” or conditions for solution of the Palestine problem. Department
                            officials had noted references to such a “plan” in a number of Arab
                            responses to recent proposals by Tunisian President Habib Bourguiba for
                            a Palestine settlement. (Ibid.)</note> raises interesting question which
                        this Embassy has pondered for many months. Do actions and commitments
                        arising from two Arab summit conferences constitute an integrated “plan?” We
                        believe the answer, not surprisingly, is “yes and no.”</p>
                    <p>Arab summit I was hastily called by <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> to devise ways and means short of offensive military
                        action to respond to Israel off-take of Tiberias water. Arab summit I
                        succeeded in achieving this objective, but it set other policies and
                        institutions in motion which, up to present, like Topsy have “just growed.”
                        These can be fitted together in some fashion to make up a “plan” but such a
                        “plan” contains several contradictory elements.</p>
                    <p>Main aspects of Arab summit policies include:</p>
                    <p>1. Arab counter works on Jordan tributaries. This involves joint financing on
                        Arab territories of engineering works calculated to use water from the
                        Jordan system. Arabs tell us confidentially this will not involve off-take
                        significantly greater than Johnston Plan allocations. Publicly they indicate
                        this will harm Israel economy and Israel offensive action against Arab works
                        on Arab territories must be expected.</p>
                    <p>2. <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss>. To deal with this contingency armed
                        forces of Arab states surrounding Israel must be strengthened and
                        preparations made for back-up military support of other Arab states. Up to
                        present we have no indications that <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss>
                        planning other than defensive. But imaginative and wishful-thinking Arabs
                        must be discussing contingencies whereby <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss>
                        “defense” has been so effective that it can quickly move to offense. This
                        wishful thinking having fairly wide impact on Arab public opinion.</p>
                    <p>But we believe sober Arab leadership contemplates Arabs developing sufficient
                        force to create a military stalemate with Israel. Then <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and/or great powers are expected to step into
                        situation and force a settlement on terms favorable to Arabs.</p>
                    <pb n="452" xml:id="pg_452" facs="0484"/>
                    <p>3. Politico-economic preparation. To achieve <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>/great power support at critical juncture postulated above,
                        Arab summiteers decided on such steps as stepped up propaganda campaign,
                        visits of Arab delegations to world capitals to “explain” Arab viewpoint,
                        etc. They also made motions of progress toward policies whereby united Arab
                        economic pressure (mostly oil) could be brought to bear on Western countries
                        to bring them around to Arab viewpoint.</p>
                    <p>4. Palestine liberation. This is where most contradictions occur. Three
                        elements above can be said to form reasonably comprehensive plan. But it
                        became obvious between two Arab summits that Palestinians themselves should
                        be given greater role. As result, “liberation of Palestine” became
                        proclaimed goal, and <gloss target="#t_PLO1">PLO</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_PLA1">PLA</gloss> were established. Goal of “liberation”
                        simply cannot be reconciled with defensive politico-military-economic
                        strategy outlined above. Results confuse everybody. Ambitious but untrusted
                        Palestine refugee leader <persName corresp="#p_SA12">Shukairy</persName>
                        tries to equate <gloss target="#t_PLO1">PLO</gloss> with bodies that
                        liberated Algeria from France. But Arab leaders obviously refuse to go
                        along. While <gloss target="#t_PLO1">PLO</gloss> sits as member of Arab
                        summit conference it has been made clear that (unlike PGRA) it is not a
                        “government” and should not be recognized as such by other governments
                        including Arabs. While Palestine “army” has been created, it has no
                        independent life of its own but operates as part of the United Arab Command.
                        Arabs generally seem apprehensive over <persName corresp="#p_SA12">Shukairy</persName>'s direct contacts with Red China, Jordan fears
                        fruition of <persName corresp="#p_SA12">Shukairy</persName>'s ambition would
                        curtail its own sovereignty, <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> miffed at
                            <persName corresp="#p_SA12">Shukairy</persName>'s attempt dominate Arab
                        League over Bourguiba issue.</p>
                    <p>Foregoing is Arab “plan” as it appears to us after following Arab summitry
                        for nearly eighteen months and many conversations with Egyptians and other
                        Arab officials in Cairo. We do not believe there is more to “plan” than
                        this. Our belief is that “plan's” basic internal contradictions are in
                        effect the seeds of its own destruction. But, as suggested in last sentence
                        reftel, Embassy will pursue its inquiries in this matter as opportunities
                        arise.</p>

                        conversation with King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> and
                        Prime Minister Tell May 6 I had suitable opportunity to inquire specifically
                        what they meant by Arab “plan” for dealing with Palestine. King replied
                        immediately that Arab plan was simply (1) decision to proceed on divergence
                        of Jordan waters coupled with (2) decision to build up Arab armies to point
                        where they would be able to defend against any Israeli attack on diversion
                        plan. This was full content of any plan on which Arab leaders had agreed.
                        [garble—Bourguiba] had been attacked because he went beyond this framework
                        without consulting other Arab leaders and in particular because timing of
                        his public proposals had been most tragic in view of present emotional state
                        of eastern Arabs. Prime Minister confirmed that this was all he had meant by
                        his own reference to a collective plan.</p>
                    <p>King went on to say that there was absolutely no intention of trying to
                        destroy Israel. He appreciated our efforts over past few months to restrain
                        Israel from any preemptive military move and our assurances that we were
                        prepared to defend independence and territorial integrity of Jordan. In long
                        run however, this not sufficient and Arabs obviously had to feel they were
                        in position themselves to defend against any Israeli aggression. This
                        required improvement in their military posture and “balance” in the military
                        power of two sides which he was afraid was different from kind of balance
                        which we had in mind. However, there was tremendous difference between being
                        in a military position to defend against attack and being in a military
                        position to destroy Israel; latter was totally beyond their intentions or
                        even reasonable economic capabilities of Arab states.</p>

                            He thought the basic problem was that “there could be no <gloss target="#t_PLO1">PLO</gloss> as defined by Shuqairi alongside

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Discussion</p>
                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">The Pressures on Israel:</hi> The arms rivalry in the
                        Near East has reached a dangerous stage. As U.A.R. missile technology
                        improves, Israel seeks to develop an unmatched, economical counterdeterrent.
                        This seems destined to lead to development of nuclear warheads for Israeli
                        missiles purchased from France.</p>
                    <p>2. The Israeli Strategy: Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> has told us orally that Israel's nuclear activity is
                        peaceful and that Israel would not be the first to introduce nuclear weapons
                        into the Arab-Israel area. He later said, however, that Israel could not
                        forever foreswear nuclear weapon development in the absence of binding
                        security guarantees. (In 1963 President Kennedy determined that we could not
                        afford politically to guarantee Israel's security and that, in any event,
                        such a guarantee would not give Israel better protection than our present
                        close association and commitment to oppose aggression in the Near East
                        provide.) We must remember Israel deliberately misled us initially about the
                        nature of the nuclear facility at Dimona. Therefore, we must assume Israel
                        intends to make its decisions on whether to produce nuclear weapons without
                        consulting us. Lower level Israeli officials speak frankly about Israel's
                        strategy toward the United Arab Republic: a) surface-to-surface missiles
                        targeted on the Nile delta, and b) a capability to bomb and release the
                        waters behind the Aswan High Dam. Destruction of the Aswan Dam would require
                        a nuclear warhead; bombing with high explosives could not be counted on to
                        do the job.</p>
                    <p>3. <hi rend="italic">What We Can Do:</hi> Our efforts to slow down the U.A.R.
                        sophisticated weapons program—as well as potential nuclear weapons programs
                        in India and elsewhere—will be influenced by the example we set in dealing
                        with Israel. We very much need a breakthrough on the problem of preventing
                        proliferation by presently non-nuclear states. The world recognizes Israel's
                        nuclear capability and the fact we have compelling leverage on Israel
                        because of our special relationships. So long as the Dimona reactor operates
                        without publicly recognized safeguards, the credibility of our worldwide
                        efforts to prevent proliferation is in doubt. Moreover, acceptance of
                        safeguards in contrast to promises of peaceful intent would provide tangible
                        evidence of Israel's good faith.</p>
                    <p>Israel has signed the partial Test Ban Treaty, is a member of <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>, and has accepted <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards on its small research reactor
                        provided by the United States. It is, therefore, reasonable for us to ask
                            <pb n="456" xml:id="pg_456" facs="0488"/>Israel to accept <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards on all of its nuclear
                        facilities. If Israel does not intend to produce a nuclear weapon,
                        acceptance could lose only the questionable deterrent provided by fear of an
                        unknown nuclear capability. <hi rend="italic">Unilateral action by Israel to
                            place all of its nuclear facilities under <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards would place great international pressure on
                            the U.A.R. and other states to follow suit</hi>. The U.A.R., which has
                        consistently opposed safeguards since the establishment of <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>, recently has demonstrated a new, more
                        forthcoming attitude. President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> confirmed to Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> on April 18, U.A.R. acceptance of the
                        principle of international safeguards. This more flexible attitude
                        encourages the hope the U.A.R. may agree to application of safeguards, not
                        only to the large power reactor for which it is now shopping, but to all its
                        nuclear facilities. The prospect of Israeli acceptance of safeguards could
                        provide an added inducement.</p>
                    <p>We should make clear to Israel we expect another U.S. team of scientists to
                        visit Dimona after the parliamentary elections next November. At the same
                        time, we should press Israel now for acceptance of <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards immediately after the elections. To obtain
                        maximum leverage, we should make our approach before the arrival in mid-May
                        of an Israeli military team to discuss direct U.S. arms sales to Israel.</p>
                    <p>I think that you alone carry the weight to persuade <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> to take this unilateral action. For
                        this reason I am enclosing a draft letter that you might send to him.</p>
                    <p>There is great urgency about this matter in view of the disturbing signals we
                        have been getting from Israel. I think, therefore, that this is something we
                        must come to grips with promptly. A letter along the lines of the enclosed
                        would seem an essential initial step.</p>

                    <p>It was my intention to send to Washington, my colleague and friend Dr.

                        view on a number of important issues with events occurring in the Middle
                        East or beyond it, and which directly or indirectly affect relations between
                        our two countries.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>If I may stress a few points, I wish to underline the following:</p>
                    <p>1. The United Arab Republic is very anxious to maintain Arab-American
                        friendship and underlines the necessity of its permanent consolidation.
                        While unfortunately, we find obstacles and difficulties impeding this
                        objective, we have and still do exert all efforts to keep the door open
                        before a free and responsible exchange of ideas and viewpoints. We sincerely
                        maintain that this door should be kept open in the interest of the American
                        and Arab peoples and for the sake of peace in a delicate and sensitive part
                        of the world.</p>
                    <p>2. The United Arab Republic has not started or planned the arms race in the
                        Middle East, but the United Arab Republic was compelled, following
                        inadmissible armed provocations, to afford itself the ability of legitimate
                        defence against a hostile and expansionist danger represented in the racist
                        Zionism, to which imperialism has facilitated the usurpation of a parcel of
                        the Arab land, to be used as a base to menace the will of the Arab nation
                        for freedom and as a barrier against Arab aspiration to unity.</p>
                    <pb n="458" xml:id="pg_458" facs="0490"/>
                    <p>The records—those of the United Nations included—bear witness to the fact
                        that the United Arab Republic has used its armaments only in defence rights,
                        while aggression always came from those who know they adopt a position
                        hostile to nature itself and to history and which is incompatible with the
                        principles of justice and law. Events of 1956 are fraught with proofs and
                        meanings.</p>
                    <p>3. It is regrettable indeed, that a number of Western countries in general,
                        undertook the responsibility of arming Israeli aggression through dangerous
                        transactions mostly concluded secretly: these include what France offered
                        Israel in early 1956, while the last of these transactions was the offer
                        made by the Government of Federal Germany to Israel, the repercussions of
                        which still remain in the area strong and violent.</p>
                    <p>The Government of West Germany occupied an excellent position in the Arab
                        world, and it is regrettable to the Bonn government and to the West as a
                        whole, that this prominent position which formed a bridge between the Arabs
                        and the West and was a vast path for positive and fruitful co-operation,
                        should be destroyed.</p>
                    <p>Yet, the United Arab Republic is still determined not to allow bitterness to
                        be the centre of accumulation to Middle East forces.<note n="4" xml:id="d215fn4">Telegram 4013 from Cairo, May 17, reported that the
                            correct translation of this sentence was as follows: “Nevertheless the
                                <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> is still determined that
                            bitterness should not result in the polarization of power in the Near
                            East.” (National Archives and Records Administration, <gloss target="#t_RG1">RG</gloss> 59, Central Files 1964–66, POL
                            ARAB–ISR)</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>The difference is basically between the Arab nation and Israeli aggression
                        and its expansionist aims. Here, I wish to observe that efforts, often
                        unbearable, are exerted to restrict the dispute to that framework.</p>
                    <p>4. The people of the United Arab Republic find and are convinced that the
                        true challenge they face is for the achievement of progress and the
                        development of their life socially, economically and culturally, so that
                        they might lead a life in line with their age, and contribute, with other
                        nations, to the honouring of human value. I wish to state that the
                        constructive achievements of which the Egyptian people carry the burden,
                        constitute a brilliant example of the determination of peoples, who found
                        themselves bound by the chains of underdevelopment—to reshape their lives in
                        spite of great difficulties that burden them and force themselves around
                        them.</p>
                    <p>The people of the United Arab Republic believe that the arms race is a
                        temporary feature, put in motion by bitter experience and crises, and
                        supported by suspicion every day. Yet, what will finally resist and last is
                        life alone, built by the determination of men, their creative minds <pb n="459" xml:id="pg_459" facs="0491"/>and their ability to exploit all
                        resources afforded them in the fields of production and services.</p>
                    <p>The outbursts of aggression can but destroy themselves, and the will of life,
                        always remains stronger than all its enemies.</p>
                    <p>Please accept, dear President, kindest respects and very best wishes. (sgd)
                        (Gamal Abdel Nasser)”</p>

                    <p> Abe Feinberg called on the President tonight, and the latter asked me right
                        over. Subject was Israeli worries on arms, especially the planes.<note n="2" xml:id="d216fn2">On April 19, Gazit gave the Department of State a
                            request for Israeli purchase of tanks, planes, and other military
                            equipment. (Telegram 1075 to Tel Aviv, April 20; National Archives and

                    </p>
                    <p> Feinberg's plaint was that the Israelis were concerned about: (a) our
                        evasiveness on the matter—they couldn't even get any information; (b) in
                        wigging <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> on the recent
                        unprovoked Israeli pre-emptive attack on Syrian bulldozers, <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> had said we couldn't even discuss
                        arms if this sort of thing was going on.<note n="3" xml:id="d216fn3">The

                            in which <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> pressed for a
                            response to Israel's request for arms purchases. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> replied that the response was
                            being formulated but raised the subject of the recent incidents on the
                            Syrian border, noting that the United States opposed the use of force in
                            the water issue and stating that if the evidence clearly showed Israel
                            was involved with military initiatives, it would not be possible to
                            proceed with military talks. (Telegram 1184 to Tel Aviv, May 19;
                            ibid.)</note>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> was most upset over this
                        linking of Israeli behavior and our arms agreement (<persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> had personally told poor Phil to do
                        this), so had poured out his woes to Feinberg.</p>
                    <p>I explained the circumstances, and how unhappy we were over the Israeli use
                        of strongarm tactics (the Syrians didn't even fire back). The President
                        backed me up, and asked Feinberg to tell <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> we couldn't accept shooting and killing on the water
                        issues.</p>
                    <p>On the planes I explained how we frankly doubted that Israel had made much
                        effort to explore European sources first. We had to insist <pb n="460" xml:id="pg_460" facs="0492"/>that if Israel could get planes there it
                        should do so. The President was good as gold on this too, telling Feinberg
                        he knew the Israelis wanted “US” planes, but that we weren't going to come
                        through unless there was no other alternative.</p>
                    <p>He then told me to give Feinberg all the fill-in he wanted, and to make sure
                        we lived up to our agreement. We were going to be hard bargainers, but we
                        didn't welsh on any deals. He then explained to Feinberg his worries that
                        he'd ruined Erhard's chances for re-election. We had a little discussion of
                        the <gloss target="#t_BG1">BG</gloss>/<persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> squabble (Feinberg thought <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> sure to win) and that was that.</p>
                    <p>I then took Feinberg off and mollified him, explaining some of the reasons
                        for the delays and assuring him that everything was reasonably on the
                        tracks, so long as the Israelis behaved. To give him a little something to
                        say to <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>, I told him I thought we
                        could deliver a few tanks before the Israeli election to back <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>'s hand. On the planes, however, we
                        were sure there were adequate European types available—probably better than
                        we could provide. If the Israelis were smart they'd stop wasting time trying
                        to probe our availabilities and latch on to the best European deal they
                        could. If they ran into roadblocks they could ask our help. We wouldn't let
                        State drag its heels too much—but Israel had to play ball too.</p>
                    <p> Feinberg's next worry was how he could reassure various groups in US Jewry
                        who were hearing about arms to Jordan and wondered how Israel could be
                        protected. He'd have a big problem here when the 1966 elections rolled
                        around. I told him in spades that secrecy was still the order of the day,
                        although by the time of the 1966 campaign we might be able to take off the
                        wraps a bit.</p>
                    <p>I taxed Feinberg gently for squawking to the President too quickly, but
                        blamed it on <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName>. Feinberg hastened
                        to explain that he hadn't sought an appointment for this purpose; he was
                        going to Israel so had asked if the President would like to see him first.
                        He'd been invited, and only when he came down today and saw <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> had the latter poured out his woes.
                        Ergo, I shouldn't tax <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> for
                        having gone around end. Having made my point, I subsided.</p>

                    <p>However, <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s May 1 speech also
                        seems to have foreshadowed a hardening of Egyptian attitudes toward us on
                        some issues. Aspects of that speech particularly unpalatable to <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> were <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s endorsement of the “liberate Palestine” theme and
                        his blunt treatment of possible cessation Title I program. Since that time
                        Cairo's “Voice of Palestine” has attacked <gloss target="#t_HKJ1">HKJ</gloss> for frustrating <gloss target="#t_PLO1">PLO</gloss>'s
                        proposals, <gloss target="#t_UARG1">UARG</gloss> has reportedly reinforced
                        its troops in Yemen in apparent contradiction to its ostensible support for
                        Numan's conciliation campaign, Akhbar has criticized the three Arab
                        hold-outs on the Germany/Israel issue, Ahram has launched a campaign against
                        Libya and Wheelus Field, and <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>

                        US disarmament initiatives but also misrepresented them.</p>
                    <p>We can understand compulsion Egyptian regime must feel to present itself to
                        public in best possible light, to placate Soviet Union, to throw up an
                        anti-American smoke screen to camouflage fact of its pulling back on the
                        Congo, and even to prod <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> a bit. We
                        suppose <gloss target="#t_UARG1">UARG</gloss>'s problem of image-maintenance
                        is painfully complicated by uncertainty of PL–480 program. If current
                        agreement not renewed, <gloss target="#t_UARG1">UARG</gloss> will have
                        unenviable task of explaining to a people who suffered losses in Yemen why
                        they must now go on half-rations in Egypt. We suppose allegations about US
                        pressures that Nasser made in public May 1 and in parliament May 16 were
                        made to justify regime's position if US aid is cut off.</p>
                    <p>However, at best these considerations are irrelevant to US interests and at

                    <p>Dear Mr. Prime Minister:</p>
                    <p>I have been thinking over our exchanges on visits to the Dimona reactor as
                        well as recent unfortunate publicity on this subject. I can understand that
                        secret visits pose problems for you. On the other hand, failure to make such
                        visits on a regular basis poses a difficult problem for us and we feel
                        compelled to continue them. Recognizing, however, that you face
                        parliamentary elections and that a visit before they are held would cause
                        you increased internal political problems, we have agreed to defer the next
                        six-monthly visit until after the elections.</p>
                    <p>A preferable alternative to these bilateral arrangements would be for Israel
                        to place the Dimona reactor and all other nuclear facilities under IAEA
                        controls, as you have already agreed to do for the Nahal Soreq reactor and
                        for any U.S. materials or equipment transferred to Israel in connection with
                        the U.S.-Israel desalting program. Because of our unalterable opposition to
                        any further proliferation of nuclear weapons, our policy is to press for
                        extension of <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> or similar safeguards to
                        all nuclear facilities in those countries not now possessing nuclear
                        weapons. We have made substantial progress thus far, and nineteen countries
                        including the United States have accepted <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> controls over all or part of their nuclear facilities.</p>
                    <p>Such action by Israel would help establish an effective ceiling beyond which
                        the Near East arms race would not escalate. In order to protect Israel from
                        any political injustices in the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>—which
                        we by no means anticipate or even believe could occur—my government is
                        prepared to support a statement by Israel with a withdrawal clause on the
                        part of Israel that it would give up safeguards unless its own neighbors
                        accepted them.</p>
                    <p>We do not see any U.A.R. nuclear capability for the foreseeable future and
                        are convinced the U.S.S.R. will not supply <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> with <pb n="464" xml:id="pg_464" facs="0496"/>nuclear
                        weapons. Suspicion that Israel is developing nuclear weapons, however, might
                        stimulate <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> to make concessions
                        to the U.S.S.R. that could result in a Soviet nuclear support program
                        similar to the one that was attempted in Cuba. Voluntary adoption of <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards would cost Israel only the
                        questionable deterrent provided by fear of an unknown nuclear capability,
                        would clearly demonstrate Israel's peaceful intent to the whole world, would
                        go far toward easing area tensions and abating the arms race, and would put
                        pressure on other countries to do likewise.</p>
                    <p>I make this proposal earnestly and strongly urge you give it your most
                        serious consideration. For the next several years, Israel can rest secure in
                        the knowledge of its military superiority over the Arabs and the steadfast
                        assurances of U.S. support against aggression. Our military experts consider
                        U.A.R. missiles only a psychological threat with negligible military
                        potential. In my judgment an initiative by Israel to adopt <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards would be in its own interest,
                        since it would help assure Israel's long-term security by removing the
                        threatening shadow of nuclear war in the Near East. Israel's example would
                        also reinforce our efforts to persuade President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> to limit sophisticated weapons acquisition and
                        encourage other countries to renounce the awesome decision that
                        automatically would make them subject to possible preemptive attack. We have
                        reason to believe the U.A.R. will accept <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards if it acquires a large nuclear reactor.</p>
                    <p>I realize that the delicate internal political situation in Israel might make
                        acceptance of <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards difficult at
                        this time. I urge you, therefore, to consider agreeing now to accept these
                        safeguards after your parliamentary elections this fall.</p>
                    <p>You may be sure that our interest in the security of your country remains
                        unchanged. The grave responsibility which this puts upon us is an important
                        factor in my conviction that we must leave no stone unturned in our efforts
                        to maintain peace.</p>

                        asked what the U.S. attitude is to such firing. I replied that we had never
                        concealed our disapproval of Syrian attacks on Israeli fishermen and

                        misunderstanding of U.S. position in regard to such Israeli actions and
                        repeated that if such actions lead to security council consideration the
                        U.S. will not be able to support Israel.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister acknowledged his understanding of U.S. attitude. He continued
                        with familiar line that Israelis would be in a worse position to counter
                        Arab diversion after diversion projects completed than they are now in
                        attempting persuade the Arabs of folly and dangers of carrying out their
                        diversion plans. I endeavored again to rebut this reasoning along usual U.S.
                        line emphasizing that it by no means certain Arabs will complete diversion
                        and particularly that these <pb n="466" xml:id="pg_466" facs="0498"/>Israeli
                        attacks involve risk out of proportion to dangers to Israel from diversion
                        schemes at present underway or in prospect. As expected, Prime Minister was
                        not sold by these arguments although he obviously does not entirely dismiss
                        them. He said he recognizes risks but aside from indicating to Arabs
                        strength of Israeli determination in matter he believes May 13 incident may
                        have served useful purpose of demonstrating Israeli capability of
                        interdicting diversion works by measures short of full-scale war. He also
                        thought it might be welcomed by Lebanese in that Syria instead of Lebanon
                        was Israeli target.</p>
                    <p>These points of course are not new, the Prime Minister having advanced them
                        on various previous occasions. It is clear, however, that he still holds to
                        his thinking tenaciously and will be dissuaded if at all only with
                        difficulty.</p>
                    <p>Subsequently Argov (acting head of U.S. Dept, FonOff) referred to <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName>'s conversation with <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName>, reported <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 1184, particularly connection <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> made between such Israeli initiatives and <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>-U.S. military talks. Argov sought to argue
                        that these two separate matters. I responded that Talbot's meaning seemed
                        quite clearly to contrary and commented that in any event it obvious that
                        relations between states must be considered as a whole and it impossible to
                        treat issues in isolation without reference to generality of each state's
                        concerns.</p>

                            conversation is ibid., POL 27–14 ISR–JORDAN.</note> Secretary called in
                        Israel Ambassador May 28 to express deep concern over Israeli military raids
                        into Jordan territory May 27–28. He said <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                        took serious view such activities on peaceful frontier. Timing raids during
                        meeting Arab Prime Ministers in Cairo made situation even more explosive.
                            <pb n="467" xml:id="pg_467" facs="0499"/>
                        <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> had hoped that in view its clearly
                        expressed opposition to use of force such activities would not occur.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> explained attacks not
                        on Jordan but on bases of Fatah organization which since January had been
                        conducting raids against civilian targets in Israel. Ambassador reviewed
                        number such incidents including 1) February 27 attack on Kfar Hess which
                        gave rise to Israel's letter to Security Council; 2) March 4 incident along
                        Negev border which <gloss target="#t_UNTSO1">UNTSO</gloss> investigation
                        indicated was work of organized group for which Jordan responsible; and 3)
                        Recent increase in sabotage during May culminating in Ramat Hakovesh and
                        Afula attacks.</p>
                    <p>Israeli attack aimed at three places: 1) Shuneh where training base and arms
                        cache of Fatah destroyed, 2) Qalqiliya which jump-off point for attacks on
                        Kfar Hess and Ramat Hakovesh, and 3) Jenin from which Afula attack mounted.
                        Ambassador stressed need for Jordanian responsibility for activities within
                        its borders and attacks emanating from within Jordan. Israel had exhibited
                        patience when sabotage caused no casualties but attacks on inhabited areas
                        intolerable. Ambassador hoped Jordan would derive lesson from raids and take
                        more serious view regarding need control Fatah.</p>
                    <p>Secretary noted: 1) incident at Qalqiliya involved not just pinpoint sabotage
                        but sustained artillery fire; 2) some question regarding what occurred at
                        Afula since <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> apparently blocking further
                        investigation incident; facts available cast doubt upon Jordanian
                        responsibility for incident; and 3) Jordan had said it would concert with
                        Arab nations for joint action in retaliation to Israeli attacks. This could
                        lead to serious situation. Secretary requested resume of Fatah incidents
                        with indication those reported to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.<note n="3" xml:id="d220fn3">Telegram 1227 to Tel Aviv, May 29, transmitted a

                        Israel do everything to restore calm and not permit escalation of military
                        activity. While Israeli contention that Jordan responsible activities
                        individuals within its territory valid as general proposition, sovereign
                        governments cannot always guarantee behavior individuals.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador said Israel anxious avoid military escalation but believed that

                        responsibilities.</p>

                    <p>2. Offer 100 M–48A1 tanks to offset sale similar number basic M–48 tanks to
                        Jordan. In view of Israeli request that M–48A1's be delivered before
                        M–48A2c's to permit early conversion, deliveries to Israel would be made
                        over four months beginning in mid-January 1966. US could deliver M–48A2c's
                        ahead of M–48A1's if Israelis change their minds.</p>
                    <p>3. Provide kits to install 105-mm guns on 110 M–48A2c tanks and 140 M–48A1
                        tanks (40 from Germany and 100 from the US) in Israel.</p>
                    <p>4. Provide 140 kits for conversion in Israel of Israel's M–48A1 tanks to
                        M–48A3 configuration. In view known Jordanian desires and comparability of
                        Jordan and Israel tank sales (see <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss>
                        898 and US-Israeli Memorandum of Understanding),<note n="3" xml:id="d222fn3">See <ref target="#d183fn2">footnote 2, Document 183</ref> and <ref target="#d185">Document 185</ref>.</note> implication clear US will
                        in due course be under strong pressure to supply Jordan M–48A3 tanks with
                        105-mm guns.</p>
                    <p>If Israel should press for delivery of 100 M–48A2c instead of M–48A1 tanks
                        (as we think they will) to offset the Jordan sale, we could probably agree
                        (unless it turns out that it seriously degrades US forces), provided we
                        supplied neither kits for conversion of the 40 M–48A1's in Israel to M–48A3
                        configuration, nor kits to up-gun any of Israel's M–48 type tanks. Since
                        these M–48A2c models could not be delivered before 1967 this concession
                        would have advantage of broader phasing of deliveries and less political
                        impact on Israel's neighbors. Any up-gunning kits would have to come from

                        Ministry in Jerusalem had reiterated June 7 to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Barbour</persName> that the Israeli Government
                        seriously desires a return to tranquility in the border areas and that it
                        wishes to cooperate with the Jordanian authorities to bring this about.
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Barbour</persName> in recent days had
                        also been given copies of messages sent by the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> to the Jordanian and Lebanese governments via the <gloss target="#t_MAC1">MAC</gloss>s containing lists of individuals suspected
                        of Fatah connections. There were 29 names on the list for Jordan and a
                        single name on the list for Lebanon.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GM4">Gazit</persName> said his government hoped the
                        United States Government would go back to King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> in a follow-up to his initiative with Ambassador
                            <persName>Barnes</persName> several days ago<note n="2" xml:id="d223fn2">Telegram 732 from Amman, June 3, reported a discussion between

                            sponsoring the group, was completely opposed to its alleged activities,
                            and was making every effort to control the border against infiltrations.
                            He expressed willingness to have his comments communicated to Israeli
                            officials. (Ibid., POL 31–1 ISR–JORDAN) On June 4, <persName corresp="#p_DRP1">Davies</persName> gave <persName corresp="#p_GM4">Gazit</persName> the substance of telegram 732, stressing that the

                            (Ibid.)</note> and, in addition to stressing to the King the Israeli
                        desire for a return to peace along the border, would raise a number of
                        specific points relating to the recent border events. These points had been
                        enumerated to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Barbour</persName>, but
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GM4">Gazit</persName> said he would mention some
                        of them as examples. For one thing, the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
                        does not understand why the official Jordanian letter to the Security
                        Council concerning the May 31 Jerusalem incident<note n="3" xml:id="d223fn3">The Jordanian letter, dated June 4, responded to a June 1 Israeli

                            documents <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>/6415 and <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>/6397)</note> is at odds with what has been learned from
                        the Jordanians themselves to be the real explanation. The <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> wonders what kind of punishment <pb n="472" xml:id="pg_472" facs="0504"/>Jordan will impose on the army captain
                        arrested because of that incident, which it considers to have been most
                        serious. Israel fails to understand Jordan's apparent inability to spot
                        saboteurs moving toward the border, since groups of several persons rather
                        than simply individuals have been involved in some cross-border
                        incidents.</p>
                    <p>The Israeli Government would continue to supply information concerning Fatah
                        complicity in the sabotage incidents, said Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GM4">Gazit</persName>, though it could hardly supply such a quantity that it
                        became in effect a branch of the Jordan security services. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GM4">Gazit</persName> expressed gratitude on behalf of the
                        Israeli Government for the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>'s readiness
                        to transmit such information and more general messages to Jordan on its
                        behalf. He went on to note that his government believed the onus was now on
                        King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> to see that border
                        tranquility was restored.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DRP1">Davies</persName> said that U.S. intelligence
                        confirmed the serious desire and efforts of King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> to keep potential saboteurs in check. He noted that
                        it was a little too much to assert that Jordan had absolute control of such
                        activities. Nearly 200 Israeli soldiers had, after all, moved almost
                        unnoticed well into Jordan territory during the May 27–28 raids, and even
                        the Israeli security forces could not detect individuals or groups of
                        infiltrators immediately on entry into Israel. He stressed that the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> was quite convinced that any further
                        Israeli military raids would push the Jordanians into some sort of military
                        reaction.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GM4">Gazit</persName> referred to <gloss target="#t_PLO1">PLO</gloss> efforts to raise a Palestine Liberation
                        Army and stated his government was impressed by the serious steps in
                        process, particularly in Gaza. He spoke of the seriousness with which the
                            <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> viewed the question of keeping
                            <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss> ration cards from <gloss target="#t_PLA1">PLA</gloss> conscriptees. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DRP1">Davies</persName> agreed this was a serious question,
                        reiterated the steps the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> had taken with
                            <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss> officials regarding it, and
                        expressed again the hope that this issue would be kept out of the press
                        since the glare of publicity would render <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss> action much more difficult. Regarding the <gloss target="#t_PLO1">PLO</gloss>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DRP1">Davies</persName> said it seemed clear that the Arab states principally
                        concerned were holding the organization at arm's length. There was a danger,
                        however, in the extent to which the Chinese Communists could make good on
                        Peking's reported promises to Shuqairy of funds, arms and training.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GM4">Gazit</persName> read brief passages from a
                            <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> letter to the Security Council
                        regarding the June 1 explosions at Yiftah and Beit Guvrin,<note n="4" xml:id="d223fn4">Dated June 4; not printed. (<gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> document <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>/6414)</note>
                        and spoke briefly of two more recent border incidents. At Beit Qama (about
                        13 miles north of Beersheba and 6 miles from the Jordan border) an Israeli
                        watchman had come upon four intruders cutting the fence <pb n="473" xml:id="pg_473" facs="0505"/>around a water tower and had thereby
                        prevented damage to the installation. At Jisr Shaikh Hussein the Jordanians
                        had fired across the border for 45 minutes with no apparent cause. Mr.
                        Moratt commented that the Jordanians now claimed to have repulsed two
                        Israeli attacks, neither of which in fact ever existed. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DRP1">Davies</persName> commented that the Jordanians
                        undoubtedly were apprehensive about possible incursions. He emphasized that
                        the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> is counseling restraint on all
                        parties concerned although our leverage in one location (Damascus) is at an
                        extremely low level.</p>

                        pressing us to enrich the secret arms deal as much as possible. Since we've
                        done even better than they originally expected on tanks, they're now zeroing
                        in on aircraft.</p>
                    <p>When I was out there, they talked about an old light bomber like the B–66,
                        which they thought they could buy for peanuts. We agreed to help them get up
                        to 24 “combat” planes (not necessarily bombers) either in Europe or here.
                        Since then we've convinced them that the B–66 is not available as surplus so
                        now they're asking for the F–4, our fanciest current operational model.<note n="2" xml:id="d224fn2">A June 10 letter from <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName>

                            Europe and was looking to the United States for a plane such as the

                    <p>The F–4 is (a) simply outside the spirit of our understanding; (b) would cost
                        them a mint; and (c) would raise hob with the Arabs. <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> is very strongly opposed; he doesn't
                        even want to sell old planes.</p>

                        talk. We can always take another look later. The alternative is not to bring

                        did contain rice export quotas and other provisions which the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> probably did violate at least in 1964.</p>
                    <p>State argues that the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> fell short of its
                        export quota in 1963 almost as much as it exceeded in 1964, so these should
                        be offset. We have this sort of problem with many PL 480 clients, and have
                        had to work them out by agreement. Agriculture is willing to go ahead on
                        this basis so long as we put the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> on
                        notice that this matter must be cleared up, especially before any new PL 480
                        agreement. To meet <pb n="475" xml:id="pg_475" facs="0507"/>any adverse
                        publicity, we have the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> Ambassador's
                        authority to say that the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> fully agrees
                        to negotiate out any such issues to our mutual satisfaction.</p>
                    <p>This is a messy problem, and will generate some flak, however we move. But
                        the Secretary of State makes a powerful case for giving <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> just enough rope to limit the risk
                        of a difficult confrontation in the Near East. I can only add my sober

                    <p>Despite the Javits speech, Congress and the press reacted with restraint on
                        the whole to the $37 million food for the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. There was relatively little other adverse comment, though
                        Gruening, Farbstein, Pelly, Michel and Horton said the expected. The returns
                        aren't all in, and we hear that Michaels may try to amend the appropriation
                        to block all aid to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. But the telling
                        argument was willingness to honor a commitment, not sympathy for <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>.</p>
                    <p>We moved just in time to spoil partly a big Soviet propaganda coup. In
                        desperation <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> got Moscow to
                        divert 300,000 tons of its own purchases from Canada and Australia, which he
                        doubtless planned to announce with fanfare once he decided there was no hope
                        from us. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> also apparently got
                        some wheat on credit from Mexico and Argentina. All this, plus the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>'s own crop, will fill Egyptian needs
                        through the winter. So it relieves pressure on us, and gives us time to sort
                        out our relations with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>.</p>
                    <p>There's a rumor that you feel we led you astray on the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> by painting a grim picture of its inability
                        to get food. I don't believe this, <pb n="476" xml:id="pg_476" facs="0508"/>because we put the case on straight political grounds of preventing a real
                        bust-up between the US and <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. Our chief
                        hope was to forestall total <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> dependence
                        on the Soviets for wheat as well as arms. We're still in this ballgame if we
                        choose.</p>
                    <p>New Problem. Releasing the $37 million has led to growing pressure on
                        Agriculture from the trade and its Hill friends to resume <gloss target="#t_CCC1">CCC</gloss> credit sales. We've been sitting on about
                        $30 million worth of applications for wheat, tobacco, barley, etc.
                        Agriculture is pressing to release these because they earn dollars and help
                        meet PL 480 usual marketings. It's also odd that we would give wheat under
                        Title I but not sell it for dollars.</p>
                    <p>In fact, however, the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> is so low on
                        foreign exchange and its credit so poor that it cannot get the needed US
                        bank guarantees to permit many (if any) dollar sales unless the <gloss target="#t_EXIM1">EXIM</gloss> Bank will reinsure these guarantees. Thus
                        by authorizing <gloss target="#t_CCC1">CCC</gloss> sales, but not allowing
                            <gloss target="#t_EXIM1">EXIM</gloss> reinsurance, we can have our cake
                        and eat it too—avoid trade and Hill criticism but still keep the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> on a short rein. I'd add that these small
                        dollar sales generate no adverse publicity. Is this OK?<note n="2" xml:id="d226fn2"> Johnson wrote at the bottom of the memorandum: “See

                        inquired at what level we would be making demarches to <gloss target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss>. Talbot replied it might be at more than
                        one level, normal contact with senior level of <gloss target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss> being our Ambassador.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> emphasized Israelis do not
                        believe what <gloss target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss> doing is foot-dragging.
                        Israel Minister <persName corresp="#p_GM4">Gazit</persName> reviewed Israeli
                        position stating <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> had refuted US
                        deprecation of Lebanese project by indicating both Lebanese and Syrian
                        sections of canal are on same contour and excavations near al-Meri are for
                        larger enterprise than mere roadshifting. He reiterated now is right time
                        from diplomatic point of view to push Lebanese into removing tractors, slow
                        foot-dragging down to standstill and create right atmosphere for gradual
                        shelving entire plan. <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> stated
                        there had been predisposition in <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> to
                        minimize Lebanese project while watching Syrians most closely. However
                            <gloss target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss>, even after <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> speech of May 31 and for reasons
                        Israel cannot fathom, continued at increased pace when it had excuse to
                        stop. Now Jerusalem is no longer predisposed minimize it.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> concluded that, while he would
                        report <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName>'s suggestion of
                        continued use of <gloss target="#t_ILMAC1">ILMAC</gloss> channel for this
                        purpose, <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> would still be appreciative of
                        US demarche to Lebanese stressing new element in Israeli concern over
                        situation. <persName corresp="#p_TPH2">Talbot</persName> replied we would
                        keep eye on situation and might have further conversation on it.</p>
                    <p>You should seek meeting with <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> to
                        speak along following lines:</p>
                    <p>1. We, as friends of Israel, are concerned at certain recent Israeli actions
                        vis-a-vis Arabs. We would have expected, during recent months as high tide
                        of Arab Summit solidarity receded and as Arab realists recognized once again
                        Israel's basic military preeminence, that <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> actions would be characterized more consistently by calm,
                        confidence and restraint expected of nation whose security is essentially,
                        if not absolutely, assured. However we have noted <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> on several occasions past six weeks has acted as if its
                        existence was in immediate jeopardy. <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
                        reaction late May to alleged Fatah raids was out of proportion to damage
                        those raids and appears to us ill-advised in that target nation was one that
                        seemed to be working curb terrorist activities. Erection of large burlap
                        screen on border by Israeli forces in Jerusalem early <pb n="478" xml:id="pg_478" facs="0510"/>July aroused fears and suspicions
                        unnecessarily. Finally <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> reaction to
                        Lebanese canal digging has in our view gone beyond justifiable
                        requirements.</p>
                    <p>2. Appears to us Israel may be losing opportunities inherent in present Arab
                        disarray. In current phase through which Arab world passing there may be
                        real opportunities make large strides toward peace and stability in Near
                        East. We hope Israelis will look beyond immediate desiderata (e.g. desire
                        achieve final collapse of presently feeble Arab water diversion efforts) to
                        longer-range goals of finding necessary pre-conditions for peace or
                        long-term modus vivendi in area.</p>
                    <p>3. <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> actions pointed to above also have
                        disadvantages in our view of detracting from Israel's image as country
                        sincerely devoted to peace with its neighbors and of making <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> efforts to help Israel more difficult and
                        reducing their chances of success.<note n="3" xml:id="d227fn3">

                    <p>261. I was summoned today from a lunch at the Australian Embassy attended by
                        the Ambassadors of France, Italy, UK to see the Foreign Min as soon as
                        possible. I began by thanking the Foreign Min <pb n="479" xml:id="pg_479" facs="0511"/>for a most pleasant dinner at his house the preceding
                        night. He said he regretted having to disturb me but that he wished to bring
                        on behalf of the President a matter to my attention that he assumed I had
                        already been informed about—the arrest of Mostafa Amin in Alexandria
                        yesterday. Reading from pencilled notes he then stated that an American
                        Embassy official, Mr. Bruce Odell had been lunching with Mr. Amin in what
                        was apparently a weekly lunch (I expressed great surprise at this point),
                        but that immediately on ascertaining the identity of Mr. Odell he had been
                        released although Mr. Amin was under arrest following a surveillance of many
                        weeks. The Minister stated that Mr. Amin had apparently for some time given
                        info to <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, some of it, as was done
                        yesterday, of a military and security nature. Mr. Amin had claimed to have a
                        personal continuing relationship of confidence with President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, a relationship which did not exist.
                        I stated that I had in fact heard of the incident but that my knowledge of
                        the facts was rather sketchy. I stated, however, that I was shocked at the
                        implications that he had apparently read into a routine lunch with Mr. Amin
                        who had a wide acquaintance among diplomats and Americans and had seen them
                        off and on over the years as I understood it. I said I rejected any idea
                        that there was anything improper in the lunch with Mr. Odell who happened to
                        be vacationing in Alexandria in recent days. I said also that the treatment
                        which had been accorded Mr. Odell had been considerably less than courteous
                        and customary when a diplomat was involved. He appeared surprised and asked
                        me to explain what I meant. I said that my conversation with Mr. Odell on
                        his return this morning had been extremely brief and that I would not want
                        to go into any detail on a matter with which I was not completely informed.
                        I then stated I assumed that he had told me the foregoing for my info and
                        that he would continue to investigate the matter as would I. I said that I
                        would hope that any matter of this seriousness would not be permitted to
                        become a major issue between the U.S. and the U.A.R. as I had worked for
                        many months to improve our relations and viewed with alarm any threat to our
                        friendship and cooperation. I said that the charges with respect to Mr.
                        Odell were most serious and that I found them impossible to believe or
                        accept. We paused for a moment and I then asked whether the fact he had seen
                        me today would be a matter of public record and what he intended to say to
                        the local press concerning our conversation. I said I was concerned because
                        the American press knew of the incident and I might have to make some
                        statement to them in the event he intended to make our conversation public.
                        He then stated he had no intention and, in fact, had not even thought of
                        making a statement. I said that in the event either he or I had to mention
                        the matter publicly I would hope that we could confine our comments to the
                        fact that he had informed me of the incident and that we were both looking
                        into the facts with care. He readily agreed and then stated <pb n="480" xml:id="pg_480" facs="0512"/>he did not know what President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s intentions were, but he implied
                        rather strongly that the President would not be pursuing the issue. During
                        the course of the conversation he remarked that if we wanted to know
                        anything about the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> I could always get a
                        straight and sometimes colorful answer from the President and that he, the
                        Minister, would always speak with me frankly and honestly. At this I replied
                        that I was grateful for the frankness and sincerity of the President's and
                        his own conversations with me and, in fact, was increasingly pleased with
                        the candor and warmth of the relationship between the Minister and me and I
                        would not want any incident to interfere with either that relationship or
                        the increasing friendship between our two countries. He readily agreed. In
                        parting I again stated my great shock at the incident and my concern over
                        the implications he had read into a routine lunch.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Comment</p>
                    <p>The conversation was very warm, very friendly and more in sorrow than in
                        anger. I am convinced that to the best of the Min's ability this matter will
                        be dropped although he appears to have some uncertainty as to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s intentions which will probably be
                        clear to us in his speeches in the next few days.</p>
                    <p>I think it is vital that this matter not be permitted to get out of hand and
                        that we be as restrained and relaxed as possible in dealing with the press.
                        Our earlier recommendation that we refer to the fact that an Embassy officer
                        was detained but that he was released when his identity was established is
                        by far the best line I can think of. I cannot get through the day without
                        having to take it with some of the press. If you have any different views,
                        send them to me as quickly as possible.</p>

                    <p>3) Hope meanwhile conduct U.S.-U.A.R. relations in low key, get them off

                        <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> said he thought <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s motive in citing US pressure was
                        to underline vital Egyptian interest in wheat. Crux is if US does not supply
                        food others will. Egypt has maintained non-aligned policy thus far, but
                        failure obtain US wheat would expose it to Communist domination. Important
                        that President understand that seriousness situation comparable to 1955
                        Aswan dam decision. <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> Ambassador at that

                        Egypt, Near East and perhaps Africa.</p>
                    <p>Secretary agreed consequences could be serious, but if <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> wished go to other side, little we could do
                        to stop it. <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> should not underestimate US
                        constitutional system and need to build coalitions of popular support behind
                        each governmental policy. We committed consult with Congress on new
                        agreement and impressions from Cairo important in shaping Congressional
                        attitudes. Speech by <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> thanking
                        Soviet Union for wheat, but failing mention $400 million worth US wheat
                        sales inevitably caused adverse domestic effect.</p>
                    <p>Secretary hoped, if matters kept quiet, it would be possible work out another
                        agreement. Important that both Cairo and Washington understand elements that
                        make action possible.</p>
                    <p>Later Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> expressed
                        satisfaction to Dept officer about results meeting. He said, however:</p>
                    <p>1) Important remove fear of famine from <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s mind. <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> must have
                        food; would prefer US as supplier, but will go anywhere to get it.</p>
                    <p>2) Since suspension PL–480 sales last January, <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> officials puzzled and perplexed by US attitude conducting
                        agonizing reappraisal US–<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> relations.</p>
                    <p>3) Important maintain and even accelerate tempo contacts with <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> officials during coming weeks to forestall
                        rash acceptance possible Communist wheat arrangement. Detente might lead to
                        discouragement.</p>
                    <p>4) Effort to improve climate US–<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> relations
                        must be joint endeavor along broad front in both Cairo and Washington.
                        Control of US secret activities not in best interests <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> important contribution. Many Egyptians feel

                        undermined.</p>
                    <p>5) While <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> aware of domestic

                        controlling domestic pressures. He suspects US reluctance move on wheat may
                        be plot to exploit vital <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> need as means
                        embarrass and overthrow him. Should he become convinced validity his

                    <p>Israeli Tanks. I have the honor to inform you that we finally closed the
                        Israeli tank sale on the original basis approved by you.<note n="2" xml:id="d230fn2">The agreement was embodied in a July 29 exchange of

                        they finally conceded and are very happy to boot.</p>
                    <p>They'll get (a) 110 M48A2C medium tanks to replace the German ones; (b) 100
                        M48A1 tanks to match those sold to Jordan; (c) conversion kits to upgun
                        these plus the 40 Bonn did deliver to 105 mm. guns; and (d) ammo and spares.
                        Total sale would amount to around $42 million in dollars over two years or
                        more. I might add that Israelis have been very good at keeping mum to date,
                        and we have a cancellation clause in case they leak later.</p>
                    <p>Now we'll start arguing about the twenty-four combat planes we said we'd help

                        is strong against any US sale so we'll stall for a while and try to shift
                        them to Europe. We can always concede in the end, but it's good to have
                        leverage on the Israelis because we don't like their threats to attack the
                        Arab water diversion works (now it's Lebanon). We're also still very
                        suspicious they might go nuclear.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DRP1">Davies</persName> provided the Ambassador
                        with that portion of the transcript of the Secretary's press conference of
                        August 2 which related to U.S.-U.A.R. relations. He noted that there was a
                        genuine desire for improved relations with the U.A.R. within the United
                        States government and that there was only one policy within the U.S.G. This
                        was recommended by the Secretary of State, approved by the President, and
                        was binding on all agencies and individual officials of the Government. The
                        exaggerated accounts of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> influence as
                        pedalled in such books as “The Invisible Government” should not be taken at
                        face value. The Ambassador in Cairo was the President's personal
                        representative and led a country team for whose actions he was directly
                        responsible. If the <gloss target="#t_UARG1">UARG</gloss> had any suspicions
                        that an agency or an individual was not acting in accord with our stated
                        policy, it should go to the Ambassador for reassurance. He would be pleased
                        at any time to investigate and satisfy any question the <gloss target="#t_UARG1">UARG</gloss> might have. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DRP1">Davies</persName> said he could state categorically
                        that no element of the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> was attempting to
                        subvert the <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> regime.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DRP1">Davies</persName> said the arrest of Mustafa
                        Amin and charges against him were cause for concern. Amin was known to favor
                        close U.S.-Egyptian relations, knew and saw many Americans, and had
                        conducted his contacts openly. It raised the problem touched on by Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_SHM1">Symmes</persName> earlier as to who spoke
                        for the U.A.R. We thought Amin reflected President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s views just as we think Hassanein
                        Haykal reflects them in his current talks with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BLD2">Battle</persName>. Will U.A.R. intelligence pick up
                        Haykal one day because of these contacts? Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BLD2">Battle</persName> has continually made clear to Haykal
                        that he cannot consider him an official channel. If the <gloss target="#t_UARG1">UARG</gloss>, however, wishes us to use an <pb n="487" xml:id="pg_487" facs="0519"/>Amin, Haykal or Sharaf as a channel of
                        communication, it should so indicate. However, we repose complete confidence
                        in our Ambassador and in the integrity and accuracy of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName>. We would prefer to accelerate the
                        dialogue between our governments through them to the Foreign Ministry and
                        Presidency.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> indicated his complete
                        accord with these views and said he would convey them with his endorsement
                        discreetly to President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DRP1">Davies</persName> noted that in January he
                        had expressed concern to the Ambassador over indications that the Soviets
                        were planting false intelligence with the <gloss target="#t_UARG1">UARG</gloss>. Almost intuitively he felt that this process was a fact
                        and that the Soviets were poisoning the well of U.S.-U.A.R. relations. He
                        had seen the Soviets in action in Iraq under Kassem and, although the <gloss target="#t_UARG1">UARG</gloss> was far more sophisticated, he felt the
                        Soviets were succeeding in creating suspicion. In January he had mentioned
                        specifically the Sudan where the Soviets sought to involve the U.S. in the
                        southern dissidents movements. He felt that allegations made both by the
                        Yemeni and the U.A.R. officials in Yemen that the U.S. was in fact
                        encouraging Saudi and Iranian help to the Royalists stemmed from Soviet
                        activities. Similarly, the alleged feeling in Cairo that the U.S. was
                        operating against the <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> regime
                        was stimulated by the Soviets. The U.S.G. was not in any way operating
                        against the U.A.R. and the record would show that we had consistently sought
                        to be helpful in facilitating a solution to the Yemen problem.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador said <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s departure
                        for Moscow August 28 could have dangerous consequences if <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> at that time felt that there was “no
                        hope for further U.S. PL 480 assistance.” He urged some kind of forward
                        motion on negotiations. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DRP1">Davies</persName>
                        replied that while the administration was anxious to improve relations he
                        would be less than frank if he led the Ambassador to believe that the
                        climate prevailing in the Congress would permit action leading to a new
                        agreement. This did not mean that an agreement would not be possible in the
                        future, provided some outstanding political differences could be resolved.
                        Until this improvement could be demonstrated, however, he could not see any
                        move toward new assistance.</p>

                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> praised highly the
                        August 9 televised interview with Secretaries <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> on
                        Viet-Nam. He had sent a summary of points made to his government, which was
                        extremely anxious to have full information on the U.S. position.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> said he sent a full
                        report of his last conversation with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DRP1">Davies</persName> to the Presidency. He had made the points concerning
                        the unity of U.S. policy and the need for the <gloss target="#t_UARG1">UARG</gloss> to discuss frankly <pb n="488" xml:id="pg_488" facs="0520"/>any suspicions it might have of U.S. intentions with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BLD2">Battle</persName>, the desirability of defining more
                        clearly the channels of communication between our governments, the U.S.
                        concerns over possible U.A.R. pressure on Saudi Arabia, and the U.S.G.
                        desire to see an improvement in relations. He had just received a reply on
                        the question of U.A.R.-Saudi relations. He was instructed to assure his
                        colleagues in the Department of the <gloss target="#t_UARG1">UARG</gloss>
                        desire to see peace restored in Yemen and for amicable relations with Saudi
                        Arabia. President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> had
                        dispatched Hassan Sabri al-Kholi to urge King Faisal to meet with President
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> in order to determine
                        conditions for peace in Yemen. As of the date of the telegram, Faisal had
                        not responded. The <gloss target="#t_UARG1">UARG</gloss> hoped that the U.S.
                        would use its influence in Jidda to encourage <persName corresp="#p_FAAAS1">Faisal</persName> to meet with the President. In the meantime, reports
                        of alleged U.A.R. intentions of attacks on Saudi Arabia were false.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador again raised the possibility of closer Soviet-U.A.R. relations
                        if <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> is not assured of U.S.
                        interest in the U.A.R.'s future. He said the PL 480 program had been the
                        basis on which U.S.-U.A.R. relations were conducted. The provision of
                        foodstuff in fact had enabled the U.A.R. to pursue a non-aligned policy. Its
                        termination could completely change the orientation of U.A.R. policy to the
                        disadvantage of the West.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DRP1">Davies</persName> said he could only repeat
                        that the climate in Congress toward aid to the U.A.R. precluded any steps in
                        this direction by the Administration. It was important first to clean up any
                        irregularities in the carrying out of the past agreements. The U.S.G.
                        position on this had been formulated and we would soon be discussing these
                        matters in Cairo. Before the Administration could even discuss the
                        possibility of a new agreement, it had to be protected from charges that it
                        had failed to ensure compliance with provisions of the old agreement. He saw
                        no possibility of assurances to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> of favorable consideration of a new agreement prior
                        to August 28. He would recommend to his superiors, however, prior to
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s departure, of an
                        indication to him of our desire to have a full scale review of our relations
                        either on his return from Moscow or on completion of the September Arab
                        Summit Meeting. Hopefully, during the course of this period the situation
                        would evolve so that the Yemen problem would be on its way to solution and
                        the complex of Israeli problems could be put back on ice. One disturbing
                        factor influencing Congressional attitudes was the U.A.R. press. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DRP1">Davies</persName>' impression was that it
                        was worse now than any time since November. He feared that the installation
                        of Khalid Muhyi al Din in a position of influence had permitted him to staff
                        most of the press with pro-Communists. The Ambassador interjected that he
                        was certain that the situation was not as bad as described and he was
                        certain that President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> was
                        giving these people enough rope <pb n="489" xml:id="pg_489" facs="0521"/>to
                        hang themselves. He again lamented the practice of Embassies of sending
                        summaries of unfavorable comment since the reporting itself distorted the
                        picture. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DRP1">Davies</persName> noted that U.A.R.
                        editorials and news stories were transmitted by the wire services and
                        provided the ammunition used by the Congressional opponents of policy. If
                        the <gloss target="#t_UARG1">UARG</gloss> wished an improvement in climate,
                        it would have to solve this problem.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DRP1">Davies</persName> said that a further black
                        cloud might be the situation in the Sudan. He noted allegations by the
                        pro-U.A.R. and pro-Communist press in Khartoum that the
                        “imperialists—U.S.-U.K.-Belgium-Israel and Tshombe” had promoted the
                        uprising in the south and had armed it. This was a canard. The U.S.G.
                        supported the integrity of Sudan and did not believe that the secession of
                        the south was in its or anyone else's interest. The brutal fact was that the
                        arms in the south were supplied by the courtesy of the U.A.R. and Algeria.
                        Some were siphoned off during the airlift to the Congo rebels and others
                        were taken from the Simba as they were forced out of the Congo by the
                        Nationalist army. Quite obviously unfriendly sources, most probably the
                        Soviets, were encouraging the Sudanese to use the U.S. as a scapegoat. The
                        fact that Soviet and U.A.R. propaganda coincided on this issue was indeed
                        disturbing.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> said he had been
                        following the news in al Ahram and had seen nothing of this and was certain
                        that this allegation would not be supported by his government.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador said he had a long letter from Kaissouni on the urgency for
                        the need of U.S. assistance. Although it was confidential, he would make
                        available a copy for the Department. He closed the conversation with renewed
                        appeal for action to assure continued U.S. economic support for the
                        U.A.R.</p>

                    <p>517. As the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>'s economic situation remains
                        difficult as result its foreign exchange position, our staunchest friends
                        here (such as <pb n="490" xml:id="pg_490" facs="0522"/>Kaissouny) are urging
                        us strongly give some early indication that new food agreement of some size
                        will be possible by end of year, assuming no major additional irritants in
                        our relations. They specifically urge that we do so before President
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> departs for Moscow August
                        27. I assume this timing impossible in view current status aid legislation
                        and climate Congressional opinion, but we must give <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> some fairly definite sign of our intentions by early
                        October because it must begin then to plan for additional wheat supplies
                        needed in January.</p>
                    <p>An affirmative decision will not guarantee a new honeymoon in US–<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> relations. It would be an important step
                        however in rebuilding our influence to the levels enjoyed in 1962–63 and in
                        protecting our essential interests in the area. We would envisage a series
                        of short term agreements for specific products beginning with tobacco. Wheat
                        in particular I would limit to amounts to be augmented by later agreements
                        in the light of prevailing relationships realistically appraised.</p>
                    <p>If our decision is negative or we continue to be evasive for many more
                        months, I am convinced we can expect progressive and fairly rapid decline in
                        our position here and substantial harm to some of our interests elsewhere in
                        area. I would expect the Embassy's effectiveness to be reduced to roughly
                        that of British at present, i.e., little useful contact with <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> authorities and little or no influence on
                        such matters as <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> policies on Palestine,
                        the Arabian Peninsula or Libya.</p>
                    <p>We have much to lose here in terms of a position of influence. We should take
                        hard look at realities of situation before permitting further decline in
                        Western influence at a critical time in this area.</p>
                    <p>In view importance decisions involved, believe I should return on
                        consultation at a time when Dept thinks my presence in Washington would be
                        most useful in reassessing and redefining US policy towards <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. As noted above, decision should be reached
                        by early October and as far as local factors concerned mid-September would
                        appear most suitable time for consultation.<note n="2" xml:id="d233fn2">Telegram 1126 to Cairo, August 20, authorized <persName corresp="#p_BLD2">Battle</persName> to plan to return for

                        <persName>Bundy</persName> said that following <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName>'s appeal (and <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName>'s own talk with the President on board the Sequoia) he
                        had discussed the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> problem with the
                        President. The President and the Secretary of State were going to undertake
                        a “careful review” of our relations with the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. More than this we couldn't say at the present time. As the
                        President himself had mentioned the previous evening, we wanted good
                        relations with key countries like the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>.
                        But these had to be founded solidly on mutual respect. Aside from saying how
                        hopeful we were about developments in Yemen, <persName>Bundy</persName> did
                        not go into any specifics.</p>
                    <p>In return he got an abbreviated version of the now famous <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> speech. The US had to provide food to
                        the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> to balance Soviet aid so that
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s “stabilizing influence
                        in the Middle East” would not disappear. Despite regrettable incidents, no
                        basic US interests in the Middle East had been harmed; the Israeli problem
                        was in the icebox, etc. But we were at a crucial crossroads. The diplomatic
                        corps here was full of rumors that the US was switching to a tough policy of
                        “tit for tat.” But this policy never worked. Great powers must be more
                        magnanimous and less emotional than small ones if they were to preserve
                        their vital interests, etc. For example, <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> felt humiliated by the way we had turned off aid.
                        Whether rightly or wrongly, <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
                        also thought <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> was trying to cause trouble
                        for him in Egypt.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> reminded <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> that he had dismissed the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> canard the previous evening and assured him that we too
                        sought friendly understanding. He was sure the Ambassador realized, however,
                        that this must be a two way street.</p>

                        United States supersonic fighters and/or light bombers. Its objective is as

                        memorandum of understanding we agreed to “ensure an opportunity for Israel
                        to purchase a certain number of combat aircraft, <pb n="493" xml:id="pg_493" facs="0525"/>if not from Western [European]<note n="2" xml:id="d236fn2">Brackets in the source text.</note> sources, then from the United
                        States.” (This was later understood to mean 24 aircraft, if provided by the
                        United States, to be delivered after December 31, 1966.) The agreement
                        emphasizes our policy need to avoid provision of offensive or sophisticated
                        weapons when these are available in Western Europe even if it is ultimately
                        necessary to provide a token quantity of United States aircraft. Israel is
                        seeking, however, to interpret the agreement as a commitment for United
                        States aircraft, regardless of European availabilities.</p>
                    <p>We do not wish to sell high-performance aircraft either to Israel or Jordan
                        because the provision of these highly sophisticated and clearly offensive
                        weapons would spell an end to our arms policy. Though tattered and torn,
                        this policy has been a major factor in keeping us out of the Near East arms
                        race and protecting the United States from the political damage that would
                        result from a policy of uncontrolled military sales. However, we have used
                        our facilitative services with the French and British for both countries,
                        and in the case of Israel we have also offered the French the use of a
                        U.S.-designed engine.</p>
                    <p>The next major Israeli push will take place during the visit by Air Force
                        General Ezer Weizman, scheduled to arrive in Washington October 11 to
                        request U.S. aircraft. Our basic position is that we have determined Israeli
                        aircraft needs can clearly be met from French or British sources. Therefore,
                        we will have discharged our commitment under the memorandum of understanding
                        by locating and assisting toward acquisition of suitable non-U.S. military
                        aircraft. We will continue to refuse to provide information on
                        characteristics and performance, price and availability of United States
                        aircraft inasmuch as we do not plan to provide such aircraft.</p>

                            the President recommended that he meet with Bell, <persName corresp="#p_BLD2">Battle</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> to review U.S.-<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>

                    <p>The issue is whether we now agree to start talking quietly about more PL 480
                        for the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. We'd come back at you in a
                        month or so before signing anything but even to start talking does imply
                        we'd go ahead.</p>
                    <p>All agree we should be much less generous than in the past, and keep Nasser
                        on a short rein. But State and our Ambassador argue cogently that some food
                        is useful insurance to keep this key Arab country from taking a strongly
                        anti-US course and becoming too dependent on the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and Red China. They're right on straight foreign policy
                        grounds—moreover, we've now faced <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> down and shown we're not to be trifled with. But if
                        we flatly cut him off (and he halfway believes we have), he'll have no
                        incentive to think twice about shafting us.</p>
                    <p>This leaves the domestic US reaction; how do we justify resumption of food?
                        After Yemen and the Congo there's a general impression now that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> is behaving more sensibly, and
                            <persName corresp="#p_BLD2">Battle</persName>'s recent Hill talks (he
                        didn't talk aid) lead him to believe that anti-Nasserism is far less acute.
                        So if you're agreeable in principle, I'd suggest the following scenario:</p>
                    <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_BLD2">Battle</persName> see Nasser, and say you'd
                        asked him to get <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s views on
                        the future of US/<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> relations. We get into
                        a political dialogue.</p>
                    <p>2. If this goes well, then State take such Hill soundings as are feasible
                        before Congress goes home.</p>
                    <p>3. Then we enter quiet negotiations in mid-October or so for only a six-month
                        agreement (with a six-month renewable clause) for under $50 million worth of
                        Title I wheat, etc. Anything beyond this he'd have to take in Title IV
                        dollar sales (which are good business for us). Thus <pb n="495" xml:id="pg_495" facs="0527"/>we'd be giving much less than in the last
                        three-year $400 million plus Title I agreement, and Nasser would know he was
                        on his good behavior.</p>

                    <p>Bulk of seventy-minute conversation devoted to exchange of comments on
                        position of President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>. <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName> drew parallel current
                        India-Pakistan crisis with Arab-Israel question, noting ominous lesson to be
                        drawn from an adversary's repetition year after year that “this country must
                        be destroyed.” She noted that despite well-publicized plans and budget
                        appropriations by Arab command for assault on Israel, nothing being done by
                        world community to head it off. <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>
                        took little comfort from <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s
                        Arab summit announcement that assault on Israel would be delayed four years.
                        She acknowledged that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> is
                        having a number of troubles, particularly stemming from frustrations of
                        Yemen adventure, but she warned that Egyptian Army, conscious <pb n="496" xml:id="pg_496" facs="0528"/>of having suffered defeat in Yemen, may try
                        to find someone else to fight.</p>
                    <p>Without stressing point she posed question whether it was wise for us to
                        facilitate food shipments to <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. She asked
                        that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> make <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> appreciate that his preparations against Israel are
                        something he cannot be allowed to execute. She noted that Israel was not the
                        only interested party in this question; other Arab states were concerned
                        lest <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> find ways of
                        strengthening his position. <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> made
                        repeated references to long-term dangerous effect, especially on young
                        people in Arab world from <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s
                        belligerent public speeches about Palestine.</p>
                    <p>Secretary noted that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> regards <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s influence in Arab world as more
                        moderate than <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> gives credit for. He
                        suggested that <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> posture toward Israel
                        more doctrinaire than activist. Secretary recalled that Nasser had exerted a
                        calming influence on Syria and in Jordan waters question. Secretary remarked
                        that in general we are not inclined to be optimistic about <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> performance but there was some
                        evidence restraint as, for example, in changed <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> behavior regarding supplies to Congo rebels, agitation
                        about Wheelus Base, relations with Saudi Arabia, and some responsiveness to
                        our representations on trade boycott.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> expressed thanks for <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> willingness receive IAF General Weizman.
                            <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> was highly satisfied, she said, at
                        our agreement that (1) IAF suffering “disbalance” and (2) US willing
                        consider supplying IAF needs if equipment not available elsewhere. Secretary
                        replied that we would be glad to talk to General Weizman and review this
                        problem thoroughly. He expressed frank hope that <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> aspirations re <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> as
                        supplier were based on differences in price and performance and not on
                        political advantage to be gained by Israel having <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> agree supply. <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>
                        assured Secretary that Israeli recourse to <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> being resorted to only after thorough exploration other
                        potential sources.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> gave Secretary list of “acts of
                        sabotage” allegedly committed by infiltrators coming from Jordan during
                        July, August and early Sept. <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> said
                        she knew King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> does not want
                        trouble but <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> considered Fattah problem as
                        very serious. Secretary told her we did not consider striking back at Jordan
                        as best way to deal with problem. <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>
                        emphasized that Israel had struck only at Fattah centers. Furthermore,
                            <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> provided Jordan Govt with
                        information about Fattah activities but lower echelons <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> were making trouble. She noted that Fattah
                        saboteurs who had been arrested were subsequently sent home by Jordan
                        officials without trial.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> raised question of Moqeiba Dam and
                        said it is not clear whether Jordan intended to stick to allocations
                        provided under Johnston Plan or whether some other diversion was intended.
                        She said we ought to tell King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> that Jordan cannot have all sweet water of Yarmuk,
                        Hasbani, and Banyas leaving only relatively brackish waters <pb n="497" xml:id="pg_497" facs="0529"/>to Israel. She said it would be helpful if
                            <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> could also inform Jordan that if
                        they intend to carry through Meifeidoun crossing of Litani River, Israel
                        position was that this would be inadmissible. Secretary made no commitment
                        to do so.</p>

                        been satisfactory to Arabs and that we hope they will agree to its

                    <p>The Foreign Minister cited the agreements entered into by the Lebanese
                        Government and by other Arab states. He stated that Lebanon stood by those
                        agreements. He went on to emphasize that the agreements were directed
                        largely to the use of waters arising in Lebanon. Syria, he said, was a
                        riparian of the lower Hasbani for only a few miles of the river's length.
                        Referring to other aspects of Syrian plans for water diversion, the Foreign
                        Minister explained that this part of the project had been stopped because
                        the projected canals in Syria came too close to the frontier of Israel.
                        Lebanon for its part, the Foreign Minister said, saw no use in going on with
                        canal construction to link up with Syria because there would be no canal on
                        the Syrian side for several years.</p>
                    <p>The Minister recalled that the Johnston Plan had allocated very little water
                        to Lebanon. He said that today Lebanon's own needs are such as to require
                        more accessible water within its borders. The Minister spoke of a 25-year
                        plan for development of the southern half of the country which would require
                        enormous quantities of water. He added that the city of Beirut would also
                        need some of the Litani River waters.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked the Foreign Minister what time factors the Minister had
                        in mind in contemplating the water development plans; he very much feared
                        that a first-class crisis was in prospect when the <pb n="499" xml:id="pg_499" facs="0531"/>take-off of water reached substantial
                        quantities. The Foreign Minister, without answering specifically, alluded to
                        a span of ten years. The Foreign Minister expressed the hope that the United
                        States would agree with Lebanon's view that a primary use of water should be
                        enjoyed by the people of the area adjacent to the water sources.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary responded that such would not be an altogether accurate
                        interpretation of our position because the United States in general supports
                        the Johnston scheme. The Secretary again emphasized that he saw the elements
                        of a major crisis in the Arab approach to water utilization. The Secretary
                        expressed the hope that the interested states would not rush ahead with
                        their plans without allowing time for the development of other ways to solve
                        the water problems. The Secretary noted that the quantities of water in
                        question were small in relation to the overall requirements of the
                        populations in the area.</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Minister responded that the Arab plans would take some time to
                        bring to realization, but he asked that we not lose sight of the fact that
                        Israel had gone ahead. Indeed, the Minister remarked, Israel was not using
                        water just for the basin in the area but was diverting important quantities
                        to the Negev. The Foreign Minister stated that Lebanon would insist on its
                        rights and was ready to take the risks involved.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary reiterated that he could see only trouble ahead as matters were
                        proceeding now. He emphasized the need for the United States and Lebanese
                        Governments to keep in touch, and he expressed the hope that there would be
                        an indefinite delay in any plan aimed at changing the basic structure of the
                        Johnston scheme.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked the Foreign Minister to consider frankly the question of
                        whether the true character of the problem was one of finding the most
                        efficient way to get the water or whether the objective was to devise a
                        method to keep Israel from getting it. The Foreign Minister replied that,
                        even though the question had been at the beginning a political one, it had
                        now become a real problem for Lebanon in the search for the water
                        requirements of its own population.</p>

                    <p>151. Fatah raids from Jordan were major topic discussion in Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName>'s courtesy call on
                        Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HRA2">Hare</persName> October 7.
                            <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> said Fatah raids are a
                        pressing security matter in Israel where the situation is becoming
                        increasingly difficult. Originally Israel had concentrated on the longer
                        range danger posed by <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> but this attitude
                        has changed since Fatah operations have acquired character of grave
                        regularity, central planning and expertise reminiscent of 1955–56. Fatah
                        striking deep into Israeli territory. People are unable sleep nights. Armed
                        forces are being diverted from essential training to night patrol duties and
                        wartime atmosphere created in border villages. <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> appreciates what US doing in Amman but worried and would
                        not like to draw practical deductions from its analysis of situation. It is
                        afraid King will not be able seize hold of situation. He should know Fatah
                        his enemy as well as Israel's. Important for him to take real action.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HRA2">Hare</persName> responded we
                        appreciate Israel's concern over this type penetration. We have been in
                        frequent touch with Jordanians, most recently with King on October 4 and 5
                        and Prime Minister on October 7. We convinced any doubts King may have had
                        about seriousness matter are dispelled. He came out October 4 publicly about
                        Fatah. Press conference by Prime Minister is to follow. Military are
                        alerted. Jordanians have arrested individuals although guiding apparatus
                        still intact. King has stated he is at wit's end to know what more he can
                        do. If Israel thinking in terms of retaliatory raid Israel should remember
                        King is not responsible but is trying to contain situation. Retaliatory raid
                        would hit Jordan not real offender and would favor those Arab elements who
                        want to accelerate long term animosity toward Israel. Raid would be grist
                        for Shuqairy's mill. US understands Israel's concern and is doing its best.
                        Jordan is also trying. Restraint on Israel's part necessary. Foregoing is
                        distillation of our most careful thought and collective thinking.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> responded Israel has
                        shown extraordinary patience due to desire give <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> time. But now appears Israeli restraint and a less
                        than active King have contributed to Fatah's feeding on its own success. The
                        King gives no sign of making all-out security <pb n="501" xml:id="pg_501" facs="0533"/>push and Jordanians in lower echelons including <gloss target="#t_IJMAC1">IJMAC</gloss> uncooperative. While Israel appreciates
                        US efforts with Jordan <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> is in vulnerable
                        position on this issue particularly in view of elections. Israel cannot take
                        too much more risk. King should not miscalculate Israel can indefinitely
                        ignore situation.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HRA2">Hare</persName> said we prepared if
                        Israel authorized convey to <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> seriousness
                        with which Israel regards situation. We would urge Israel take no action
                        that does not fit with progress we have made. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> replied he assumed we thought US
                        actions of October 4, 5 and 7 should be allowed time to have effect.
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HRA2">Hare</persName> agreed. Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> said he thought would be
                        helpful if US would reinforce its concern to Amman.</p>

                        is in Israeli and US interest King and other decision makers stay in power,
                        and 3) these decision makers have been back in Jordan only one week and
                        therefore need time to intensify control.</p>

                    <p>Since my return from consultation many of my diplomatic colleagues, including
                        representatives states not particularly friendly toward <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, such as British and Ethiopians,

                        serious economic difficulties, not to say chaos, if we do not do so. They
                        feel this would be tragic not only for Egyptian people but for Western
                        interests here and that best interest US and its allies served by our
                        keeping our hand in and maintaining position influence. They also believe

                        irritation and that installation new Muhieddin Cabinet, although done for

                        with aid.</p>

                        whom I have seen informally in recent days. Although not expressed in quite
                        those terms by them, they indicate belief Muhieddin Cabinet signals new era
                            US–<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> relations. This regard we are
                        impressed with pragmatic attitude new govt taking on economic and
                        administrative problems and its apparent intent concentrate on internal
                        matters. This not to say Egyptians have abandoned adventure, but rather it
                        looks to us as though <persName corresp="#p_MZ1">Muhieddin</persName> will
                        be considerably easier to live and cooperate with than Ali Sabri govt.</p>
                    <p>In these circumstances, and in view progress we have made on all matters we
                        have raised with Egyptians since last spring, I sincerely hope we can avoid
                        disappointing <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> now. Specifically, I hope
                        that when Secretary sees <persName corresp="#p_KAM2">Kaissouni</persName> on
                        October 12 he will be able give him definite offer PL 480 aid, preferably on

                        as favorable as those we have given such countries as Yugoslavia. I am fully
                        aware difficulties this may pose, but we estimate Egyptians have only enough
                        flour to last until January and no alternative <pb n="503" xml:id="pg_503" facs="0535"/>source supply in sight. In order avoid human suffering as
                        well as for sake Western position here, we should act now when we have
                        unusual opportunity to establish US–<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                        cooperation on new footing. Cannot emphasize too strongly my belief delay in

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">For the past nine months we have used a suspension of our
                            aid to press the U.A.R. toward policies and courses of action which
                            conform more closely to U.S. interests. We have met with some
                            success</hi>. Present U.A.R. attitudes toward the Congo, Yemen, Vietnam
                        and the Palestine question indicate an increased respect on <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s part for U.S. interests and a
                        heightened sense of his need to get along with the United States. In
                        addition, there has been encouraging recent progress on settling private
                        U.S. claims (reduced from $15 million to less than $5 million), and the
                        U.A.R. has promised to pay restitution for damages to U.S. property (our
                        library reopened October 3). A newly-installed cabinet offers hope that more
                            <pb n="504" xml:id="pg_504" facs="0536"/>resources and energy will be
                        directed toward economic development; the new Prime Minister (Muhyadin) is
                        believed more pro-Western than his predecessor (<persName corresp="#p_SA7">Ali Sabri</persName>).</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">We have derived all the benefits we can expect to get from
                            a continued suspension of aid</hi>. There is now risk that further
                        pressure, without a demonstration of willingness on our part to help with
                        the U.A.R.'s pressing food problems, will damage rather than promote our
                        policy objectives with the U.A.R. We estimate current food stocks will carry
                        the U.A.R. through the end of the year, perhaps a little beyond. With this
                        critical supply situation the time is fast approaching when <hi rend="italic">
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> will have to seek
                            alternative sources of food if he concludes that the U.S. does not
                            intend to resume its aid</hi>. In order to assure himself of such
                        alternative sources, he may be forced to make far-reaching political
                        decisions that will fundamentally alter U.S.-U.A.R. relations and throw him
                        into an unwanted dependence on the Communist states.</p>
                    <p>A resumption of PL–480 aid will not solve all our problems with the U.A.R. We
                        will continue to have policy differences. But <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, unlike many other Afro-Asian leaders, has
                        demonstrated some willingness and capability to adjust U.A.R. policies and
                        actions to accommodate us. <hi rend="italic"> PL–480 sales, granted on a
                            short-term basis and flexibly administered in terms of amounts, offer
                            the best means to maintain the leverage we need to contain and reduce
                            our differences.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>We therefore propose that we indicate to the U.A.R. that we are prepared to
                        enter into negotiations for a new short-term PL–480 agreement. <hi rend="italic">The conditions of the new agreement would be harder than
                            our previous agreement with the U.A.R.</hi> Two possible proposals are
                        outlined in the enclosure.<note n="3" xml:id="d243fn3">The enclosure,
                            unsigned and undated, is entitled “Range of Possible PL–480 Arrangements
                            With the U.A.R.” Proposal A was for a Title I agreement and a Title IV
                            agreement, each worth $70 million, both for 1 year but subject to review
                            after 6 months. Proposal B was for a 1-year Title IV agreement for $98
                            million, also subject to review after 6 months. <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> noted in the margin that he
                            preferred Proposal A.</note> Both would be for an agreement of not more
                        than one year duration. We believe any new agreement should reflect a shift
                        toward Title IV sales which are repayable in dollars. We would also
                        incorporate a provision for periodic review of the amounts being supplied so
                        as to give us flexibility for upward or downward revision depending on the
                        overall climate of U.S.-U.A.R. relations. There would also be a provision
                        for termination by either party.</p>
                    <p>A resumption of PL–480 sales on a short-term basis will satisfy our policy
                        requirements for the time being. <hi rend="italic">We would not recommend
                            any lending activities over and above this for the present.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>We need to come to a decision in principle about a new PL–480 agreement soon.
                            <hi rend="italic">We will begin to lose advantages when <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> gets the idea <pb n="505" xml:id="pg_505" facs="0537"/>we are trying to back him up against
                            his own supply deadline</hi> in order to squeeze further political
                        concessions from him. I am seeing the U.A.R. Deputy Prime Minister for
                        Economic and Financial Affairs on October 12. He leaves for Cairo the next
                        day. In my opinion the time is now right to proceed, and we will gain
                        maximum impact if I am able to indicate our willingness to enter
                        negotiations for a new agreement at this meeting. Detailed negotiating

                        the President wished him to know that PL 480 question was before the

                        480 arrangements had existed and that the President would not be able to
                        bring this matter to a conclusion while he is still in the hospital. I told

                        political issues with Egypt, which have improved in important ways, but
                        certain policy questions regarding PL 480 as a whole on which President
                        wishes to be clearer. For example, the policy of sending large quantities of
                        PL 480 food on extraordinarily generous terms to countries who are
                        themselves food exporters or to countries who use their own foreign exchange
                        to buy food in other markets needs clarification. My talk with <persName corresp="#p_KAM2">Kaissouni</persName> was friendly and, although he was
                        disappointed at not having an immediate yes, he recognized that he was not

                            who reiterated Israeli concern about Fatah. He said the Israeli
                            Government attributed the absence of incidents in the past fortnight to
                            the cycle of the moon and was apprehensive about what would happen when
                            the nights were dark again. The government believed the Jordanians were
                            not taking Fatah seriously enough and should “crack down hard.” He asked
                            that the U.S. Government convey this assessment to the Jordanians and
                            reiterate that it would be a grave miscalculation to think Israel could
                            take more terrorist raids. Telegram 164 instructed

                        Oct 19 making clear I was simply transmitting message and not endorsing
                        various points. Tell reacted with extreme irritation, saying he had about
                        reached limit of his patience in having “those people” tell him how to do
                        his job and not do anything themselves. Borders were joint responsibility
                        with both sides responsible for taking reasonable security measures. He
                        thought Jordan had commendable record of arrests and regardless of what was
                            <pb n="507" xml:id="pg_507" facs="0539"/>said about full moon, he felt
                        record of past three weeks indicated considerable progress had been made. He
                        had authorized us to pass factual information to <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> and this should convince them of <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> sincerity. What was Israel doing on its side to clear up
                        this activity?</p>
                    <p> Tell said we could report that it would also be grave miscalculation to
                        assume Jordan would not respond to another retaliatory raid. As for contact
                        between local commanders this could serve no useful purpose and was
                        obviously designed embarrass Jordan with other Arabs. To extent either army
                        encountered Fatah he assumed they would take action. Problem arose in those
                        areas where it was impossible fully to cover frontier. No direct contact
                        would obviate this problem and he had no intention of getting into position
                        where Israeli commander would try to control disposition of Jordanian
                        forces. Curfew also not feasible unless they able fully patrol area in
                        question and to extent they could do this curfew not necessary.</p>
                    <p>Re approaches to other governments, these had been most disappointing and
                        indicated no disposition to help. Trip of security officer to Kuwait
                        postponed since he too busy rounding up suspects but would be made later.
                        Contact with Syria so far only through local Embassy and indicated complete
                        disinterest. However Queen Mother would raise subject during her visit to
                        Damascus next week. This attitude on part of neighbors explained <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> inability to penetrate main apparatus which
                        was operating outside Jordan. He felt financial center probably Kuwait but
                        operating center Syria.</p>

                    <p>Planes for Israel. Now that Israel has a good tank sale under its belt (which
                        nets us dollars), it is predictably focussing on planes. You'll recall that
                        last March we promised that if Israel would lie low on Jordan arms, we'd
                        sell some tanks and “up to 24 combat aircraft” if they couldn't get them
                        anywhere else.</p>
                    <p>Again predictably, the Israelis have made a blue sky opening bid—not for just
                        24 but for 210 new fighter bombers. Their air chief of staff was just here
                        proposing in effect that we take over the modernization of the whole Israeli
                        air force, on the grounds that neither France nor the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>—the only other suppliers—can provide the planes.<note n="2" xml:id="d246fn2">Discussions held October 12–13 between an Israeli

                        produce far better aircraft for the money, and that France and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> probably can't meet Israel's total need (in

                        produced nothing).</p>
                    <p>We'll keep stalling the Israelis along, making clear that we simply can't
                        talk about becoming their chief suppliers but not slamming the door on a
                        small sale in 1966. State remains adamant against any combat aircraft, but
                        some of us are coming to wonder whether State doesn't overestimate the
                        adverse Arab reaction (as it did on Hawks and then tanks). Moreover, the
                        Israelis are eager enough that they'd even let us sell planes for dollars to
                        Jordan too (if necessary to block a <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>
                        deal).</p>
                    <p>Israel is happy enough about tanks and is asking enough other things from
                        us—a desalting plant, 1966 economic aid, PL 480—that we can play hard to get
                        on planes for a few months yet. But we'd recommend keeping the option open

                            October 11 memorandum. (Johnson Library, National Security File, Country
                            File, United Arab Republic, Vol. IV)</note> that we should try to put
                        together a food arrangement with Egypt combining four elements (1) the
                        procurement of rice from Egypt which we ourselves need in Viet Nam (2)
                        Egyptian purchases of agricultural products in the American market on the
                        usual commercial basis (3) dollar repayable food shipments under Title IV of
                        P.L. 480 and (4) food shipments under Title I repayable in local
                        currency.</p>
                    <p>The President was not asked to approve any particular mix of these four
                        elements. Nevertheless, it should be emphasized that the total package
                        should be one which is in our interest as well as in Egypt's interest—beyond
                        the mere proposition that what is good for Egypt is good for the United
                        States. We should not approach this particular combination in terms of how
                        best to put together a large subsidy to economic development in Egypt but
                        rather a reasonable, mutually beneficial combined transaction which will be
                        realistic in terms of our own abilities, Egyptian market operations in
                        foodstuffs (both export and import) and other elements affecting trade and
                        assistance in food itself.</p>

                    <p>1. Israel Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> called at
                        Department afternoon October 29 at request Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HRA2">Hare</persName> to discuss <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> cross-border raid into Lebanon. <persName corresp="#p_HRA2">Hare</persName> referred to <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_BW2">Barbour</persName>
                        conversation reftel and recalled <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> well
                        aware from numerous past talks of strong <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                        opposition to raids across <gloss target="#t_ADL1">ADL</gloss>. Said we see
                        retaliatory raids as disturbing rather than positive factor. First, they
                        disrupt armistice agreements. Hare noted that in <gloss target="#t_MAC1">MAC</gloss> context there is difference between identifying
                        transgression performed by Fatah or other thugs and official action for
                        which one side takes full credit. Second, <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> honestly and seriously believes such <gloss target="#t_IDF1">IDF</gloss> actions contrary to Israel's long-term
                        interests.</p>
                    <p>2. Re specifics October 28–29 raid, Hare made following points:</p>
                    <p>A. This amounts to triumph for Fatah. If irresponsibles by wrong doing can
                        provoke acknowledged action by responsible government that is feather in
                        their cap.</p>
                    <p>B. We understand there only three incursions from Lebanon in past five
                        months. After first one <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> expressed itself
                        as quite satisfied with <gloss target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss> cooperation in
                            <gloss target="#t_MAC1">MAC</gloss> and actions outside it to check
                        saboteurs. Therefore present raid does not have aura of understandable
                        action.</p>
                    <p>C. Also Lebanon is, after all, somewhat different in position and attitude
                        from other Israeli neighbors. Furthermore, present <gloss target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss> having its internal troubles and this raid could make
                        things difficult for it.</p>
                    <p>D. <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">Primin</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> in election speech only matter
                        of hours before raid had mentioned Fatah and Lebanon in sense of warning
                        them. Juxtaposition speech and raid just does not look good.</p>
                    <p>E. Finally, and <persName corresp="#p_HRA2">Hare</persName> termed this as
                        marginal consideration but one we felt should be mentioned and in fact had
                        been by <gloss target="#t_Amb1">Amb</gloss>. Barbour to Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName>, there are other matters <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
                        have talked about together. Things such as present raid can be bothersome to
                        atmosphere such discussions and certainly don't improve it.</p>
                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_HRA2">Hare</persName> emphasized he hoped <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> and <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> understand degree of <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                        concern this situation directly related to our concern for <pb n="511" xml:id="pg_511" facs="0543"/>Israel's basic security and welfare. Was
                        for this reason we felt it essential discuss situation with <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> without delay.</p>
                    <p>4. Responding, <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> outlined three
                        elements in <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> view situation. First,
                            <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> can acknowledge no difference at all
                        between type incursions from Lebanon and Israeli action of October 28/29.
                        Armistice agreement very explicit on this. It disapproves both irregular and
                        official incursions. Arabs must understand border crossing is two way
                        business. Said <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> hopes <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> will not press this point with it. If it
                        becomes point of public controversy Israeli border residents will endeavor
                        take law into own hands, and this <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> will
                        not allow. Second, Israel had noted October 27 incident took place despite
                            <gloss target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss> assurances after first two
                        incursions that forceful measures being taken against violators and despite
                        fact mukhtar of al-Huleh and other <gloss target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss>
                        officials could easily detect new Palestinian faces in village and draw
                        conclusion they were up to no good (since Palestinians do not normally live
                        and move close to border areas in Lebanon, unlike case in Jordan). Third and
                        “most serious,” there no connection with Israeli elections. <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> reaction would be identical November 3 or
                        any other post-election date. Main point this episode was that October 27
                        incursion was attack against occupied village. Israel cannot and will not
                        live this way, and <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> considers its
                        elementary duty is to enable its people go to sleep at night. <gloss target="#t_IDF1">IDF</gloss> cannot be spread thin and pinned down to
                        patrol every few yards along border. Either Arab Governments must take
                        responsibility controlling border violators or <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> must act as it does to provide security.</p>
                    <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> said <gloss target="#t_IDF1">IDF</gloss> personnel were given strict orders guard against human
                        casualties and to his knowledge no life had been lost nor a single shot
                        fired. He painted sober picture of mood pervading Israel's population. It
                        had lived 17 long years under Arab threats and bombast of every type. Every
                        family had some member in armed forces and constant cause worry about
                        personal and national security. Emphasis on military content Israel's
                        Independence Day parades was essential <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
                        tactic to assure populace its defenses at the ready. He knew of no country
                        anywhere whose citizens would take relaxed philosophical view of bombs
                        exploding under their homes. Concluded by hoping we would take all this into
                        account, and stressed that when <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> views
                        these matters from standpoint its own long-term security is convinced it
                        must act as it does. Present government has been as cautious as any
                        government could possibly be.</p>
                    <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_HRA2">Hare</persName> assured Ambassador we
                        minimized neither these factors nor wanton character of Fatah incursions,
                        but reiterated our strongly held belief that retaliatory raids not the
                        answer. Further, we were not pronouncing <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                        conclusion present raid connected with forthcoming elections though wanted
                        mention that facts of situation might lead some to such interpretation.</p>
                    <pb n="512" xml:id="pg_512" facs="0544"/>
                    <p>7. Israel Minister <persName corresp="#p_EE1">Evron</persName> sounded final
                        notes. Said <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> in other recent
                        speeches had promised exploit to limit all diplomatic and other peaceful
                        means achieve border security, using force only as last resort. His speeches
                        should be taken together, not separately. Urged we consider, on other hand,
                        King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>'s October 28 speech,
                        which <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> viewed as one of most belligerent
                        it had ever read and was itself flagrant violation of armistice
                        agreement.</p>

                    <p>1. Saying she had reserved most important point for last of several she
                        raised with me yesterday (reported separately), Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName> referred to U.S. public statement re
                        Israeli Lebanon exchanges over Fatah incursions.<note n="3" xml:id="d251fn3">Reference is apparently to a November 1 statement by the Department of
                            State, made in response to press inquiries about the Israeli retaliatory
                            raid of October 28–29 against Lebanon, which reads in part: “We deplore
                            the resort to force by any party whether by private groups or by
                            governments.” (Ibid., POL 32–1 ISR–LEB)</note> She described statement
                        as “a plague on both your houses” and reiterated complaint that we had not
                        singled out Fatah as cause of whole trouble. She said other govts had
                        diplomatically expressed opposition to Israeli raids but U.S. only one to do
                        so publicly. She went on to note two subsequent Jordanian Fatah incidents
                        (house at Givtat Yeshayahu and mining of railway) in which by miracle no one
                        had been hurt, and asked what we would suggest <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> do about them. She contended that evenhandedness of U.S.
                        statement on Lebanon had encouraged Fatah to latter incursions and that,
                        regardless whether Jordan and Lebanon trying to supress organization, U.S.
                        equating incursions with Israeli countermeasures tended make Fatah believe
                        U.S. sympathetic.</p>
                    <p>2. I said I had no suggestions other than increased police measures and use
                        established international machinery. I added continued Jordanian incidents
                        confirmed our view that <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> warning
                        reprisals not effective. I said further that such reprisals removed Israel
                        from status of injured party and made broad U.S. statements inevitable. She
                        replied that she not interested in being injured party, she did not wish to
                        be injured at all. She remarked that railway incident further instance of
                        lack of Jordanian cooperation in that Jordanians declined follow
                        investigation beyond border although detonator wires led forty yards into
                        Jordan.</p>
                    <p>3. Finally, she said <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>

                        today had asked her to call me in to make foregoing points. She described
                        him <pb n="515" xml:id="pg_515" facs="0547"/>as much disturbed by this
                        further Fatah activity and by the potential consequences of blowing up a

                        explosives.</p>

                        earliest that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> pleased accede to <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> request for new PL–480 agreement. <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>: In our view preferable you inform

                        aspects of new agreement would be clearly outlined to <persName corresp="#p_KAM2">Kaissouni</persName> and others and passed by them to
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>. On assumption <persName corresp="#p_KAM2">Kaissouni</persName> reaction to new proposals will be

                    <p>a. US–<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> relations suffered unfortunate
                        strains in past months, but we have noted indications lessened strain.</p>
                    <p>b. President Johnson appreciated President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s recent message expressing his desire for good

                    <p>c. We hope climate our relations will continue improve. Important, however,
                        that <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> understand problems we face in
                        marshalling domestic support essential for success our foreign policies, and
                        fact that future of PL–480 program will be directly related to climate
                            US–<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> relations. Believe continuing
                        frank exchanges offer best chance keeping incipient problems manageable.</p>
                    <p>d. Several weeks intensive discussion among interested <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> agencies were required develop program

                            <ref target="#d252">Document 252</ref>.</note> Have just completed 55
                        minute conversation President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>.
                        I conveyed President Johnson's pleasure at receipt <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s message and assured him US desire
                        reciprocate his hope for good relations. Made points in reftel re period of
                        strain, our desire for even relations and hope continue frank exchange of
                        views.</p>
                    <p>I then stated, as he was aware, US had taken decision offer P.L. 480
                        agreement. While terms do not include all <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> wanted, agreement reflects requirements world food
                        situation and US policies toward other recipients as well as <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. Discussed in some detail general problem
                        of food and then urged we look upon new agreement as major new beginning
                        between us and make every effort build on new foundation in the future. I
                        reviewed US problem of obtaining Congressional and public support for
                        foreign policies and stated our ability proceed directly related climate
                            US–<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> relations.</p>
                    <p>I suggested three areas concern. First, we should try to solve existing
                        problems. Second, we should anticipate new ones and try to prevent them from
                        arising. And, third, we must look for new areas of cooperation. In latter
                        category I mentioned population control and great problem we had in assuring
                        our food did not indirectly encourage population increase. President nodded
                        pleasantly but made no comment. I mentioned need for increasing food
                        production and again he made no comment. I expressed pleasure economic
                        planning and management under new government and noted with satisfaction new
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> attitude towards US business which
                        led us anticipate increased US business activity with cooperative attitude
                        and helpful approval <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>President then expressed his very great gratitude to the President of the
                        United States for the resumption of aid. He expressed great thanks to me for
                        my objectivity and help over recent months and stated <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> wanted very much maintain good relations
                        us. “We have nothing to gain from bad relations your country and we will do
                        everything possible to improve them.”</p>
                    <p>He stated he had wished include something in his speech tomorrow to National
                        Assembly expressing appreciation for new aid but would take my advice and
                        omit any reference even though he must deal with <pb n="518" xml:id="pg_518" facs="0550"/>Russian aid and had hoped for balance in statement. I
                        suggested he express gratitude for cooperation in past and pleasure at
                        improved relations between our two countries. He nodded and appeared to
                        agree do so.</p>
                    <p>I then turned to more difficult problems mentioning first Aden and my hope
                        that this area of contention could be diminished as source of concern to
                        those of us who wanted peaceful Middle East. I expressed hope <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> could normalize its relations with <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and would use its great influence bring about
                        cessation terrorism in Aden. I stated British committed to independence by
                        1968 and expressed doubt any other solution available before then that would
                        serve anyone's interest, including <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>'s.
                        Chaos would result from a precipitate British withdrawal and doubtful urban
                        elements who have <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> sympathies would
                        emerge victorious in that situation.</p>
                    <p>“What can we give the Front?” he asked. “They are not my agents.” I replied,
                        “I never said they were your agents, but your influence over them and in
                        area very great and your influence might be decisive in this delicate
                        situation.”</p>
                    <p>He ranted for a moment or two and I finally said, “What can you suggest that
                        is constructive in this situation?” He said, “Next move is up to the
                        British. We agreed to deal with Aden problem when Thomson came to Cairo and
                        this was impossible.” He then stated British efforts bring about solution in
                        London meetings totally unproductive but somewhere in this direction British
                        must move again. Assuming the Yemen problem is settled the key moment will
                        be toward end of Egyptian presence. As Egyptians withdraw leaders Liberation
                        Front will become deeply concerned removal Egyptian strength from area. Key
                        moment for British to make move is in three or four months assuming Yemen
                        agreement to be implemented.</p>
                    <p>I asked how President viewed chances Yemen agreement being implemented.</p>
                    <p>He replied that three or four days ago he had been pessimistic but things
                        looked somewhat better. Saudis wished proceed although were confusing things
                        by asking for understandings not in basic agreement, such as requiring 4/5
                        majority on votes at Harad conference when <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> had anticipated need for only a simple majority.
                        Nevertheless Saudis wanted settlement and he wanted settlement. The only
                        ones who did not were the Yemen Republicans. He said, “I am having as much
                        trouble with them as with the Royalists. I don't really care who is in
                        charge there as long as the Hamid ad-Din family is not involved. One group
                        is the same as the other to me except for the family. That was no real
                        revolution in Yemen. It was only a plot. But I just found that out lately.”
                        At this point I laughed uproariously and so did he.</p>
                    <p>I stated US strongly hoped for settlement Yemen question as it had for some
                        time. He stated he too wanted settlement and that issue <pb n="519" xml:id="pg_519" facs="0551"/>had been most difficult one for him. “Do
                        you know we have had over 70,000 troops there?” I replied that this was more
                        than I had estimated. He stated military had wanted him expand conflict to
                        Saudi Arabia and that just prior to talks in Alexandria (sic) troop strength
                        had been increased to between 70,000 and 75,000 men in anticipation expanded
                        war (although fewer there now). He stated he had held off military pressure
                        and had attempted political settlement against advice some of his top
                        advisers. Many of them had opposed his going Jidda (“but the world
                        applauded,” I said) and he had in brief conversation been able to do what
                        military could not have done through force—settled problem with King
                        Feisal.</p>
                    <p>President asked me to carry message to US that it must keep close touch
                        Feisal during this delicate period. Although every evidence Feisal wanted
                        agreement, we must do all possible keep anything from going wrong. I assured
                        him of our continuing interest and of our intention assist where we
                        could.</p>
                    <p>I then brought up arms control problem in general, stating world must find
                        solution arms race. I mentioned US hope <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                        could accept <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards, saying that
                        we were not, as he had previously stated, singling <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> out for attention in this field but that we had in fact
                        discussed question safeguards with a great many countries in hope of
                        encouraging general acceptance this requirement. He said, “I told Talbot our
                        position when you and he talked with me.” I said I was aware Egyptian
                        endorsement safeguards system but what was needed was formal adherence
                            <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards for its own country.
                        “Have the Israelis accepted?” he asked. “No, but someone has to begin and we
                        are in consultation with them with hope safeguards can become area wide.
                        Someone must begin this vital step.”</p>
                    <p>I then brought up conventional armaments and expressed hope we could over
                        coming months have searching exploration these problems. He said, “You
                        contribute to it by selling arms to Israel.” I said, “You contribute to it
                        in other ways but that is not for discussion this evening. The only things I
                        want to register are our continuing concern for the problem, our hope that
                        together we might find a solution, and our desire to continue discussions
                        with you on this very difficult problem.” He said, “How many tanks have the
                        Israelis obtained—300, 400, 500?” I said I did not know but I thought his
                        figures highly exaggerated but suggested we deal with basic issues and not
                        numbers any one specific armament. He said, “If you sell planes to Israel,
                        we will buy planes. If you sell tanks to Israel, we will buy tanks.”</p>
                    <p>I said this reinforced my argument we must find some way to call a halt to
                        resources going into unproductive activity at time they are desperately
                        needed for more important things involving human survival.</p>
                    <pb n="520" xml:id="pg_520" facs="0552"/>
                    <p>I stopped him from extreme emotionalism which built up very readily on this
                        issue, which I have not discussed with him for many months. (Perhaps a
                        detailed presentation should be prepared for my use with him in the near
                        future.)</p>
                    <p>In conclusion, he repeated again his deep gratitude for US willingness enter
                        into new agreement and his earnest desire to assist in improving relations
                        between us. I remarked rather delicately I would look forward to his speech
                        tomorrow night.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> The meeting was extremely cordial and

                            the response that the Department of State planned to make to a British

                                <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> demands, especially on

                    <p>1. French and British have made offers to sell supersonics to Jordan. From

                        ACTIVITIES</p>
                    <p>The frustrations of more than a million Arab refugees from Israel are leading
                        to new efforts, both peaceful and violent, dedicated to the “liberation” of
                        Palestine. Formation of the Palestine Liberation Organization is the latest
                        of several attempts to provide a political focus for the refugees, and it
                        has the nominal backing of the Arab League. At the same time, however, two
                        independent terrorist groups seem to be trying to trigger incidents which
                        would bring the Arab states into military action against Israel.</p>
                    <p>Jordanian King Husayn opposes either approach to eliminating Israeli rule
                        because his country is the Arab state most exposed to any Israeli reprisal.
                        Moreover, Jordan includes part of Palestine and is the haven for half of the
                        refugees, and Husayn is wary of pro-Nasir subversion among Jordan's
                        Palestinians. Syria, on the other hand, whose support of the terrorism
                        offers greater provocation to the Israelis, enjoys the advantage of being
                        more difficult to retaliate against.</p>
                    <p>Although Nasir, like Husayn, seems anxious to avoid any escalation of the
                        sporadic border incidents, these Palestine-Arab activities could, with
                        little advance notice, lead to the largest Arab-Israeli clashes since
                        Suez.</p>

                        feeling that US failed to “stand pat” on our original resolution. This
                        connection we believe we made clear from beginning that we considered our
                        text non-negotiable as to substance, but as Amb <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> told Comay Nov 5 “this did not mean we would not

                        to Israel to oppose all amendments as long as it tactically possible to do
                        so and to keep Israel closely advised of our moves. Willingness to consult
                        closely was not fully reciprocated by Israel and resulted in additional
                        tactical disadvantage for us as we approached vote in Committee.</p>
                    <pb n="524" xml:id="pg_524" facs="0556"/>
                    <p>2. Every step of way we have kept Israel's interest clearly in mind; this is
                        borne out in strong effort to block <gloss target="#t_PLO1">PLO</gloss>; in
                        forthright statement in Committee; in effort we have made to assure that
                        Committee approved res was cut back so much it bears little resemblance to
                        original. We have worked long and hard to obtain this result.</p>
                    <p>3. Our judgment of tactical situation is different from that of <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>. It is composed following elements: (a)
                        majority dels do not feel strongly about amendments; (b) there is among many
                        dels real measure of humanitarian concern about refugees which influences
                        their position; (c) many of Israel's usual friends (notably Italy) were
                        weak-kneed; (d) Arab amendments were approved in Committee; (e) even if
                        two-thirds not available for all amendments, two-thirds was there for many
                        of them, including some dangerous ones.</p>
                    <p>Our vote count tended to bear this out clearly, and we had no evidence to
                        support Israeli contention that there no need for compromise if we used our
                        full influence (this connection you will recall Amb Comay declined
                        invitation to compare vote counts). Clear choice was between accepting a few
                        non-substantive changes or running risk of res with number of really
                        troublesome amendments.</p>
                    <p>4. Given these tactical difficulties, we believe US del has conducted
                        negotiations skillfully and emerged with very satisfactory result. In
                        summary, del managed to (a) get Arabs to drop four or five references to
                        para 11; (b) knock out para approving Nine Points with all its serious
                        political implications; (c) eliminate call on PCC to report directly to
                            <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>; (d) change “without prejudice to
                        refugee rights …” to vaguer “without prejudice to para 11.” Only additional
                        element was acceptance of time limits on PCC report (which overdue
                        anyway).</p>
                    <p>5. As for resolution's effect on problem, we do not believe it makes any
                        essential change in situation. No new element has been added; some real and
                        potentially dangerous factors have been successfully beaten back:

                        positions including some of our own being eroded and elements of support
                        shifting.”</p>
                    <p>7. We fully understand Israel's disappointment that it not possible to make
                        some progress toward eroding para 11, and we regret some concessions (in

                    <p>8. But these tactical considerations aside, the main point is: we have over

                        for two and half hours discussion US-Syrian relations. Meeting had positive
                        accent. Makhus seemed to want lengthy exchange to give latitude for mutual
                        effort “to clear the air.” He obviously hopes US will ponder and understand
                            <gloss target="#t_SARG1">SARG</gloss>'s positions better; we hope Makhus
                        will use his political influence to get others in leadership group thinking
                        about better relations with US.</p>
                    <p>2) Amb commented on Baath's distorted concepts of US aims and policies,
                        laying special stress on regrettable fact that <gloss target="#t_SARG1">SARG</gloss>/Baath media have nothing but vitriol for US and fawning
                        praise for Commie camp. Referring to recent Baath theme that imperialism led
                        by US is plotting <gloss target="#t_SARG1">SARG</gloss> downfall, Amb
                        declared allegations of US involvement in such activities completely false
                        and requested Makhus to notify him if <gloss target="#t_SARG1">SARG</gloss>
                        ever had evidence it believed supported such suspicion. Amb also explained
                            <gloss target="#t_SARG1">SARG</gloss> very mistaken if it expects it can
                        kick US and at same time get US sympathy re Palestine and economic
                        cooperation.</p>
                    <p>3) Makhus made intense presentation of Baath's broad criticisms of US
                        Palestine policy and US use of its power vis-a-vis small countries.</p>
                    <p>4) He also kept probing lightly re US intentions toward Syria in economic
                        field. According to some quarters, Makhus stated, US A) is putting economic
                        pressure on Syria, B) will not make available to Syria significant
                        assistance, C) is keeping West Germany from moving ahead on Euphrates Dam
                        project. Main thrust of his comments was that <gloss target="#t_SARG1">SARG</gloss> would favor moving ahead on economic cooperation (memcon
                        by pouch).</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> In sum Makhus position seemed to be that

                        gone better than expected, and we've struck a pretty tough bargain. They've

                        Vietnam, increased commercial purchases in the US and a 75–25 split between
                        Titles I and IV. We also arranged to convert enough local currency to pay

                        that's going slowly because of bickering among the Yemenis themselves. The

                    <p>I've held off as long as I could bothering you with this year's Israeli aid
                        package. We have Israeli requests for $39 million in development loans
                        (nearly double the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>'64 and '65 levels) and
                        for two years of PL 480 Title I, starting with $34 million this year ($32m.
                            <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>'65, $23m. <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>'63 and '64). However, I see this as strictly a bargaining
                        position.</p>
                    <p>In economic terms there's no justification for either AID loans or Title I
                        food. Israel is doing far better than several other countries where <pb n="529" xml:id="pg_529" facs="0561"/>we've already shifted from
                        concessional AID and Title I terms to Ex-Im Bank and Title IV. Bell again
                        recommends we make that shift in Israel this year, and Mann agrees. They
                        argue that failure to do so soon in Israel undercuts the credibility of our
                        worldwide effort to get out of the aid business once a country is really
                        moving, and makes it tough to cut back in other places. Moreover, past Title
                        I programs have banked us excess Israeli currency, so Title IV dollar sales
                        would make more sense. In general, the harder the line we take the more
                        favorable the balance of payments effects.</p>
                    <p>Of course, State and AID recognize that the case for Israeli aid is basically
                        political, so each year they buck the decision to the White House. The
                        Israelis claim that economic need is not the real test; they have since 1959
                        regarded our aid, with some justice, as a defense subsidy in compensation
                        for our reluctance to give them grant military aid or a public defense
                        guarantee. Finally, there is the domestic political factor, especially at a
                        time when we are resuming food to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Nonetheless, I think that our Israeli relationship is in good enough shape to
                        sustain some cut in aid and stiffening of our loan terms. We are now selling
                        Israel hardware on concessional loan terms, which weakens its argument for a
                        defense subsidy. Moreover, on the horizon is our contribution to a nuclear
                        desalting plant (though this is more likely an <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 67 or 68 matter) and possibly some jets.</p>
                    <p>Our aid to Israel has averaged around $80 million per annum 1961–65. Last
                        year we gave $83.6 million ($20 million in <gloss target="#t_DL1">DL</gloss>, $4m. Ex-Im, $32m. in Title I and $27.6 million in a <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> credit for tanks). This year we'd all favor
                        cutting to about $65 million, but the big issue is over loan terms. I'd see
                        three basic choices:</p>
                    <p>A. The Bell/Mann hard line of shifting Israel to all Ex-Im loans ($20
                        million) and Title IV ($30 million), plus the $14.4 million in <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> credits already given. This would generate
                        a strong Israeli beef.</p>
                    <p>B. A soft line, essentially repeating last year's performance of $20 million
                            <gloss target="#t_DL1">DL</gloss> and $32 million in Title I. The
                        Israelis would probably be quite happy with this.</p>
                    <p>C. Splitting the difference by going for $10 million <gloss target="#t_DL1">DL</gloss> and $10 million Ex-Im, and insisting that Israel take
                        one-fourth of the $32 million PL 480 under Title IV (the same proportion as
                        for <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>). This option makes a
                        start toward shifting Israel on to harder terms, but cushions the
                        transition. It would generate plenty of Israeli complaints, but not too much
                        to live with so long as Israel sees hope for planes and desalting (State
                        will probably recommend shortly that we sell jets to Israel and Jordan—a
                        repeat of last winter's tank deal).</p>

                    <p>I'd favor this last as making the most political sense. I've also tried it
                        out on <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName>, who agrees that it's
                        the least we can do. We ought to put it hard to the Israelis as our best
                        offer, but could always retreat if they scream too loudly. Moving pronto on
                        this will also soften Israeli complaints about food for <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>.</p>

                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> said that during his
                        recent visit to Israel Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> and other senior Israeli officials had discussed <pb n="531" xml:id="pg_531" facs="0563"/>with him recent developments
                        affecting the area that were causing the Government of Israel serious
                        concern. In this connection the Prime Minister told him that he had to take
                        exception to the following erroneous concepts that were current abroad: (1)
                        Arab Summit meetings were becoming more moderate; (2) Israel is militarily
                        superior to the Arab States; and (3) Israel's Arab neighbors were rearming
                        merely to catch up with Israel.</p>
                    <p>As the Prime Minister saw things, the U.A.R. had been able to play on the
                        common Arab desire to destroy Israel and had succeeded in rallying the Arab
                        states behind the Unified Arab Command. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> then gave the Secretary the two
                        attached documents (“Liabilities Imposed by Arab Summits” and “Arab Summit
                            Budgets”)<note n="2" xml:id="d260fn2">The attachments are not
                            printed.</note> and read from them to show how the Arabs were busily
                        preparing themselves for the time when they would attack Israel. He dwelt at
                        some length on the <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> plans for the
                        rearmament of Jordan, Syria and Lebanon stating that their task would be to
                        pin down Israeli forces in the north while the U.A.R. mounted the main
                        attack. Once the refugees in the Gaza Strip were organized into an effective
                        Palestine Liberation Army <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
                        would have the option of letting them conduct Fedayeen-type operations or a
                        “liberation war” as a cover for his own aggressive designs.</p>
                    <p>The U.A.R. was giving top priority to its armament while cutting back on
                        economic and social programs. It had acquired 60 new <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>-21's, was getting 20–30 Sukhoi low-level attack planes,
                        additional TU–16 bombers and helicopters, and the first of a large number of
                        T–55 tanks had arrived. There was every indication that the U.A.R. was
                        organizing a third armored division and that some of the Yemen veterans
                        would be kept in the regular army rather than be placed on reserve status.
                        In this context the resumption of a food program for the U.A.R. was causing
                        Israel concern, particularly because the United States was apparently not
                        taking up with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> the things he
                        was doing to undermine Israel.</p>
                    <p>Although the United States had assured Israel that the primary purpose of the
                        Saudi armament deal was to provide that country with an adequate air defense
                        package, Israel could not gloss over the fact that the Saudis had an
                        airfield only 200 kilometers from Eilat and that the process of arming Saudi
                        Arabia would breed a new class of military in that country.</p>
                    <p>A second subject that was causing the Israelis concern was the status of
                        U.S.-Israeli understandings on Israel's defense needs. During the
                        discussions in March 1965, it had been agreed that Jordan had no <pb n="532" xml:id="pg_532" facs="0564"/>need for a military build-up but that it
                        would be preferable for Jordan to have Western rather than Soviet arms. The
                        United States had made good Israel's tank deficiencies and had recognized
                        that it would be in the interest of both countries for Israel to have modern
                        aircraft. The Israelis were disappointed that, despite this commitment and
                        Israel's repeated unsuccessful efforts to find planes in France, the United
                        States was unwilling to set a date for a resumption of aircraft talks. The
                        Prime Minister was under the impression that the United States would never
                        supply Israel with aircraft, even if it were demonstrated that there was no
                        alternative source.</p>
                    <p>Israel had welcomed American assurance that there would be no direct U.S. aid
                        to Jordan for its aircraft acquisitions. However, Israel had learned that
                        the United States was supplying Jordan with some 100 tanks beyond those
                        about which the United States had informed Israel, although the United
                        States had agreed to keep Israel informed of tank deliveries to Jordan. [On
                        August 21, 1965, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DRP1">Rodger P. Davies</persName>
                        informed Minister <persName corresp="#p_EE1">Evron</persName> that the U.S.
                        had supplied Jordan with 96 M–48 tanks under <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> in 1964–65 and would be selling Jordan 100 M–48's under a
                        special arrangement in 1966.]<note n="3" xml:id="d260fn3">Brackets in the
                            source text.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>Finally, the Israelis were disappointed that the United States had not
                        responded to their request for economic assistance. As far back as 1960 the
                        U.S. had told Israel that economic assistance to Israel would take into
                        consideration the latter's defense burden.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that he would have the Department study the assessment
                        presented by the Ambassador as well as past U.S.-Israeli military
                        discussions and would be in touch with him soon. With regard to economic
                        aid, the Secretary said that the Israeli request was under study. This would
                        have to take into account Israel's whole economic position.<note n="4" xml:id="d260fn4">Hare met with <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> on January 13 to respond to the points he had

                            of aircraft sales and that the Israeli request for economic assistance
                            was under high-level consideration. (National Archives and Records

                    <p>Our Israeli Affairs. Mike Feldman says he hopes to see you in the next few
                        days, probably to pass on a complaint about how poorly we're treating
                        Israel. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if you got a letter from <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> shortly.</p>
                    <p>Such gambits are part of a standard Israeli effort to put pressure on us for
                        more military and economic help. I've been through them before and, as I
                        wrote you,<note n="2" xml:id="d261fn2">A January 5 memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName> to the President noted several
                            items that <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName> attributed to an
                            Israeli effort to put public pressure on the United States for more aid.
                            He recommended telling the Israelis that “we simply refuse to do
                            business this way.” A note from <persName>Bundy</persName> on the
                            memorandum endorsed Komer's recommendation. Johnson wrote “See me” on
                            the memorandum. (Ibid., Country File, Israel, Vol. 5)
                                <persName>Bundy</persName> stated in the January 12 memorandum cited
                            in footnote 1 above that he had not done so because of the press of
                            other business.</note> the best response is to play a little hard to get
                        ourselves (and make clear we won't be muscled) before coming through. We end
                        up spending less this way. Thus we've held up informing Israel of your
                        economic aid decision just yet; we're also waiting till we can propose to
                        you a solution on planes for Jordan and Israel.</p>
                    <p>One development has infuriated the Israelis. To counter all the public
                        criticism they generated about US aid to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> and arms to other Arabs, somebody in the Pentagon
                        defensively leaked that the Israelis were secretly buying fancy missiles
                        from France. We haven't made them feel any better by pointing out that,
                        while we deplore the leak, it serves them right.</p>
                    <p>Although Israel will complain about a crisis of confidence, this is par for
                        the course. So is sending <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> and
                        Feinberg in to harry you. Thus, I'd see merit in telling <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> to pass back word that we naturally
                        bridle when Israel tells us how to run our business and that, if Israel
                        expects help from us, it must be a two-way street. We could well afford to
                        hold the line for another few weeks before easing up.</p>
                    <p>If you feel that we are trying to play too cozy a game, however, we can ease
                        up. We can short-circuit most Zionist criticism by leaking the tank deal to
                        Israel (even though this risks flak from Arabs, especially Nasser). We could
                        also go ahead with the economic aid package, and then with the planes. In
                        sum, we have more than enough goodies in <pb n="534" xml:id="pg_534" facs="0566"/>hand to stem any tide of criticism. <hi rend="italic">The

                        aircraft to Israel and Jordan along the lines of proposals in Enclosure 1:

                    <p>We have reviewed the options available to us in meeting Jordan's requirement
                        for supersonic military aircraft (Enclosure 2) and conclude we must agree to
                        sell up to 36 American aircraft if we are going to <pb n="535" xml:id="pg_535" facs="0567"/>preclude King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>'s accepting <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>'s
                        under pressure from the United Arab Command (<gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss>). The <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> has offered
                        Jordan Soviet <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>'s, but has allocated funds
                        to Jordan to purchase 36 aircraft from Western sources in lieu thereof.
                        Since the King feels he has already obtained the maximum numerical
                        concessions at the last Arab Summit (from 60 to 36 aircraft), we believe an
                        offer of less than 36 would not obviate the risk of his accepting <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>'s. In making our offer, however, we would
                        not relate it to the <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> requirements as
                        such. (Enclosure 3 is a chronology of developments leading up to the present
                        situation.)</p>
                    <p>This course is distasteful, but less so than the probable results of other
                        courses of action. We agree with Ambassador <persName>Barnes</persName>'
                        assessment that <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> cannot put
                        off a decision much beyond mid-January. <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>'s in Jordan could precipitate a chain of events that would
                        seriously damage our interests not only in Jordan but elsewhere in the Near
                        East. A subsidy for the purchase of more expensive French or British
                        aircraft would have balance of payments disadvantages and would put us in a
                        position of indirectly fueling the Near East arms race without the
                        compensating advantage of control we would gain from a U.S. sale.</p>
                    <p>We have been under considerable pressure from Israel to sell U.S. aircraft
                        regardless of what we may do for Jordan. If we sell to Jordan there would
                        have to be a compensating sale to Israel. Without the sale to Jordan we
                        might be able to stall the Israelis for a time. However, particularly if we
                        believe that eventually we must provide some aircraft to Israel, a sale now
                        to Jordan would have a number of advantages. It would protect the
                        considerable U.S. investment in that country, would enable us to exert
                        continued influence for stability in the area and, by preempting the Soviets
                        in Jordan, would prevent a major step toward an East-West polarization of
                        arms supply to the area. At the same time, an offer to sell to Israel would
                        make a sale to Jordan more acceptable to circles in which criticism of such
                        a sale could be expected. Our agreement to sell U.S. supersonics to Jordan,
                        to which we are convinced there is no feasible alternative, could be
                        incorporated in the same kind of Israel-Jordan package arrangement developed
                        for the ground equipment sales last March. (Enclosure 4 is a summary of U.S.
                        aircraft cost and availability data.)</p>
                    <p>We recognize that the course of action recommended will not put an end for
                        all time to either Jordanian or Israeli pressures on us for military sales
                        of supersonic aircraft and other military equipment. The threat of Soviet
                        equipment in Jordan will remain to be invoked in the future. Soviet supplies
                        to the U.A.R., Syria, and Iraq will create continued Israeli pressures for
                        deterrent equipment. Some sort of agreement with the U.S.S.R. would
                        therefore appear to offer the best hope of ultimately checking the arms race
                        in the Near East. The Soviets have been probed a number of times on this
                        subject, most recently by Secretary <pb n="536" xml:id="pg_536" facs="0568"/>
                        <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> on October 1, 1965, but our
                        efforts have not been fruitful (Enclosure 5). We are now studying
                        possibilities for a further effort to explore Soviet attitudes in this
                            regard.<note n="3" xml:id="d262fn3">
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> raised this subject with
                            Gromyko during an October 1 conversation in New York which covered a
                            number of subjects. He stated that he thought it might be possible to
                            reach an informal understanding to bring pressure on Israel and Egypt to
                            limit their arms buildup and that some day it might be possible for the
                            United States and the Soviet Union to jointly declare that they would
                            not tolerate the use of force to resolve disputes in the Near East.
                            Gromyko brought the conversation back to U.S.-Soviet efforts at arms
                            control. The relevant portion of the memorandum of conversation is

                    <p> Mac:</p>
                    <p>I am putting my talk today with Israeli Minister <persName corresp="#p_EE1">Evron</persName> in the form of a memo to you, because of the
                        sensitivity of the matters discussed.</p>
                    <p>He said that <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> will be leaving no
                        later than July. Evron either didn't know or wouldn't say who would replace
                            <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName>.</p>
                    <p>He also broached the question of an <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> visit this year. My first instinct was to counsel
                        waiting till 1967 but then I reflected that it's an election year and the
                        President might be interested. So I was noncommittal, except for saying that
                        a visit would be a lot easier if our other business had been satisfactorily
                        settled beforehand so that no one felt that <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> would be coming with a shopping list.</p>
                    <p>After I gently reproved <persName corresp="#p_EE1">Evron</persName> (who is
                        the soft salesman of the Israeli Embassy) for the press and pressure
                        campaign of recent vintage, we got down to cases. He thought that <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Golda Meir</persName>'s replacement by <pb n="537" xml:id="pg_537" facs="0569"/>
                        <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> would greatly decrease the
                        decibel level of Israeli diplomacy and make things easier all around.</p>
                    <p>On planes, I told him that Israel had made a grievous error in trying to take
                        a whole arm when we extended a hand. When we grudgingly said last March that
                        up to 24 planes might just be feasible as a bonus if none were available in
                        Europe, the Israeli response was the Weizman approach asking us in effect to
                        take over supply of the whole Israeli airforce—with an initial commitment of
                        210 planes. This had led us to draw right back into our shells. If they
                        wanted to increase the chance of a helpful response, I would advise them to
                        inform us officially as soon as possible (preferably before Eban got here)
                        that, while they still thought the Weizman proposal was the most sensible,
                        they now recognized our reluctance to become the prime Israeli airforce
                        supplier. Therefore, they would continue to seek primarily European sources.
                        However, they did have a much smaller requirement for low-level intruders
                        which they hoped we would supply. They should also tell us that they
                        recognized (as they had on tanks last year) the importance of forestalling
                        Soviet supply of aircraft to Jordan by a sale of our own. I could make no
                        promises as to whether an approach along these lines would unfreeze the
                        aircraft matter, but in my view it was the only promising way to get us to
                        take a second look. I also said that, were I an Israeli, I would not ask for
                        more than the 24 aircraft mentioned last March, and simply express hope that
                        we might later make a further sale of like magnitude. I think he got the
                        drift.</p>
                    <p>Then I pointed out that if Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName>
                        wanted to have a constructive visit, instead of being put on the defensive
                        about Israel's nuclear posture, it would be highly desirable to give us an
                        affirmative answer on the next Dimona inspection before <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> arrived. Otherwise, as Barbour had told
                            <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName>, this would be No. 1 on the
                        agenda of everyone to whom <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName>
                            spoke.<note n="2" xml:id="d263fn2">Barbour told <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> on January 18 that the most
                            important matter on the agenda was arranging the next U.S. visit to
                            Dimona. (Telegram 716 from Tel Aviv, January 19; National Archives and

                        <persName corresp="#p_EE1">Evron</persName> and I agreed that another
                        inspection was inevitable, and that it would be more sensible to agree on it
                        now than to go through the usual series of acrimonious high-level exchanges.
                        However, he pled <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>'s problem with
                        the new faces in his cabinet, plus <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>'s worries about <persName corresp="#p_PS9">Peres</persName>. These problems might force a brief delay, until
                            <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> could bring his cabinet
                        around. I replied that <persName corresp="#p_PS9">Peres</persName> should be
                        no problem since he and <gloss target="#t_BG1">BG</gloss> were the very ones
                        who originally set up the inspection arrangements. Nor could I help but feel
                        that renewed pleas about <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>'s
                        political difficulties were largely evasions. After all, we had just given
                        him a year's grace on these grounds. If, however, <pb n="538" xml:id="pg_538" facs="0570"/>
                        <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> did have a short-term political

                        month or so, and candidly explain why he asked for this brief delay.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_EE1">Evron</persName> advised that we keep a close eye
                        on Israel Galili, new Minister without portfolio from Mapai's coalition
                        partner Ahdut Avoda. <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> had wanted
                        to make him Defense Minister, and in <persName corresp="#p_EE1">Evron</persName>'s opinion he might well be the next <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_EE1">Evron</persName> asked about economic aid. I
                        indicated that this was a difficult decision for us, because of the
                        President's desire to cut back wherever possible in order to finance Vietnam
                        and the Great Society at the same time. Many in the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> argued strongly that Israel could not justify any economic
                        aid. But I hoped that, if the Israelis would relax, we might be able to come
                        at least part way toward them.</p>
                    <p>I deliberately took the above tack on planes and Dimona, because in my
                        judgment circumstances will probably demand that we end up selling some
                        aircraft to the Israelis. If so, it is far wiser for us to soften them up on
                        certain conditions precedent (on proliferation, on not making us prime
                        suppliers, and on not expecting too much economic aid) than to give way
                        piecemeal and end up getting less than otherwise. If I'm wrong, no harm has
                        been done.</p>

                    <p>Israeli Minister <persName corresp="#p_EE1">Evron</persName> came in briefly
                        at his request today to say that Jerusalem was most responsive to my private
                        suggestions of 21 January as to what ought to be done if Israel wanted to
                        maximize its chances of purchasing aircraft from the US.</p>
                    <p>However, they were worried about one particular point. What kind of planes
                        would we supply Jordan, if we felt that we had to go ahead with Jordan too?
                        I reminded him of Weizman's view, later <pb n="539" xml:id="pg_539" facs="0571"/>confirmed by <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName>,
                        that the Israelis would be most unhappy with the Mirage, somewhat less
                        unhappy with the Lightning, and least unhappy with F–104's. We had in fact
                        been holding off the Jordanians for a long time, as he undoubtedly knew. If
                        we decided that it was the way of wisdom (in Israel's interest even more
                        than ours) to meet <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>'s minimum
                        demands, we had in mind only a defensive interceptor-type aircraft. In fact,
                        we were thinking of some old F–104's which had a purely air defense
                        configuration. Therefore, I doubted that Israel would have cause for concern
                        on this score (I infer that Jerusalem was worried lest we sell Jordan the
                        same kind of plane we might sell Israel).</p>
                    <p>Jerusalem's only other worry, he said, was that if Israel reduced its request
                        to say 45 intruders (interestingly, the figure Feldman mentioned to the
                        President), would the US then consider this just a bargaining figure and
                        proceed to cut the number down even further. I replied that this would be in
                        the lap of the gods. But if we made a decision to sell aircraft, a number
                        like 45 did not seem to me unreasonable. I stressed, however, that we might
                        prefer to meet initially only the conditional commitment I had been
                        authorized to make last March, i.e. 24 aircraft on this sale; in this case I
                        saw a possibility that we would agree to Israel's coming back the following
                        year for an additional tranche of the same size (in saying this I had in
                        mind that State/Defense are recommending we sell 36 interceptors to Jordan,
                        though I favor only 24. If we do sell 36 we will be totally unable to hold
                        the Israelis to less than 48 or so).</p>
                    <p>I again emphasized to Evron that I was discussing this matter with them
                        privately and wholly ad referendum, in an effort to create the kind of
                        climate in which a US sale might just become possible. As he knew, however,
                        it would still be an uphill fight. So if Israel was eager for planes, an
                        approach along the lines I suggested would at least increase the prospects
                        of success.</p>
                    <p>I also told him that the President had agreed to see <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Abba Eban</persName>. He was delighted. I urged that if
                        the appointment was on the record <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName>
                        be most careful not to contribute to our difficulties, but say to the press
                        afterwards that aid to Egypt or Israel's arms need had not been discussed.
                        The visit should be billed as purely a courtesy call at which no requests
                        were made by him.<note n="2" xml:id="d264fn2">

                        Jordan. I understand that nearly all concerned within the Government are
                        unhappy about the proposed course of action, even those who are supporting
                        it. It is, of course, also unnecessary to point out the charge of
                        inconsistency that could be levelled at the United States in the event of
                        public disclosure of the aircraft sales in the light of the seventh point
                        (regarding regional arms races) in the President's message to the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>My preference, and I am sure this view is shared by Bill Foster, would be for
                        the United States to make further effort to hold the line on Near Eastern
                        arms., for I do not believe a convincing case has been made by Israel or
                        Jordan. Should, however, it not prove possible for us to forego the
                        implementation of the recommendations in the memorandum, <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> strongly supports the recommendation that
                        we make a concurrent approach at the highest level to the Soviet Union,
                        urging that a joint effort be made to halt the spiral in the Near East. I
                        would also urge that, concurrent with approval of the memorandum, you direct
                        the interested agencies and bureaus to develop on an urgent basis a proposed
                        U.S. program of action with respect to arms limitation in the Near East. For
                        various reasons past efforts to develop a program have languished and come
                        to naught. If we must go ahead with the present sale, we should make sure
                        that the time we buy is used to better effect in the future.</p>

                        Asst Secty <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName>:</p>
                    <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> noted US concern over refugee
                        debate, pointing out signs of diminishing support for US and Israeli
                        positions, citing restiveness of contributors, and stating we foresee even
                        more difficult problems this year than last. He expressed opinion ways must
                        be found to firm up support for weakening positions.</p>
                    <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> expressed appreciation for US
                        effort last year and agreed experience should be warning to us. He suggested
                        earlier planning and said <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> task force
                        will meet in February, develop its ideas by March, and would wish to confer
                        with Dept in spring. Early planning especially necessary, he said, to allow
                        time for full diplomatic efforts with other governments.</p>
                    <p>3. Ideally in future, <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> said, <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> should approach question on reasonable basis,
                        disposing of budgetary and other technical matters without rehearsing over
                        again in familiar terms whole political situation. Only way to achieve this
                        is to make debate less attractive to Arabs. He cited Arab-Israel border
                        situation and declared that since Arabs have learned they cannot have own
                        way they have stopped making trouble. He implied that similar measures in
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> could halt refugee debate.</p>
                    <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> also suggested PCC should
                        “intensify” its efforts, not by attempting any new initiatives, but simply
                        by going through motions and reporting that views of two sides far
                        apart.</p>
                    <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> agreed it useful try to
                        de-politicize refugee item and if possible omit it entirely from
                        proceedings, but doubted this feasible. He then went on to note issue at
                            <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> depends greatly on what goes on in
                        area, and asked if there not something Israel could do which would not only
                        help refugee problem, but also have favorable impact on debate. He cited
                        various ideas: Israeli contributions to <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss>; broader family reunion plan; and especially compensation
                        plan.</p>
                    <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> said Israeli efforts such as
                        agreeing to separate refugee question from overall settlement and
                        un-blocking bank accounts had <pb n="542" xml:id="pg_542" facs="0574"/>drawn
                        no response from Arabs, but admitted such gestures gave Israel tactical
                        advantage and agreed <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> would have look at

                    <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> noted US concern over
                        Rossides proposal. He expressed our understanding <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> opposition, but noted there not many negative noises
                        against plan when introduced last <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> then insisted strongly that
                        emphasis should not be on what Israel might do to improve position but “what
                        we can all do together” to line up <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> behind
                            <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> position. What can US do to hold
                        line or reinforce our position, he asked, and suggested time may have come
                        for <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> to state more explicitly its views
                        on resettlement as solution to problem as he claimed US did in early 1950's.
                        You should get others to say it with you, he said, and added it will be
                        shock, but we must confront Arabs with international opinion.</p>
                    <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> noted that <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> in early 1950's was very different and much
                        less difficult organization. He agreed however on need for early planning
                        and expressed gratification Israel recognized last <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> debate as warning.</p>
                    <p>10. <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> also expressed gratitude for
                        US position on Nine Points and rectification and <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> pointed out our friends and Israel's were very wobbly
                        on this.</p>
                    <p>11. <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> concluded discussion refugee
                        question by insisting that instead of making our position softer, we should
                        make it harder—on rectification of rolls, on solving 3rd generation problem
                        outside political context (i.e., without going into juridical status of
                        refugees), etc. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> noted <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> should work on “all our friends—not just
                        Africans.”</p>
                    <p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Planes for Israel and Jordan</hi>. We've held off the
                        meeting you wanted till the agencies could sort out this key matter first.
                        As you know, we've stalled Jordan from buying cut-rate <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>s for almost two years now, and stalled the
                        Israelis too for over a year. But King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> now pleads that he can't hold off Arab pressures any
                        longer; he may cave momentarily and buy <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>s. Israel is also getting hot under the collar. So we've finally
                        reached the point where we have to fish or cut bait.</p>
                    <p>There is no good solution, only another painful choice among evils. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and most of the key State people,
                        as well as <persName>Bundy</persName> and I, have come reluctantly to
                        conclude that controlled sales best serve the US interest. However,
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> quite rightly worries
                        lest we're accused of fuelling both sides of an arms race. He wants a
                        discussion before you first.</p>
                    <p>I. <hi rend="italic">The Argument Against</hi>. At first glance, we'd all
                        concede that the US should not get further enmeshed in another dilemma of
                        selling arms to both sides. Much better to get the Soviets and other
                        suppliers to agree that none of us will fuel an Arab/Israeli arms race. More
                        to the point of US domestic criticism, how can the US keep selling arms to
                        Arabs who are sworn to do in Israel? Given the way the United Arab Command
                        is calling for a joint anti-Israeli buildup, it looks as though this is
                        precisely what we're doing. This is the gist of the heavy Congressional—73
                        Congressmen just wrote <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>—mail we've
                        been getting (though what they are really saying is that if we sell to Arabs
                        why won't we sell to Israel too?).</p>
                    <p>II. The Facts of Life. In reality, do we have any better option than to back
                        our friends—Arab as well as Israeli—if we are to prevent a blowup in the
                        Near East? We have managed to prevent one ever since Suez by doing just
                        that, however superficially foolish it may seem.</p>
                    <p>A. <hi rend="italic">We didn't start the Near East competition</hi>—Soviets
                        did. And they've been forcing the pace ever since. Since 1955, <hi rend="italic">Moscow has shipped almost $2 billion in cut-rate arms to
                            the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, Syria, Iraq, and Yemen</hi>. We
                        and our European friends have been forced to respond by providing <pb n="544" xml:id="pg_544" facs="0576"/>some deterrent capability to Israel
                        and friendly Arabs, lest they become highly vulnerable. It is generally arms
                        imbalances (not balances) which most directly lead to trouble.</p>
                    <p>B. <hi rend="italic">Isn't arms control a better solution?</hi> Amen. The
                            US/<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> have tried for years to get a
                        Soviet response. But the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> sees much
                        more advantage in using its arms surplus to gain influence with the Arab
                        nationalists and to undermine the US/<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                        position. When <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> again raised the
                        question with Gromyko this October, we were again ignored. We've also been
                        at <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> and Israel, arguing against
                        the senseless waste of resources, but haven't gotten to first base. Over
                        time we may be able to reach some at least tacit understandings, but this
                        will depend largely on our first convincing the Soviets and <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> that they will not be allowed to create an
                        arms imbalance in the Near East.</p>
                    <p>C. <hi rend="italic">So maintaining an arms balance may be the best way of
                            moving toward arms controls, and of forestalling trouble in the
                            meantime</hi>. The Saudis really want arms, not against Israel, but to
                        protect themselves against <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
                        over Yemen. Tiny Jordan knows that it would be suicide to attack Israel, but
                            <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> (2/3 of whose people are
                        Palestinians) must appear to them as a good Arab and keep his army happy
                        (it's his base of power). We have no independent stake in Jordan; it has no
                        oil or bases. The main reason why we've spent some $500 million to keep
                        Jordan independent is to prevent the closing of a hostile Arab ring around
                        Israel. The Israelis themselves recognize that our subsidizing King
                            <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> is worth its weight in
                        gold to them, and play up US arms sales to Arabs mainly to get us to sell to
                        Israel as well.</p>
                    <p>III. <hi rend="italic">Should the US now sell combat planes to Israel?</hi>
                        We've come a long way over the past four years toward becoming one of
                        Israel's arms suppliers, and the net effect has been to help stabilize the
                        area, without creating as much Arab backlash as we'd feared. Indeed, it is
                        remarkable that we've managed all these years to be Israel's chief backer,
                        without it costing us our influence in the Arab world. This has been no mean
                        trick, and is still feasible if we don't get spooked by Arab, Israeli, or
                        uninformed US Zionist criticism.</p>
                    <p>From 1948–61 we managed to avoid becoming a major arms supplier by indirectly
                        subsidizing Israeli purchases in Europe. But the drying up of Israel's
                        regular European sources (they just don't produce the right items any
                        more—and Bonn opted out entirely) <hi rend="italic">forced us to become
                            direct suppliers</hi>—first Hawks and then tanks. Since our own deep
                        commitment to Israel's security would almost force us to intervene if there
                        were another major Arab-Israeli flareup, it is in our interest to help
                        Israel maintain a sufficient deterrent edge to warn off <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> and other eager beavers. And the
                        more secure Israel feels, the less likely it is to strike first, as at Suez.
                        So maintaining a reasonable Arab/Israeli arms balance helps limit the
                        chances of our being drawn into a Near East crisis.</p>
                    <pb n="545" xml:id="pg_545" facs="0577"/>
                    <p>A. <hi rend="italic">But does Israel really need US planes?</hi> Not as much
                        as it did tanks, but it has a good case. Soviet <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>s and bombers are still flowing to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and Syria. We committed ourselves last year
                        to help out with “up to 24 combat aircraft”, if they were not available in
                        Europe. If we want to be legalistic, we can argue that French Mirage
                        interceptors are unavailable, but the Israelis want and can best use an
                        intruder-type.</p>
                    <p>B. <hi rend="italic">Will selling planes to Israel spook the Arabs?</hi> Our
                        Arab experts so warned before we sold Hawks in 1962, then again before we
                        sold tanks. But actual experience shows far less reaction than we feared.
                        Unless revealing the tank deal creates unforeseen Arab troubles, it's a good
                        bet that quiet, limited aircraft supply to Israel will not upset our
                        applecart in the Arab world.</p>
                    <p>C. <hi rend="italic">Can we use planes as a lever to keep Israel from going
                            nuclear?</hi> Desperation is what would most likely drive Israel to this
                        choice, should it come to feel that the conventional balance was turning
                        against it. So judicious US arms supply, aimed at maintaining a deterrent
                        balance, is as good an inhibitor as we've got.</p>
                    <p>D. In the last analysis, can we avoid selling planes to Israel sooner or
                        later? Given continued Soviet shipments to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and Syria—which are Israel's real worry—Hill and other
                        pressure is growing to the point where we probably won't have a defensible
                        case much longer. We could argue that we won't sell planes to either Israel
                        or the Arabs, but does this stand up when (1) the Soviets keep shovelling
                        arms to the wrong Arabs; (2) we've already sold Israel tanks and missiles so
                        why not planes; and (3) it is our friends, not our enemies who will suffer
                        if we refuse to sell arms. Moreover, the more Hill and Zionist criticism we
                        get, the more it interferes with our ability to carry out a sensible Arab
                        policy. So if we're going to be badgered into selling planes anyway sooner
                        or later, we can gain more and will risk less by doing so now when we can
                        drive a hard bargain.</p>
                    <p>IV. <hi rend="italic">Should we sell to Jordan too?</hi> If we refuse planes
                        to Israel, we can't get away with Jordan sales without a storm of domestic
                        US protest. But if we deny Hussein's request he may feel compelled to risk
                        our wrath by caving to <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> demands that he
                        buy <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>s (in which case the Israelis would
                        have an additional powerful argument for getting us to sell them planes).
                        The only way to stop him would be to tell him flatly that if he bought
                        Soviet planes we'd cut off his annual $50 million subsidy. Some of us think
                            <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> would back down. But
                        should we take the risk? <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>'s
                        ability to stay on his uneasy throne depends critically on his not appearing
                        to be a US or Israeli stooge (his grandfather was assassinated for this
                        reason). We've already stalled <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> to the point of no return—in his judgment and that
                        of our Ambassador. Jordan's independence is important enough to us, and to
                        Israel, that we should not risk jeopardizing it short of over-riding
                        reasons.</p>

                    <p>Thus there is a compelling case for selling planes to Jordan as well as
                        Israel. In fact, the basic rationale is to protect Israel itself. Entry of
                        Soviet arms into Jordan would start a trend which could seriously upset the
                        Arab-Israeli arms balance, and put us under great Israeli pressure. As with
                        tanks last year, if we sell to one the same logic suggests we sell to both.
                        Otherwise, it's hard to avoid an even worse box.</p>
                    <p>V. <hi rend="italic">Conclusions</hi>. In sum, painful as it is, there seems
                        no better option than minimum, carefully controlled plane sales to both.
                        Selling to neither is not a real option if the facts of life will probably
                        force us to sell to Israel sooner or later. So there's advantage in doing so
                        now when we can get Israel to acquiesce in our helping Jordan too. The one
                        real issue is whether such sales would over-expose us to criticism for
                        “fuelling both sides of an arms race”. But most of this heat (especially on
                        the Hill) is from those who really object to our arming only Arabs and not
                        Israelis. We might be able to cope with this problem by requiring the
                        Israelis themselves quietly to warn off their Hill lobbyists. This wouldn't
                        be foolproof, but should reduce the flak to tolerable limits.</p>
                    <p>To meet the argument that we ought to be promoting arms control instead of
                        arms races, we could refer to our frequent efforts to do just this—and
                        protect our flank by yet another Soviet probe (via <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>). However, none of your
                        Sovietologists believe the Soviets will bite.</p>
                    <p>If we decide to sell Israel aircraft, we can only get what we want in return
                        by providing a low-level intruder. There's no point in offering an
                        interceptor if Israel doesn't want one (and could buy from France if it
                        did). It wants the fancy A–6 (at least $62 million for 24 stripped down
                        versions), but we could probably get it to settle for the smaller, cheaper
                        A–4E (around $24 million for same number).</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">VI. Recommendations</hi>. Offer Israel now (on the same
                            <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> credit terms as tanks) up to 24
                        intruder-type aircraft, with an option to purchase 24 more next year,
                        provided that Israel will in return: (1) continue buying most of its
                        aircraft in Europe so we don't become prime supplier—thus outraging the
                        Arabs; (2) actively, if quietly, support controlled US arms sales to Jordan
                        as being in Israel's interest just as much as ours; (3) not use our aircraft
                        as nuclear weapons carriers; (4) maintain full secrecy till we decide when
                        and how to publicize all such arms deals.</p>
                    <p>Offer Jordan up to 36 F–104 A/B's (a secondhand interceptor) or F–5s in
                        increments of 12 per year delivered beginning in 1968 for cash on the line,
                        if Jordan will in return: (1) purchase no Soviet equipment of any kind; (2)
                        keep the deal secret till we decide to publicize; (3) keep mum about US
                        sales to Israel; (4) renew its undertaking not to increase its own arms
                        budget at the expense of our own budget support program.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>The President warmly congratulated <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName>
                        on his assumption of the Foreign Ministry. He recalled their friendly
                        association when <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> was Ambassador
                        in Washington, and looked forward to a close future relationship.</p>
                    <p>The President then discussed at length our current position on Vietnam in the
                        light of the Honolulu meeting. He made clear that in helping the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> we were showing how we would live up to our
                            <pb n="548" xml:id="pg_548" facs="0580"/>commitments to small countries
                        as well as large. Israel would rightly be the first to be frightened if the
                        U.S. were to “cut and run in Vietnam.”</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> strongly agreed, saying that
                        small states like Israel had an obligation to stay strong and stable enough
                        that they would not become Vietnams, and thus create special problems for
                        the United States. He went on to say that if it were not for Israel's
                        security problem—created primarily by Soviet arms—Israel would no longer
                        need U.S. aid.</p>
                    <p>Because of its special situation, however, Israel still hoped it could rely
                        on the United States. Eban then raised Israel's current concerns over
                        aircraft, 1966 economic and food assistance, and the desalting matter. He
                        hoped that some of these matters would come to a head soon. He emphasized
                        that Israel would still place the bulk of its arms orders in Europe. But
                        sometimes it had needs which the Europeans could not meet, as in the case of
                        intruder-type aircraft. Israel needed about 45 of these. In asking for them,
                        Israel was not “changing gears” and trying to make the U.S. its chief arms
                        or plane supplier.</p>
                    <p>On economic aid, <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> cited Israel's
                        pride in its economic progress; it only needed aid because of its security
                        burden. He noted that all this aid was on a loan basis. As to desalting,
                            <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> reminded the President of the
                        latter's own great interest in the matter. However, all that Israel was
                        suggesting for the moment was the procedural step of appointing one
                        high-level official from each Government to look at the tricky financial
                        problems of how to finance the nuclear desalting plant.</p>
                    <p>The President assured <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> that we
                        would try to evolve something satisfactory on these scores. He wanted to do
                        everything he reasonably could for Israel. In fact we didn't even want to
                        subsidize Jordan, except that this helped Israel. We had no desire to be
                        arms salesman to Israel either, but he didn't want the Israelis to feel
                        insecure. It might be that a balance of arms was after all the best way to
                        avoid unrest in the area. We would also look at economic aid. The President
                        added that he was as anxious as the Israelis on the desalting matter.
                        However, he had been up to his ears on Vietnam and with the new Congress. He
                        would try, nonetheless, to come up with specifics shortly.</p>
                    <p>The President concluded by telling Eban that he looked forward to very close
                        relations with him personally, and with Israel. He wanted to do everything
                        he could, consistent with our national interest. “Let's deal frankly and
                        freely with each other on top of the table” and keep from batting issues
                        around in the newspapers. He added that we always seemed to have a problem
                        with well-meaning friends of Israel who attempted to help our relations
                        along. He asked <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> to tell them “to
                        stop coming in the back door, or writing, or sending telegrams, or talking
                        to the newspapers.” We and the Israeli Government together could handle
                        these matters. The President said he had great confidence in Prime Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> and saw nothing that was
                        going to disturb our relations.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> replied that his Prime Minister
                        had had complete trust in the President ever since their meeting in June
                        1964; he heartily reciprocated the President's sentiments. The President
                        then took the Foreign Minister out to be photographed by the press.</p>

                    <p>After telling Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName>
                        that the President wanted to reach an early decision on Israel's aircraft
                        and economic aid requests, the Secretary said that the only major question
                        that could have a disastrous effect on U.S.-Israeli relations was Israel's
                        attitude on proliferation. Israel was apparently following a policy designed
                        to create ambiguity in the Arab world. This also created ambiguity in
                        Washington. Israel should expect the U.S. to be extremely clear and utterly
                        harsh on the matter of non-proliferation. He urged the Foreign Minister not
                        to underestimate the total involvement of U.S.-Israel relations in this
                        matter.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> said he understood the
                        importance of this question and that the two countries need not fall apart
                        on this. The Government of Israel stood by Prime Minister Ben-Gurion's
                        undertaking in 1961 for periodic visits. The subject had become much more
                        difficult over the last year because of publicity and because Israel had
                        undertaken to <pb n="550" xml:id="pg_550" facs="0582"/>accept these visits
                        without full consultation of Parliament. There were delicate but not
                        insuperable internal domestic complications involved. Censorship with a
                        questionable legal basis had been imposed to prevent discussion on the
                        merits of U.S. visits. A full parliamentary debate on the matter had been
                        asked by an opposition party. This could probably be avoided. The
                        alternatives were to have a secret visit or one after the matter had been
                        discussed with the various political parties.</p>
                    <p>With regard to <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards, Israel
                        preferred a bilateral arrangement because of the increasingly weak position
                        of Israel in the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> and the growing
                        strength of the Arabs in that body. The Foreign Minister said that his
                        Government attached full weight to the undertaking given to Governor
                            <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> that Israel would not be
                        the first to introduce nuclear weapons into the Arab-Israel area.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary observed that this undertaking might not prevent the
                        development of a precarious situation somewhat akin to eight months of
                        pregnancy. He stressed that the U.S. could not be silent on its attitude
                        toward proliferation. With regard to visits, he said that the request for
                        secrecy assurances would have to be looked into. What he was interested in
                        was something that would serve as a public assurance. Private assurances
                        were of limited value.</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Minister said that as soon as he got back to Israel he would help
                        in lobbying for a U.S. visit and would also turn his attention to the matter
                        of <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards.</p>

                    <p>1. Plane Sales to Israel/Jordan. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> described the proposal being recommended, i.e., sale of
                        48 aircraft to Israel. He saw dangers even in selling the A–4E, but much
                        stronger political as well as military arguments against selling the A–6
                        which the Israelis now wanted. There was also the nuclear angle. At the same
                        time, it was proposed that we offer Jordan 36 F–104s or F–5s. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> felt that we could not
                        even consider the A–6. It was an extremely complicated aircraft, and the
                        bugs hadn't even been worked out yet. We had only one squadron. There were
                        security problems with its electronics. Its price was four times as
                        expensive as the A–4E. There was a shortage in our own supply for Vietnam.
                        Selling the A–6 would also inflame the Middle East arms race, in particular
                        scaring the Arabs about Israeli nuclear capabilities, since it was designed
                        as a nuclear weapons carrier.</p>
                    <p>The President asked Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> to take on the job of dealing with the Israelis on
                        this matter. He noted the pressure he was under from the Congress on Israeli
                        matters. He had already had to talk with twelve Congressmen, plus Foreign
                        Minister <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName>. So <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> should call <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> back here and tell him we couldn't
                        possibly sell A–6s, for the reasons <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> had given. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> should find out if Israel was willing to have us
                        sell to Jordan. He should tell the Israelis that we would sell them “X”
                        aircraft and give them “X” dollars in aid if they would sew up everyone in
                        Congress to keep quiet about our Jordan and Israeli sales. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> should say that our proposition
                        was a final one; all the pressure in the world would not change it.</p>
                    <p>2. After a brief discussion of economic aid to Israel, the President agreed
                        that perhaps it was better to hold off telling the Israelis how much
                        economic aid we could give in 1966 until we settle the plane matter.</p>
                    <p>3. On desalting, Bell and <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                        suggested that we should not help the Israelis on any plant that was
                        uneconomic. We should help out with loans at the normal rate for the
                        investment required, but there should be no subsidies. As to the Israeli
                        proposal for creating a two-man committee, the President agreed that we
                        should work out first what we could do financially on the project before we
                        agreed to set up such a committee.</p>

                    <p>After the usual amenities, the Secretary opened the meeting by saying the US
                        is operating in the Middle East “on very slender margins” and that there are
                        accordingly several things we definitely cannot do: (1) we cannot be a major
                        arms supplier to Israel or any Arab country; (2) we cannot sell to any
                        country a sophisticated airplane like the A–6; and (3) we cannot sell
                        supersonics of any kind to Jordan unless Israel concurs in the sale and
                        effectively supports it among its friends in the United States, both in and
                        outside of Congress. He stressed the point that, in the absence of Israeli
                        concurrence and support, the US would not sell aircraft to Jordan.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that, if Israel can meet that basic condition and certain
                        others, the US is prepared to sell Israel 24 A–4Es and to give it an option
                        to buy an additional 24, either now or later. The Secretary said the cost of
                        such airplanes would be approximately $26 million for 24 and that credit
                        terms would be the same as those which governed the Hawk purchase (10% down;
                        3–1/2% interest; and a 10-year repayment). He said that four additional
                        conditions would attach to our willingness to make this sale: (1) that
                        Israel agree to continue to look to Europe for the bulk of its aircraft
                        requirements and not regard the US as a major arms supplier; (2) that Israel
                        reiterate its undertaking not to be the first power in the Middle East to
                        manufacture nuclear <pb n="553" xml:id="pg_553" facs="0585"/>weapons, and
                        its acceptance of periodic inspection of Dimona; (3) that Israel agree not
                        to use any US-supplied aircraft as a nuclear weapons carrier; and (4) that
                        Israel agree to full secrecy on all matters until the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> decides when and how to publicize.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> said he could respond
                        immediately to certain of the conditions, but would have to consult his
                        Government on others. He agreed fully that Israel should not ask the US to
                        be a major supplier of arms; indeed he had encountered an “obverse problem”
                        in Paris, where the French had expressed concern that Israel might be
                        turning to the United States as its major supplier of aircraft. He said that
                        Israel desires to maintain its French link. He said that Israel does not
                        intend to build nuclear weapons, “so we will not use your aircraft to carry
                        weapons we haven't got and hope we will never have.”</p>
                    <p>Regarding Israeli acquiescence in and support of the proposed US sale to
                        Jordan, he asked what this would mean in terms of action by Israel. He said
                        that public statements approving a Jordanian sale would be difficult; on the
                        other hand, if either there were no publicity about either sale, or equal
                        publicity about both, he was reasonably sanguine that Israel could accept
                        and privately support a Jordan sale. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said the US had received unwarranted pressure from
                        Israeli supporters on the tank arrangements, and did not want a repetition
                        of this. He said Israeli acquiescence is the crux of the US sale to Jordan,
                        and we would have to have assurances that the Government of Israel would
                        prevent its American friends, both in and outside of Congress, from making
                        emotional charges.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> turned to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> to ask what arrangements had governed
                        the tank deal (March 1965). Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> said that, at the conclusion of US-Israeli
                        negotiations in Tel Aviv, he was instructed to inform “a limited number of
                        Israeli friends in the US” of Israel's acquiescence in the sale of US tanks
                        to Jordan. He explained that the trouble came only when the sale of tanks to
                        Jordan was inadvertently disclosed through an official American publication.
                        Because the Israeli sale was not similarly disclosed, there resulted a
                        disparity in public knowledge which made it difficult to restrain Israeli
                        supporters in this country.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> said once more that if the
                        publicity or non-publicity were symmetrical, he would see no serious
                        problems about Israeli acquiescence. He went on to say that, on technical
                        and military grounds, Israel had concluded that the two tank deals produced
                        a good net result for Israel. He could not say whether 48 A–4Es as against
                        36 F–104s would add up to a similar net benefit for Israel, but he would
                        like to put that question to his Government.</p>
                    <p>He continued that Israel had wanted the A–6 because of its far greater range,
                        and he spoke of the vulnerability of the Israeli Air Force <pb n="554" xml:id="pg_554" facs="0586"/>owing to its limited number of airfields.
                        The Secretary said that in this age every air force is partly vulnerable,
                        and that total security from surprise attack is not attainable. Colonel Ron
                        said the Israeli Air Force desires the A–6 because it can carry three times
                        the bomb load of the A–4. He added that the A–4 was, after all, an
                        unsophisticated airplane and would be more so by 1970. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HTW1">Hoopes</persName> interjected that General Weizman
                        last October argued at great length that he wanted the A–4 precisely because
                        it was unsophisticated. The Secretary said he understood the A–4 had been
                        the primary object of the Israeli efforts.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that the United States needs a prompt answer to its offer.
                        He said that Israel can, if it likes, defer a decision on the second 24
                        aircraft, or take all 48 at one time. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> asked what the delivery dates would be if the original
                        order were for 48. The Secretary said he would have to examine this
                        question, but that the first 24 could be delivered in calendar 1968, with
                        the balance perhaps in 1969 or 1970. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> asked what the terms of the Jordan sale would be; the
                        Secretary replied “cash on the barrelhead.” Ambassador Harman asked about
                        proposed deliveries of the F–104s to Jordan. The Secretary said this would
                        be slower, in the 1968–71 time frame, and would depend on the availability
                        of <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> cash.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> said he would have the details
                        of the meeting cabled to his Government at once, and that he would see his
                        Prime Minister on Thursday (17 February).</p>
                    <p>Discussion was then concluded on the aircraft question, and there ensued a

                    <p>I lunched with the Soviet Ambassador today at his invitation. In the course
                        of the conversation, I said that as he probably knew, the United States had
                        followed a policy of not becoming a major supplier of arms to Israel and the
                        Arab countries. I said, however, that we were under constant pressure to
                        furnish or sell arms to the countries of this area and I said that speaking
                        quite frankly the Soviet supply of arms, particularly to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, added to our problem. I said I supposed it
                        was impossible to shut off the sale of arms completely to any area in the
                        world, but we had been wondering, in our Government, whether or not it would
                        be possible to at least hold down the arms race in the Middle East by some
                        understanding between the arms supplying countries to limit the sale of arms
                        on a qualitative basis. I suggested, for example, that it might be possible
                        to agree not to sell supersonic planes or rockets to the countries of this
                        area. I said I thought that the Secretary had raised this matter with Mr.
                        Gromyko last autumn.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that he recalled this
                        conversation but that not much had come of it. On the question of rockets,
                        he said he understood that we had furnished some Hawk missiles to Israel or
                        to some other country in the area. I said I was not sure, but thought this
                        was possible. However, I pointed out that I was thinking of
                        surface-to-surface missiles and not surface-to-air.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked if I had intended that
                        he take this matter up with his Government. I said I did and that what I was
                        saying was a very informal probe to see whether or not there was any
                        interest on the part of the Soviet Union. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked what about other countries and <pb n="556" xml:id="pg_556" facs="0588"/>inquired specifically if we had discussed
                        this with the French or British. I said that I did not think there had been
                        any specific discussion, although our general position on the sale of arms
                        was well known. I said I thought that there was little point in pursuing it
                        with other governments unless the Soviet Union was interested, but that if
                        such an arrangement were worked out, it would have to cover the principal
                        suppliers of arms. I thought that if the more important countries agreed,
                        there would be little difficulty with smaller countries, such as Sweden or
                        Switzerland.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that he would inform
                        his Government.</p>

                            Jordan to the fullest extent” but that Jordan's request for supersonic

                        leaders meet on 14 March he'll have to give in and take <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>s. King Feisal is also in, appealing that
                        you help out <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>. We are now able
                        to get Hussein off the hook by offering him the secondhand F–104s in three
                        increments of 12 a year beginning in 1968. We'll charge cash (it should net
                        us about $50 million too) because the oil-rich Arabs are footing the bill.
                        Once we are satisfied with the Israeli commitments, may we go ahead with the
                        Jordan sale? We'll get some criticism, no matter what we do, but in my
                        judgement, the risk is now less one of Zionist complaints (though we'll get
                        some) than of the Arabs doing something foolish. If we play our hand
                        skillfully, however, we believe we can handle this.</p>

                        he knew some of the public relations problems that Mr. Sadat's government
                        faced. By the same token he hoped the leaders of the U.A.R. could
                        occasionally put themselves in his shoes. He was in a goldfish bowl being
                        watched by 200 million people. That was the character of American democracy.
                        He was now asking Congress to provide him with the wherewithal for a foreign
                        aid program which he considered very important. He hoped Mr. Sadat would
                        appreciate that he wouldn't stand much of a chance getting that money if he
                        started calling Congressmen names at the very time he was urging them to
                        pass the bill. The President thought the foreign aid bill would pass, but it
                        would take a lot of trouble. By all rights the President thought U.S.-U.A.R.
                        relations should be of the best. The U.S. has contributed more than $1
                        billion of aid to the U.A.R. over the years. We wouldn't have given the
                        U.A.R. that much money if we hadn't been deeply interested in the welfare
                        and security of that country. Yet in spite of this there were bad moments
                        between us. Differences were perhaps inevitable in the affairs of two
                        independent countries, but they didn't have to be compounded by public
                        relations problems. Whatever difficulties we faced the President hoped they
                        could be discussed quietly among ourselves and not announced to the public
                        over loudspeakers. The President said he faced many public relations
                        problems within the U.S. itself. People were always saying hard things about
                        him and always hoping he would react, but he rarely gave them that pleasure.
                        The President expressed his admiration and personal liking for Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName>. “When your government has
                        something to say to us, you just tell Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> to put on his hat and come on down here. Let's not
                        talk about it in public.”</p>
                    <p>The President said he wished to comment on a few specific aspects of
                        U.S.-U.A.R. relations. He was most appreciative of the U.A.R.'s efforts to
                        be helpful on Vietnam. He had had a first-hand report about <pb n="559" xml:id="pg_559" facs="0591"/>this from Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName>.<note n="3" xml:id="d274fn3">
                            <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> met with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> in Cairo on January 4 in the
                            course of a trip to various capitals for discussions concerning Vietnam.
                            He reported his conversation with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> in telegram 1677 from Cairo, January 5. (Johnson

                            Vol. IV)</note> He wanted Mr. Sadat's government to understand exactly
                        what our position was there. We wanted peace, but we weren't going to allow
                        the other side to take over South Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>We were not as alarmist as the Egyptians on the subject of possible
                        acquisition of nuclear weapons by Israel. We were watching the situation
                        closely. The U.S. would be against such a development because of our firm
                        policy against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.</p>
                    <p>We hoped there was still a chance for a settlement in Yemen. We had been
                        sorry to see that recently there was some slowdown in the progress that was
                        being made last summer. Couldn't both the Egyptians and Saudis get together
                        and talk about their difficulties? Ambassador Hare said we had been urging
                        just this on both the Egyptians and Saudis for some time. The President
                        asked Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HRA2">Hare</persName> to look into
                        anything further the U.S.G. could do along these lines.</p>
                    <p>President Johnson said that the U.S.G. was impressed by the self-help
                        measures the U.A.R. Government had recently adopted. We hoped this trend
                        would continue.</p>
                    <p>In summary, the President said we thought there was a sound basis for
                        excellent relations between the U.S. and the U.A.R. The U.A.R. could depend
                        on the U.S. doing its part. He repeated that he personally was grateful for
                        the U.A.R.'s good offices on Vietnam and asked that Mr. Sadat convey his
                        very best regards to President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Sadat said, first of all, he wished to express the gratitude of his
                        government and his nation for all the help the U.S. had given the U.A.R.
                        More than this, Egyptians were grateful for the special attention President
                        Johnson had personally given to U.S.-U.A.R. relations during periods when he
                        had many other things on his mind. One problem seemed to be worrisome for
                        the U.A.R.G. at the moment—Yemen. Following the Jidda Agreement last
                            year,<note n="4" xml:id="d274fn4">Reference is to an agreement between
                            the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and Saudi Arabia signed at

                            623–624.</note>
                        <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> had declared that the U.A.R.
                        wanted nothing further out of Yemen and that it was ready to evacuate its
                        forces. Unfortunately, the U.A.R. had been running into some
                        misinterpretations of the Jidda Agreement on the Saudi side. Both before and
                        after the Haradh Conference President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> had asked to meet with King <persName corresp="#p_FAAAS1">Faisal</persName> to sort out these differing views.
                        These offers had been evaded with polite rejections. In Mr. Sadat's opinion,
                            <persName corresp="#p_FAAAS1">Faisal</persName> apparently thought the
                        U.A.R. was desperate and “begging for <pb n="560" xml:id="pg_560" facs="0592"/>peace” in Yemen. Mr. Sadat wished there to be no
                        misunderstanding on this point. The U.A.R. was not begging for peace. But it
                        was ready to make every reasonable effort to arrive at a peace that would be
                        honorable for both sides. The U.A.R. could not get out of Yemen without
                        leaving behind some form of viable government. This was what the U.A.R.
                        wanted to talk about with <persName corresp="#p_FAAAS1">Faisal</persName>
                        but in view of his unwillingness to talk the U.A.R. frankly did not know
                        what more it could do. The President asked whether another <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_FAAAS1">Faisal</persName> meeting of the type they had last summer was out of
                        the question. Mr. Sadat indicated this was exactly what his government was
                        trying to bring about.</p>
                    <p>President Johnson repeated his desire for good relations with the U.A.R. as
                        well as his hopes that differences between the two countries could be kept
                        out of the public forum. On the present meeting, he hoped they could just
                        leave it that “mutual problems” had been discussed without any mention of
                        specifics. Both Mr. Sadat and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> indicated their agreement.</p>

                    <p>1. Request you deliver following oral message to King from President:</p>
                    <p>“After full and careful consideration of the problems you face, I have
                        decided we should make a special effort on a one time basis to meet your
                        request for supersonic defensive aircraft. You are already aware of the many
                        reasons for our reluctance to make this decision. These reasons still exist.
                        Our decision to proceed despite them takes into account the special
                        relationship between our two countries and the extreme pressures that you
                        have felt. The proposals that I have authorized Ambassador Barnes to deliver
                        to you represent a maximum stretching of our policy, and I therefore
                        earnestly hope that you will find them acceptable.”</p>
                    <p>2. You will receive by separate message further instructions regarding
                        proposal you should present to King.<note n="3" xml:id="d276fn3">Telegram

                            him to offer up to 36 rehabilitated F–104 A/B series supersonic
                            interceptors in three equal increments. If the first increment, for
                            delivery in calendar year 1968, did not create “unmanageable problems,”
                            Jordan would have the option of purchasing 24 additional F–104As or Bs.
                            It also set forth U.S. requirements: Jordan should reconfirm its
                            previous undertaking to make no arms purchases from the Soviet bloc, the
                            delivery of the last 24 aircraft would be keyed to the phase out of
                            Jordanian Hawker Hunters, and Jordan would continue to take all
                            necessary steps to minimize budgetary costs of modernizing its armed
                            forces. The offer was contingent on <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss>
                            provision of funds, and no credit would be extended. (Ibid.)</note>

                    <p>4851. 1. Following summary based on uncleared memcons <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>, Noforn, and subject to revision upon review.</p>
                    <p>2. Secretary discussed Near East arms race with President <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> National Assembly Sadat February 25.</p>
                    <p>a. Said US deeply concerned and had tried not become directly or heavily
                        involved. Believed, however, overall area security better served by absence
                        fear resulting from arms imbalance. Wished make informal comments for <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> consideration.</p>
                    <p>1) Before Vietnam crisis became acute US and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> were able by “mutual example” turn arms production curve
                        downward. Vietnam, however, forced heavy additional arms expenditures.</p>
                    <p>2) Could reciprocal restraint serve flatten Near East arms spiral? If not,
                        difficult foresee sane future for Near East.</p>
                    <p>b. Sadat feared little could be done about Near East arms race. He reviewed
                        history past ten years including 1) <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> arms
                        acquisitions to guard against Israeli military attacks which repeatedly
                        followed public professions of peaceful intent, 2) violation of 1950

                        backed by <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> which also untrustworthy. Only
                        assurance for <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> against attack was to be
                        armed to teeth. Small size Israel plus policy encouraging Jewish immigration
                        made expansion inevitable. <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> hated spend
                        scarce foreign exchange on arms, but did not want become nation refugees
                        like Palestine.</p>
                    <p>c. Secretary asked whether fear Israeli expansion or existence Israel that
                        governed <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> attitude. Sadat said both.
                        Secretary observed if former something might be done, if latter not so
                        sure.</p>
                    <p>d. Secretary stressed unalterable US commitment oppose proliferation nuclear
                        weapons. Applied world-wide to all countries. Injection nuclear weapons into
                        Near East arms race would cause US react very harshly. Sadat replied <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> felt equal concern and would be forced <pb n="563" xml:id="pg_563" facs="0595"/>launch preventive war if Israel
                        acquired bomb. Secretary hoped for effective preventive measures short of
                        war.</p>
                    <p>e. Secretary confirmed US commitment applied equally to imported or
                        indigenously produced weapons.</p>
                    <p>f. Secretary assured Sadat Israel under no illusions about US stand on
                        nuclear weapons proliferation. Desired widest possible acceptance <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards. Sadat said <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> suspected Israel had turned down US try for
                        safeguard for Dimona. While avoiding detailed reply Secretary said he would
                        not take that as conclusion. Sadat said “very good.”</p>
                    <p>g. <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> Under Secretary al-Feqi noted <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> had said at Vienna it would accept
                        safeguards. On other hand French had acknowledged to <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> that Israel with France's help probably could now produce
                        plutonium on its own. Secretary suggested <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> recheck this since he understood Franco-Israeli agreement
                        for nuclear cooperation provided for no leave-behind nuclear materials.</p>
                    <p>h. Secretary said if <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> were to push idea
                        nuclear free zone in Near East, excluding Turkey, we could see advantages to
                        it.</p>
                    <p>i. In response Secretary's hope <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> would
                        give intense thought to arms problem, Sadat assured him <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> would never act, only react. Secretary
                        considered this important assurance, but problem was getting Israel to
                        believe it.</p>
                    <p>j. Secretary asked Sadat whether he believed US could ever support Israel in
                        attempt expand its territory. Sadat replied yes, he could under possible
                        future circumstances of poor US–<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                        relations. Secretary said inconceivable US would ever support Israeli
                        attempt territorial expansion, but appreciated Sadat's frankness.</p>
                    <p>k. Secretary described <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> economic reforms
                        as best means achieve respect necessary for <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> play leading international role commensurate its potential.
                        This objective posed no problems for US–<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                        relations. Sadat interjected Israel only real problem. Might not be solved
                        this generation, but time had also solved problem 80-year Crusader
                        occupation Egypt.</p>
                    <p>1. Secretary cautioned about US public sensitivity. President Johnson
                        believed deeply leaders of states interested improving relations should not
                        engage in polemics. Secretary assured Sadat President Johnson would not
                        allow him make speeches attacking President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>. Sadat smiling said he understood.</p>

                    <p>1677. 1. As routine matter Department planning deliver two circular
                        diplomatic notes to Syrian Charge d'Affaires here on March 7.</p>
                    <p>2. Such conduct of formal diplomatic business normally implies that sending
                        Government recognizes Government of addressee.</p>
                    <p>3. Department on February 26, 1966, was handed note from Syrian Charge<note n="2" xml:id="d278fn2">The note is ibid., POL 15 SYR.</note> stating in
                        effect a) present Syrian government considers itself legitimate successor
                        past Baath governments and b) therefore no further recognition necessary
                        from friendly states.</p>
                    <p>4. Given origin, uncertain nature and cloudy future of present <gloss target="#t_SARG1">SARG</gloss>, we see merit in avoiding situations
                        which would require us either give special signal of support or indicate
                        non-recognition of new government. Therefore seems in our best interest
                        quietly accept Syrian government's thesis that no new declaration of
                        recognition required. Routine delivery of diplomatic notes in question is
                        consistent with this approach in that it will signify without highlighting
                        our continued recognition of <gloss target="#t_SARG1">SARG</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>5. Embassy Damascus should not take initiative discuss recognition question
                        with Syrian officials but if latter raise matter after delivery of notes,
                        Embassy officers may in low key cite this action as indication we are
                        continuing normal diplomatic relations.</p>

                        advisable should be handled so as to avoid creating impression <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> attempting mount campaign to influence Arab
                        thinking. For this reason posts other than Rabat should not mention Moroccan
                        approach. You should not bring up subject of Israel's nuclear program. If
                        subject should arise, you may say <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                        watching situation in area carefully and we have no indication <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> developing nuclear weapons. As we have made
                        clear on number of occasions we are adamantly opposed to nuclear
                        proliferation in Near East. We believe if all countries in area having
                        nuclear potential were to accept <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>
                        safeguards, helpful step this direction would have been taken. Meanwhile,

                        involving nuclear energy must be accompanied by such safeguards for those

                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>, after lunch at
                        the Embassy today, referred to my earlier conversation with him some weeks
                        ago on the supply of arms to Near Eastern countries. He remarked that while
                        I was away on my Far Eastern trip, an article had appeared in the <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> which contained a reference to a
                        conversation which Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> had
                        had on this subject with Foreign Minister Gromyko last autumn. The
                        Ambassador pointed out that this had been an informal, confidential
                        conversation and it certainly did not help matters to have reference made to
                        it in the public press. I said I had not been aware of this and was quite
                        surprised to learn that there had been any publicity.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador said that the position of his Government remained as it had
                        been. He said that with respect to atomic weapons in this area, if there was
                        interest in making this area a nuclear-free zone, the Soviet Union would be
                        prepared to support such a proposal. So far as other types of sophisticated
                        weapons are concerned, he indicated that his Government considered this a
                        very complex question and the tenor of his remarks was to the effect that
                        they had little interest. He mentioned that some of these countries were
                        concerned with their own security and, in this connection, they had to take
                        account of United States Naval forces in the Mediterranean, as well as
                        United States bases in the area.</p>
                    <p>Our conversation was broken up before I had an opportunity to find out what
                        countries they considered should be included in any atomic-free area and I
                        would suggest that the Secretary may wish to pursue this when he sees the
                        Ambassador before the end of the week.</p>

                        that continued diplomatic talks between the United Arab Republic and Saudi
                        Arabia would make it possible to reach a solution to the Yemen problem and

                        in, e.g., Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Israel. Such involvement complicated US
                        relations but need meet legitimate defense requirements and maintain
                        reasonable balance and security in area made involvement disagreeable
                        necessity. Perhaps steady removal sources fear and suspicion offered means

                    <p>2) Food will be major issue in next decade. If all countries expanded food

                        resulting from domestic policy. In future planned production necessary meet
                        domestic and foreign commercial needs. This situation requires new element

                    <p>I am glad to report that we have now successfully completed negotiations for
                        the sale of aircraft to Israel and Jordan. Tim Hoopes handled both
                        negotiations for <gloss target="#t_ISA1">ISA</gloss>, in close collaboration
                        with State and the White House. The relevant papers for Israel are at Tab A,
                        and for Jordan at Tab B.<note n="2" xml:id="d283fn2">Attached but not

                    </p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Israel</p>
                    <p>Israel accepted all of the conditions set forth in your conversation with
                        Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName>, but for reasons
                        of “sovereign dignity,” they desired to state certain of these as
                        affirmations of Israeli policy, rather than as conditions tied strictly to
                        an aircraft sale. Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> was said to be particularly adamant in refusing a
                        formal written agreement which might indicate to future historians that he
                        had bargained away Israel's future nuclear policy and opened the Dimona
                        facility to US inspection for the sake of “a mere 48 airplanes.”</p>
                    <p>After debate with the Israelis on these points and after consultation with
                        State and the White House, we accepted the Israeli formulations. These
                        involved (a) an affirmation of Israeli policy not to be the first to develop
                        nuclear weapons in the Middle East, in the body of the basic <pb n="572" xml:id="pg_572" facs="0604"/>letter from <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_HTW1">Hoopes</persName>,<note n="3" xml:id="d283fn3">The letter under

                        of their willingness to open the Dimona facility to US visits, in the form
                        of a separate letter from <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> to

                            <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName>'s letter to <persName corresp="#p_HRA2">Hare</persName>, dated April 11, states that the
                            Israeli Government was prepared to issue invitations “from time to time”
                            for visits to the nuclear reactor at Dimona by U.S. representatives.
                            Airgram A–242 to Tel Aviv, March 28, noted that although the letter
                            referred to visits “from time to time” rather than “periodically” as
                            stated by <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and by other
                            U.S. officials in conversations with the Israelis, the Department of
                            State intended to continue to seek Israel's acquiescence in semi-annual
                            visits. (National Archives and Records Administration, <gloss target="#t_RG1">RG</gloss> 59, Central Files 1964–66, POL 7
                            US)</note> Notwithstanding these concessions aimed at assuaging the
                        sensitivities of a small nation, we are satisfied that the conditions set
                        forth by the President and yourself are fully incorporated in the
                        agreements.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Jordan</p>
                    <p>The only notable problem in the Jordan negotiation also involved a question
                        of formulation, rather than of substance. We wished to make clear that the
                            <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>, while prepared to consider in
                        principle a sale of 36 aircraft, insisted on describing the sale as
                        involving an initial increment of 12 aircraft, with a follow-on sale of 24
                        aircraft being dependent upon satisfactory completion of the first
                        increment. Jordan's problem, on the other hand, was to be able to show the
                        United Arab Command a contract for 36 aircraft. We resolved this problem by
                        insisting on our language in the Memorandum of Understanding<note n="6" xml:id="d283fn6">The memorandum of understanding was signed by <persName corresp="#p_HTW1">Hoopes</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KGA2">Khammash</persName> on March 29.</note> (the basic instrument of
                        the transaction) while making some concessions to the Jordanian position in
                        the technical annex. As a practical matter, we have conclusive strings on
                        this deal—i.e., cash on delivery of each aircraft, and also a requirement
                        that Jordan be able to assimilate the aircraft into its defense
                        establishment (adequate training for pilots and ground crews, and adequate
                        maintenance funds from the <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss>).</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Public Disclosure</p>
                    <p>Neither sale has been publicly disclosed as yet; and to the best of our
                        knowledge, there have been no leaks. An agreed disclosure plan calls for
                        informing 11 Congressional leaders immediately, and 10 additional members
                        immediately after disclosure of the Jordanian sale. The plan calls for a
                        low-key announcement by King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>
                        from Amman within a few days, stating the basic facts of the sale, but
                        without <pb n="573" xml:id="pg_573" facs="0605"/>reference to the number of
                        aircraft involved. This will place the State and Defense Departments in a
                        position to respond to press questions; if asked, they will confirm the fact
                        of the sale with minimal elaboration.<note n="7" xml:id="d283fn7">For the

                    </p>
                    <p>The Congressional briefing will concentrate on the Jordan sale, emphasizing
                        the general pressures created by the inflow of Soviet arms to the area and
                        the specific pressures created by the force requirements levied on Jordan by
                        the United Arab Command. It will also indicate that we understand the
                        implications for Israel and are acting to meet the basic Israeli
                        requirements. The briefing will emphasize also our efforts over two years to
                        find a solution to Jordan's aircraft problem in Western European arms
                        markets, and our reluctant conclusion that only US aircraft can avoid the
                        introduction not only of Soviet <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>s, but
                        also of Egyptian or Soviet technicians—developments which would create
                        conditions incompatible with our economic and military aid to Jordan and
                        which would create new and dangerous instabilities in the Arab-Israeli
                        confrontation as a whole.</p>
                    <p>The timing of an announcement of the Israeli sale remains under
                        consideration. We are anxious to avoid simultaneous disclosure of the two
                        deals, as this could open King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> to an Arab charge that his arrangement with the US
                        had triggered a larger sale to Israel. In this regard, the Arab Prime
                        Ministers, at their recent meeting in Cairo, specifically condemned previous
                        US military sales to Israel and warned the US against the consequences of
                        future sales. Within limits, the Israelis agree with our arguments against
                        simultaneity; they do not wish their deal to be linked to Jordan, preferring
                        to place it in the larger context of the Arab threat as a whole. On the
                        other hand, Israel definitely desires a short time-lag between the two
                        announcements—perhaps 10 to 14 days—whereas we are hoping for an interval of
                        about two months. Our view may be optimistic, and events could force an
                        earlier disclosure. Nevertheless, we intend to keep the pressure on
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> and his colleagues
                        to reassure their American friends that Israel's interests are being met by
                        actions of the United States, and thus to prevent or damp down domestic
                        protests of the Jordan sale. As you know, this is a touchy business and must
                        be played to some extent by ear. We will however be prepared to make an
                        announcement of the Israeli sale from Washington at any time it is deemed
                        necessary.</p>
                    <p>The negotiations are, however, successfully behind us.</p>

                        expressed principal concern at possible Communist take-over in Syria saying
                        Jordan could not tolerate such situation. He concerned by present trend that
                        direction, thought Syrian situation would get worse before better but
                        doubted <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> had substantial assets
                        there. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, however, might try
                        obtain US acquiescence to effort reestablish <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> with Syria. Listing friends on whom Jordan could count King
                        mentioned Iran and <gloss target="#t_SAG1">SAG</gloss>. He thought
                        conditions Iraq somewhat improved and agreed Lebanon friendly. Kuwait and
                        Gulf area were open to extremists.</p>
                    <p>6. Asked by <persName corresp="#p_HRA2">Hare</persName> if they discerned any
                        new pattern to Communist approach in Middle East <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> and <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> both
                        agreed Communists had abandoned open, “united front” approach and were
                        infiltrating poison directly into various groups, increasing number of which
                        had adopted Marxist dogma and phraseology. Soviets according to <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> are building a presence in Jordan
                        and neighboring countries, largely through aid.</p>
                    <p>7. With <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> said he expects deterioration
                        in relations and he trying stabilize home base in anticipation <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> storms. He thought <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> would probably try get out of Arab
                        Summit meetings, although he (<persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>) would try save them. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, he said, must get out of Yemen. Replying to implied
                        criticism US approach to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HRA2">Hare</persName> asserted <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> not a chosen US instrument, that
                            <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> had no illusion about <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> and many decisions taken in face

                        interpretation its best interests.</p>
                    <p>8. In context threat of Syria and <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> said
                        Jordan would do best resist through own strength but Jordan not an island
                        and must work with friends. In obvious allusion US he asked whether Jordan's
                        friends have a policy or do they approach Jordan only in terms Arab-Israel
                        dispute.</p>
                    <p>9. Pursuing this theme <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> and
                            <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> urged <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> consider collaborating with <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> in continuing assessment situation in Middle East directed
                        toward preventing Communist take-over through some degree advance
                        contingency planning. Carefully avoiding any implication favorable <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> response such proposal, <persName corresp="#p_HRA2">Hare</persName> pointed to nebulous nature
                        contingencies and difficulty being precise about circumstances which would
                        involve commitment. Major danger, he said, would lie in taking action in
                        situation which seemed within commitment but which in actual fact was not of
                        type envisaged. Past instances when Syria “lost” was case in point. However,
                            <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> would be prepared keep in very close
                        touch on problem. <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> urged us
                        consider problem “with certain sense of urgency” since situation in Syria or
                        elsewhere in Middle East could blow up at any time.</p>

                        that a little warning might keep him from exploding in public. This tactic
                        worked well when we sold Israel their Hawk missiles in 1962. However, he
                        will make his annual May Day speech Sunday. If he sounds off on the sale,
                        State will issue a low-key confirmation. If we get over that hurdle, we will
                        press the Israelis to delay announcement until about 13 May—after the Arab
                        Defense Ministers' meeting in Cairo. Before that announcement, we will brief

                            <persName corresp="#p_EE1">Evron</persName>, I noted especially U.S.
                        position in event <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> goes to UNSC. Also
                        emphasized concern at increasing tension Syrian frontier urging restraint
                        and disadvantages to all should Israelis have recourse military action.</p>
                    <pb n="578" xml:id="pg_578" facs="0610"/>
                    <p>2. Bitan said would immediately pass views to higher authority as he has
                        already done with report <persName corresp="#p_DRP1">Davies</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_EE1">Evron</persName>
                        conversation. He took occasion reiterate Israeli motivation underlying
                        recourse to this raid on Jordan. Emphasizing Israeli reluctance take such
                        measure, he said single most important consideration from <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> standpoint is fact <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> must be able impress its border settlers with <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> ability protect them in face of attacks
                        involving Israeli lives. He added that <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
                        experience in past has been that period of quiet and stability on borders
                        has ensued following demonstration Israeli determination this manner
                        although he admitted impossible be sure past pattern could be anticipated
                        with confidence. He made major point that <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> unable devise effective alternative, only other recourse
                        aside from diplomatic intervention being to <gloss target="#t_UNTSO1">UNTSO</gloss>, which invariably takes position evidence insufficient
                        convince it of Jordanian origin Fatah incursion.</p>
                    <p>3. Bitan said <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> disturbed by increasing
                        tension Syria but he does not have impression action likely that connection
                        in absence unforeseen variation in Syrian tactics.</p>

                    <p>1. In course conversation with King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> 6:00 p.m. May 2 on subject Israeli raids and <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> reaction thereto, <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> assured me that 1) <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> doing all possible prevent incursions by
                        infiltrators from Jordan territory into Israel and 2) although he under
                        heavy pressure from domestic population and army to “do something” there
                        would be no military retaliation by <gloss target="#t_JAA1">JAA</gloss> at
                        this time. However King added “Do not <pb n="579" xml:id="pg_579" facs="0611"/>come to me on next occasion asking that I restrain army. We
                        cannot continue take attacks this sort and retaliation apparently only
                        language Israelis understand.”</p>
                    <p>2. Told <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> I had sought audience
                        first because of remarks by Sharif <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> earlier in day first to <gloss target="#t_DATT1">DATT</gloss> (reported <gloss target="#t_DATT1">DATT</gloss> 0609 May

                        line of source text not declassified] that regime under heavy pressure both
                        from civilian populace and army to take some sort retaliatory action for
                        Israeli raids and his comment that next forty-eight hours would be critical
                        in reaching decision on what course Jordan would follow. Referred also my
                        talk <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> May 1 reported <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>'s assurances would seem preclude military
                        retaliation in absence any further attacks from Israelis.</p>
                    <p>3. Asked what he thought were Israelis' objective these raids <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> replied he unable comprehend them.
                        He thought surely they understood such action played directly into hands of
                        extremists within Jordan making pursuit moderate course by <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> more difficult. As possible reason he
                        suggested Israeli desire provoke Jordanians and set stage for major Israeli
                        attack. He reiterated extreme difficulty his position and stressed hope
                            <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> could make <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> see light in order prevent repetition latest events.</p>
                    <p>4. I thanked <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> for his
                        assurances which I said would be most appreciated Washington. Said I had to
                        add that even should repetition occur would hope he would not find it
                        necessary retaliate with force. Promised convey to Washington his plea for
                        understanding of extreme pressure to which his regime subjected by incidents
                        this sort.</p>
                    <p>5. Incidentally, in conversation with British Ambassador, who preceded me in
                        audience with King, Sir Roderick volunteered remark that these latest
                        Israeli raids make position of moderates like King and Prime Minister
                        impossible. Israelis knew this and accordingly he wondered if they wanted
                        peace. Added he had sent strong message this effect London.</p>
                    <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: King outwardly calm but reflected mental
                        anguish at dilemma having restrain army once again in face political and
                        army pressures. I avoided inquiring whether <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> intended take issue to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>,
                        fearing this might be regarded as US suggestion this effect. <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> did not mention subject.</p>

                    <p>Israeli Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> spent most of
                        his talk with me this morning outlining outstanding issues between our two
                        governments. I chose to listen rather than engage him, except for Vietnam.
                            (<persName corresp="#p_EE1">Evron</persName> and
                            <persName>Saunders</persName> were present.)</p>
                    <p>First, he described three major concerns in the current aircraft
                        negotiations:</p>
                    <p>1. Because the Skyhawk will be up against superior opposition, the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> wants it to have the best possible
                        defensive equipment. <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> implied
                        that, since the Skyhawk was Israel's third choice, the US had some
                        obligation to upgrade its capability as much as possible. The Israelis want
                        the Sidewinder 1–C whereas we have offered only the 1–A (according to him).
                        They also want a radar warning system in the plane.</p>
                    <p>2. To improve performance, they want the Bullpup missile because of its
                        air-to-sea capacity. Israel's answer to the threat of <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> naval bombardment is defense from the
                        air—not a navy of its own. On the ground, Israel wants the Rockeye II
                        anti-tank cluster bomb to combat armored concentrations. <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> said this would reduce the number of
                        air sorties required.</p>
                    <p>3. Worrying about other evidence of our “lack of forthcomingness,” he cited
                        our unwillingness to sell napalm bombs fitted to the Skyhawk. He hoped we
                        could help save expensive adaptation of their own ordnance. He felt that
                        with secrecy—which is in Israel's interest as well as in ours—there would be
                        no problem in our supplying this kind of equipment.</p>
                    <p>Second, I preempted a lengthy exposition on desalting by saying I was
                        thoroughly familiar and much interested. I told him the President was also
                        personally interested, but we all knew certain ambiguities about the
                        economics of the project remained. However, I was confident that we would be
                        in touch with them “fairly soon.”</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> said he was fully aware of the
                        complexities and felt that perhaps the best way to get at these was for each
                        side to appoint one man to “bat these problems around without commitment on
                        either side.” He felt that “the world is going to have this but without
                        actual doing we cannot take the next step.” He felt this project would help
                        open an entire new industry akin to the atomic and space industries. <pb n="581" xml:id="pg_581" facs="0613"/>Israel, because of its great need
                        for water and its sophisticated agricultural and industrial economy, would
                        be a good guinea pig.</p>
                    <p>Third, <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> outlined problems in the
                        future of our economic aid. He accepted that the question had been resolved
                        for this year, but was particularly concerned about the common glowing
                        Washington appraisal of Israel's economy. Despite good performance,
                            <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> said defense costs were
                        increasingly impairing economic progress. While Israel was very grateful for
                        the ten-year credits on the tank and aircraft sales, nevertheless these
                        would have to be paid back and would constitute a growing burden (defense
                        costs now 11% of <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss>). Not only would Israel
                        have to pay its debts to the United States, but, since part of our aircraft
                        deal required Israel to buy elsewhere as well, it would have debts in France
                        where hardware is expensive.</p>
                    <p>This all comes at a time when the flow of capital to Israel is diminishing.
                        German reparations have ended and personal restitution to Israeli citizens
                        will probably end during this decade. At the same time Israel's debts are
                        falling due—$1.2 billion this year alone. Israel has had to slacken the pace
                        of its development program, and some unemployment is developing, though very
                        unevenly. He cited the problem of increasing industrial exports to the
                        Common Market, but came back to rising defense expenditures as the prime
                        problem—a problem we could help with.</p>
                    <p>Fourth, he mentioned the recrudescence of trouble along the Jordanian and
                        Syrian borders. He feared that discipline had broken down within the
                        Jordanian ranks because of the rapid expansion of the Jordanian armed
                        forces. In addition to Fatah incidents, there had recently been several
                        occasions of “trigger-happy” behavior by regular Jordanian troops. A similar
                        situation was developing along the Syrian border, but he could not tell how
                        that would evolve.</p>
                    <p>Fifth, he hoped we would think twice before resuming food aid to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>. He felt that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s requests to us were admissions of
                        weakness which gave us considerable leverage. Israel hoped we would not give
                        him a boost while he was down.</p>
                    <p>I asked him in conclusion why Israel found it so difficult to help us on
                        Vietnam. Internally, he said Israel's coalition government depends in part
                        on one left-wing anti-Communist party (Mapam), which the Prime Minister must
                        handle delicately. Externally, he cited relations with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> as Israel's biggest problem outside the
                        Middle East. The Soviets have left the Israelis in no doubt that they are
                        watching very carefully Israel's position on Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>He denied the Israelis were “out to lunch” on this issue, but felt <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> must be allowed to handle it in his
                        own way. He felt that if Israel had been allowed to begin a small scale
                        training program in Israel for South Vietnamese agriculturalists early this
                        year, perhaps we <pb n="582" xml:id="pg_582" facs="0614"/>would not be at
                        our current impasse. He also regretted public statements here by South
                        Vietnamese ambassador Vu Van Thai which set us back for some time.</p>

                            (S/NFD)</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>1. (S/NFD) A three-man team of U.S. nuclear experts visited Israeli atomic
                        energy sites during the period 31 March to 4 April 1966, and the Atomic
                        Energy Commission (<gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss>) has submitted a
                        preliminary report on the visit to the U.S. Intelligence Board. The team's
                        observations and conclusions, as stated in the report, are summarized in
                        this memorandum.</p>
                    <p>2. (S/NFD) In view of Israeli sensitivities associated with the visit and
                        report, the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> has requested that
                        distribution be limited to those who have specific requirements for the
                        information and that recipients of the report be cautioned of the need to
                        hold the information and even the fact of the visit very closely.</p>
                    <p>3. (S/NFD) It is the unanimous conclusion of the three-man team that there is
                        no evidence that Israel is producing or intends to produce nuclear weapons
                        material. The principal observations supporting this judgment are as
                        follows: The Dimona reactor, Israel's only potential source of plutonium for
                        an indigenous nuclear weapons program during the next several years, is
                        being utilized for nuclear research activities and the site has been opened
                        to scientists from the Weizmann Institute at Rehovot and the nuclear
                        research center at Nahal Soreq. Some of the research projects are supported
                        by funds from U.S. Government agencies. The reactor has been operated at
                        significantly reduced power, which is not consistent with a plutonium
                        production effort, and the <pb n="583" xml:id="pg_583" facs="0615"/>high
                        irradiation levels at which fuel apparently is to be removed from the
                        reactor would not result in plutonium well suited for use in nuclear
                        weapons. In addition, there is no chemical processing facility at Dimona for
                        the extraction of plutonium from irradiated reactor fuel. Finally, there is
                        no evidence that diversion of the uranium inventory at Dimona has occurred,
                        which supports the judgment that the reactor has been operated at low power
                        and that no unreported fuel has been irradiated and removed from the reactor
                        between U.S. visits.</p>
                    <p>4. (S/NFD) There is a possibility that the team may have been deliberately
                        deceived by the Israelis, but the members of the team believe that this is
                        unlikely. They felt it would be prudent, however, to note the following
                        reservations: The team could learn nothing about the 80 to 100 tons of
                        uranium concentrate purchased from Argentina. Although the team members are
                        convinced that this uranium has not been delivered to the Dimona site and
                        that the personnel there know nothing about it, this material could have
                        been (or could in the future be) run through the reactor between U.S. visits
                        without being detected as long as the indicated reactor utilization is low.
                        For this reason, there would be some basis for concern if the reactor
                        continues for another year to have a lower operating efficiency. If this is
                        the case next year, the survey team should demand very concrete evidence to
                        explain the failure of the reactor to operate at design power.</p>
                    <p>5. (S/NFD) The report also points out that the members of the team are not in
                        a position to determine whether a reactor or chemical separation plant
                        exists elsewhere in Israel. With regard to this point, it is highly unlikely
                        that a reactor capable of producing significant quantities of plutonium
                        could be built without being detected. It is possible, however, that a
                        chemical processing plant capable of separating a few kilograms of plutonium
                        annually could escape detection if a serious effort were made to hide it;
                        such a plant would be very similar to other chemical facilities.</p>
                    <p>6. (S/NFD) The report of the team of U.S. experts is the best source of
                        information on the Israeli nuclear energy program and there is no convincing
                        intelligence from other sources which is in disagreement with the team's
                        observations and conclusions.</p>

                        developments in domestic and foreign affairs over the next few years.</p>
                    <p rend="center">Conclusions</p>
                    <p>A. Growing economic difficulties, the costly stalemate in Yemen, and other
                        troubles have produced considerable discontent and even some active
                        opposition in the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. The regime has
                        responded by overhauling the security apparatus, by
                        searching—unsuccessfully—for some solution in Yemen, by cutting civilian
                        spending, and by stretching out its five year economic plan to seven
                        years.</p>
                    <p>B. The program of domestic retrenchment, particularly the cuts in civilian
                        consumption, should help in dealing with economic problems, but it will have
                        to be continued for several years to be effective. Foreign exchange earnings
                        will probably be increased by recent important oil discoveries. To meet its
                        economic goals, the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> has some $1.1
                        billion in aid pledged by Communist countries and about $500 million
                        promised from various Western sources; it will, however, still need about $2
                        billion during the Second Plan period (1962–1965), partly in foodstuffs and
                        partly in other types of aid. US willingness to supply PL–480 food will
                        greatly affect the willingness of other Western donors to contribute to
                        Egypt. The <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>'s need for Western aid will
                        be an important but not overriding consideration in its conduct of foreign
                        affairs.</p>
                    <p>C. We see no better than an even chance of a settlement in Yemen in the next
                        two years or so. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> is highly
                        unlikely to accept a humiliating withdrawal. We also believe that he will
                        try to avoid the risks of escalation, though there is some danger of clashes
                        involving <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and Saudi forces. His most
                        likely course is to retrench militarily, holding the more defensible areas
                        and hoping for some kind of face-saving settlement. In the meantime,
                        antagonism between <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> and <pb n="585" xml:id="pg_585" facs="0617"/>the Saudis is likely to exacerbate
                        inter-Arab relations generally, undermining the detente of the last two
                        years or so.</p>
                    <p>D. Unless <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s troubles get much
                        more severe than at present, we doubt that his regime will be in serious
                        danger of being replaced. A successful move to do so would require
                        considerable backing from the armed forces; this appears unlikely in the
                        near term. However, unless the government improves its economic performance
                        and manages to revive greater political support, it will become more
                        vulnerable in the long run.</p>
                    <p>E. US–<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> relations have fluctuated
                        considerably over the years, and present indications are for a downward
                        turn. This results mainly from the reviving antagonism between <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> and the more pro-Western Arab
                        leaders—particularly <persName corresp="#p_FAAAS1">Faisal</persName>. It is
                        exacerbated by <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s troubles with
                        the British in the Arabian Peninsula, by his resentment at tightened US aid
                        policies toward the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, and by his belief
                        that the US is increasing support for his adversaries. It is also encouraged
                        by Soviet gestures toward the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>His idea is to persuade Israel to announce unilaterally that it will allow
                        any refugees to return to Israel who want to, subject only to annual quotas
                        and security screening. This would be a bow to the Arab claim that the
                        refugees have a “right” to return. Israel would offer compensation to those
                        who wanted to settle elsewhere. While this might not work, Israel would at
                        least have made a move to break the current impasse.</p>
                    <pb n="586" xml:id="pg_586" facs="0618"/>
                    <p>Our preliminary reaction is that, even though there are some good new ideas
                        here, the Israelis would not buy this. They feel they have to put upper
                        limits on the number of refugees coming back into Israel for security
                        reasons. If they were sure the Arabs would reject the idea, they might
                        consider it to make political points. However, they feel that the present
                        situation is tolerable and time is gradually eroding the problem.</p>
                    <p>There are clearly fresh winds blowing in the Israeli Government and greater
                        willingness to think about a long-term Arab-Israeli accommodation. We do
                        want to guard against pushing these new thinkers too far too fast because
                        their hard line cohorts will be all too ready to jump them. So we would want
                        to work out any such initiative very thoroughly before proposing it to
                        them.</p>
                    <p>I think we ought to give State the outlines of <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>'s plan to staff out in detail. If you approve, I

                        any case be financed by ExIm but we would put in $6 million of AID money).

                        many unanswered questions which cannot and ought not be settled today. <hi rend="italic">I recommend that I tell Feinberg that we have decided in
                            principle to appoint a U.S. coordinator to explore with the Israelis the
                            technical and economic aspects of the desalting project; and we shall be
                            in touch with them shortly about the name of our man and terms of

                    <p>You should note that State's concept would involve at some appropriate time
                        the U.S. coordinator on this project dealing not only with Israel but with

                        examine. There is no need to tell Feinberg about this today.</p>
                    <p>One of the reasons for a bit of vagueness in reply to Feinberg today relates
                        to the timing of an announcement of <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> (or someone else) as the coordinator. We have just
                        announced the Israeli aircraft. We may want to save the announcement of the
                        coordinator for a later time this year.</p>

                        morning 24th on missile question. I had given him prior knowledge of

                        highlights.</p>
                    <p>2. After I made pitch pursuant ref <gloss target="#t_CA1">CA</gloss>, and
                        subsequent preliminary exchange, <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> assured
                        me a) there are no strategic missiles in Israel now; b) there will be no
                        such missiles in Israel at least for two more years from now, perhaps three;
                        c) he sincerely hopes within that period of time <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> will abandon its missile program, in which event Israel
                        will do likewise. In any event <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>

                        prohibitive.</p>

                    <p>The Secretary asked the Ambassador if he had any reaction in Moscow to the
                        discussion they had had with respect to nuclear weapons in the Near
                            East.<note n="2" xml:id="d294fn2">The subject was discussed briefly in
                            the course of a wide-ranging discussion between <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> on March 18. According to a memorandum of the
                            conversation, <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> indicated the
                            United States would be interested in a nuclear free zone in the Near
                            East, provided that Turkey and Greece could be excluded. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> expressed skepticism as to
                            whether Israel and the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> would be
                            interested in such an arrangement. <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> expressed the opinion that both would be.

                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he had understood the
                        Secretary was not talking about a possible treaty, but rather the policy of
                        our two countries.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary agreed that a formal treaty might not be practical since the
                        Arabs would probably not sign a treaty with the Israelis. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that the Soviets were not
                        going to furnish any nuclear weapons to these countries and he assumed that
                        we were not and therefore he had not pursued the matter further in
                        Moscow.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary pointed out that if all these countries would accept <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards, this could be a good first
                        step. He went on to explain, however, that what he had had in mind was the
                        possibility that both the Soviet Union and the United States might get these
                        countries to give separately private assurances to us and we could then each
                        tell the governments on the other side. The Secretary asked if there had
                        been any discussion of this subject with Cairo. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> replied that there was not, to his knowledge, but
                        it was possible that this had come up during the recent visit of Mr. Kosygin
                        to Cairo.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he could tell the Ambassador quite privately that we were
                        convinced that the Israelis were not planning to make nuclear weapons.</p>

                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> expressed some
                        skepticism and wondered how an arrangement could be made. The Secretary said
                        he thought that if these countries assured us that they would not go
                        nuclear, they would not do so. He asked if it was the policy of the Soviet
                        Government that there should be no nuclear weapons in this area.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador replied that there should not be any anywhere!</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked if the Ambassador had had any discussion in Moscow with
                        respect to keeping sophisticated weapons out of the Middle East, such as
                        missiles. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>, without directly
                        relating his reply to any conversations he had had in Moscow, said that he
                        did not see much possibility in this area until the Big Powers took some
                        steps toward disarmament and set an example. Otherwise, it was difficult to
                        convince these countries not to acquire such weapons.</p>

                    <p>Egypt and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> may be moving toward a
                        period of closer cooperation in the pursuit of their common objectives in
                        the Arab world. Nasir's reviving antagonism toward conservative and moderate
                        Arab leaders, his concurrent tendency to try to unify “progressive and
                        revolutionary” Arab forces, and his renewed hostility toward US and British
                        policy in the Middle East have almost certainly increased his readiness to
                        collaborate with Moscow. Moscow's present leadership will be cautiously
                        receptive to opportunities Nasir may offer for extending Soviet influence in
                        the area. They already appear to be preparing <pb n="591" xml:id="pg_591" facs="0623"/>to work somewhat more closely with him than in the past in
                        espousing his kind of Arab nationalism, socialism, and opposition to Western
                        influence. There are, however, definite limitations on such cooperation
                        well-recognized by both sides.</p>

                            relations but that a number of disturbing developments had occurred
                            recently, including the continued presence of <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> troops inYemen, attacks on U.S. policy in Vietnam, and
                            distortion in the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> press of U.S. arms
                            sales to Israel. (Ibid.)</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>1. Following general expression concern new US–<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> strains by Sadat, I made general statement US desires seek
                        understanding and not confrontation which I suggested be theme of evening. I
                        pointed out that we had all been delighted with Sadat visit and that it had
                        in everyone's judgment heralded new era good feeling between US and <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. I then suggested that the main areas of
                        their apparent concern today had existed prior Sadat visit. US guarantee
                        territorial integrity Saudi Arabia which had been drug out publicly again as
                        result bellicose statements here had, as the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> knew, existed for some years. US arms sale to Israel had
                        been known by <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> for over one year and I
                        had informed <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> each step of way progress.
                        Sale came as result great soul searching our part in framework US policy to
                        refrain from becoming major supplier arms in area and represented very
                        restrained step. Therefore elements particular <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> concern not new and resulted in part from <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> throwing into public arena matters that
                        should be dealt with privately. Moreover, <hi rend="italic">Al Ahram</hi>
                        with full knowledge they <pb n="592" xml:id="pg_592" facs="0624"/>were
                        inaccurate had built up arms sales issue by charging US with much broader
                        sales than actually the case. While visit King Feisal to Washington was new
                        element visit had been scheduled some time ago for this year although date
                        finally agreed to just before announcement. Difficult understand <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> actions in light their obvious past
                        willingness work for improved relations when factors that now appeared of
                        concern to them already existed.</p>
                    <p>2. Sadat then commented as follows with respect to subjects indicated:</p>
                    <p>A. Arms for Israel.</p>
                    <p>Made statement perfunctory objection not denying effect of <hi rend="italic">Al Ahram</hi> story and admitting truth my statement that we had
                        informed them at each stage development. Stated he wished express strong
                        objection to sale but not to go into matter in depth. Little emphasis was
                        placed on arms sale for remainder of evening.</p>
                    <p>B. Islamic Pact.</p>

                        encouraging Islamic Pact. In fact, <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> has

                        interests limited. I pointed out Latin American countries with which <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> maintained relations could not be expected
                        look with favor on resolutions inviting their overthrow and this concern
                        inevitably resulted in US being drawn into issue which could cause
                        difficulty in US–<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> relations. Sadat stated
                        impossible change <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> policy and indicated
                        1968 conference would proceed on schedule. I predicted <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> could expect Latin American countries to
                        reflect concern when specific intentions proceed conference became known.
                        Sadat believed Latin American countries would and could wait until they saw
                        nature of conference before they became unduly upset.</p>

                    <p>D. Yemen.</p>
                    <p>Confrontation between <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> and
                        Feisal already in existence. Feisal could not act as belligerent or
                        confident as he does without US support. US appears completely on his side.
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s speeches to which US had
                        objected so strongly came after months <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                        effort resolve issue and he emphasised certain actions were threatened only
                        in certain contingencies. Door still open and always open and basic desire
                        for peace unchanged. Sadat told Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>
                        <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> would wait two months for solution and
                        then shift to new policy which is exactly what has happened. However, desire
                        for peace still exists and <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> open to help
                        from third parties. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName>
                        then suggested US mediate situation to which Sadat nodded pleasantly; for
                        rest of evening <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> kept referring
                        to Sadat's desire for US mediation although only <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> really pressed point. I stated one mediation effort
                        already underway for which Sadat indicated little hope. I expressed doubt
                        any country would wish enter mediation efforts unless it considered there
                        was willingness both sides seek solution and all efforts at mediation not
                        helped by public threats. Sadat warned President had speech scheduled June
                        15 at which time he expected to go beyond anything thus far in attack on
                        Feisal. Speeches on Yemen had been popular in country and were essential in
                        view loss Egyptian life and requirement to forestall charge Yemen operation
                        had not been successful. <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> again
                        pressed mediation idea pointing out we were only ones concerned and only
                        country with leverage on Feisal, therefore problem ours. I stated most
                        emphatically Yemen war not our war and those directly involved must seek
                        solution and not wait for outside help which they were hardly
                        encouraging.</p>
                    <p>E. Aden.</p>
                    <p>Emphasis in dealing with South Arabian peninsula was placed subsidiary
                        problem which could be solved if Yemen issue resolved. Deep distrust British
                        expressed vehemently and we received no encouragement our urging for
                        constructive help toward government Aden area reflective people's
                        wishes.</p>
                    <p>F. Aid.</p>
                    <p> US aid always too little, too late, too tied with strings, etc. Level of aid
                        going India and elsewhere makes <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> wonder
                        why we will not help them as much as we help others. <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> desperately needs our food and economic situation very
                        difficult but under no circumstances will <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> accept aid with strings. If <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> not assisted by US, great pressure will be exerted on them
                        toward increasing reliance Eastern bloc.</p>
                    <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: Conversation was useful as means
                        [garble—maintaining?] channels and exchanging points of view. While I spoke
                        at great length on US attitudes along established lines, I do not believe we
                        changed any minds and certainly we uncovered no flexibility on <pb n="594" xml:id="pg_594" facs="0626"/>Yemen or Aden. Israeli arms sale seemed to
                        be minimized and obviously far greater concern now for “US support” Feisal
                        than support of Israel. I find it difficult understand extent their
                        professed fear of Islamic Pact and of Feisal's Saudi Arabia given <gloss target="#t_NE1">NE</gloss> realities and its relative political-military
                        weakness compared <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. Great emotion
                        attended exposition on Havana Conference which dealt with at great length
                        out of proportion its relative importance compared to other items. There was
                        shocking unawareness of the external effect President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s speeches and repeated statements
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> reacts but does not act. I suggested
                        that they not react to the wrong thing, pointing out <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> had over-reacted to unofficial AP story subsequently denied
                        by US. While they occasionally showed signs of emotion, at all times
                        conversation friendly. It was agreed meet again from time to time over next
                        weeks.</p>

                    <p>We do not want to break this fragile reed by overloading it at the start. The
                        steps <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName>'s people are
                        considering—greater contact between Arabs and Isaelis—lay them open to the
                        charge of letting down Israel's defenses. To many sincere Israelis,
                        repatriating Arab refugees would be their Trojan Horse. So asking <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> to accept Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>'s plan right now might push him
                        too far too fast. Frankly, State does not give this idea much chance of
                        success.</p>
                    <p>However, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>'s
                        proposal does offer some new variations on the Johnson plan worth passing
                        along to the Israelis as long as we do not push them. A hard sell would only
                        backfire. So if you approve, I suggest you let me read back to State that
                        you favor a carefully prepared low-key approach but want to be sure we do
                        not appear at this stage to be pressuring the Israelis into something
                        against their will.<note n="3" xml:id="d297fn3">The President checked the

                    <p>1. As soon after Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>'s return from African trip as feasible you should see
                        Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> for review of
                        arrangements under which <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has been
                        invited visit Dimona. You should make following points:</p>
                    <p>2. <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> appreciates considerable efforts to
                        which <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> went to arrange for satisfactory
                        visit in April 1966. We would like interpret success of that visit as good
                        augury for future <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> arrangements this field.</p>
                    <p>3. At same time we consider it most important there be no misunderstanding on
                        part <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> of utter seriousness which <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>, at highest level, attaches to prevention
                        nuclear proliferation in Near East. As Secretary told <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> this is matter of fundamental
                        significance to US-Israel relations.</p>
                    <p>4. As <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> aware, <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> attaches considerable importance to periodicity of visits
                        and trusts relevant details can be worked out satisfactorily.</p>
                    <p>5. For technical reasons <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> considers that
                        periodicity needs be semi-annual. Scientific reason (given to Embassy in
                            <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 938, June 15, 1963,<note n="3" xml:id="d298fn3">For text, see <ref target="frus1961-63v18#d274">

                        you may give <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> is as follows: As is
                        widely known and accepted by knowledgeable international scientific
                        community, a reactor size of Dimona could be operated so as to discharge
                        single fuel load approximately every six months if intended for ultimate <pb n="597" xml:id="pg_597" facs="0629"/>production of weapons-grade
                        plutonium, whereas for peaceful purposes the burn-up period would be about
                        two years.</p>
                    <p>6. As previously stated on several occasions, what we want is full access to
                        Dimona's facilities and records every six months. We believe this should be
                        done as matter of course without need for complicated negotiations and
                        protracted delays that have accompanied our visits so far.</p>
                    <p>7. You should use occasion to stress to <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName>

                            projects</hi> is to surface for you the wide range of opinion and
                        controversy over them. I hope the discussion will give us a clearer sense of
                        how to sort these out and move ahead.</p>
                    <pb n="598" xml:id="pg_598" facs="0630"/>
                    <p>Basically, <hi rend="italic">the argument</hi> is between the desalters and
                        the disarmers, with varied views between:</p>
                    <p>—The <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> and Interior want to push ahead with
                        nuclear desalting. They admit money is a problem because a big nuclear
                        desalting plant, while technologically feasible, is still not economic with
                        normal commercial financing.</p>
                    <p>—AID and Budget Bureau want to save us from building a white elephant which
                        we would have to subsidize.</p>
                    <p>—State hopes we can use these projects to bargain for <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards on all Israeli and Egyptian
                        reactors. They feel that subsidizing a plant might not be too big a price to
                        pay.</p>
                    <p>—The disarmament experts fear putting any new reactors in tense areas because
                        they would increase ability to produce weapons. Some of them have little
                        faith in safeguards or feel there may be better ways to buy nuclear
                        controls.</p>
                    <p>To make the most of this meeting, you might want to state your view of the
                        problem and then follow up with the tough questions.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Suggested talking points:</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">The problem</hi>. We want to push ahead with nuclear
                        desalting as rapidly as makes sense. We also want to keep Israel off the
                        nuclear track. Can we do both?</p>
                    <p>The questions.</p>
                    <p>1. If nuclear desalting still can't pay its own way without subsidy, what
                        about other sources of water? We've talked so much about desalting, have we
                        overlooked other angles in Israel?</p>
                    <p>2. Is there a chance that new technology combined with Israel's increased
                        need for water will make desalted water economical in the 1970's?</p>
                    <p>3. If there is no other way, how much is the Israeli project worth to us?</p>
                    <p>4. Since we are worried about nuclear proliferation, how about non-nuclear
                        desalting? Have we closed our eyes to this angle?</p>
                    <p>5. Should we go ahead with desalting if Israel won't accept safeguards on all
                        its reactors?</p>
                    <p>6. How good are <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards? Are they
                        worth giving away a nuclear desalting plant for? How can we make them
                        better?</p>
                    <p>7. Should we link the Israeli and Egyptian projects?</p>
                    <p>Attached is a summary of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>'s recommendations and of the paper prepared by Dr.

                    <p>Dave Bell, <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">George Ball</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SCL1">Charles Schultze</persName> recommend we go ahead with
                        this year's budget support grant ($21.4 million) for Jordan. None of us
                        likes budget support, but there is a clear political case for keeping
                        Israel's longest and most vulnerable flank out of <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s hands.</p>
                    <p>We have succeeded in getting out of straight budget support everywhere except
                        in Vietnam ($500 million), Korea (steadily falling but still $50 million in
                            <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 67 plans), Laos ($20 million) and
                        Jordan. But in each case there's important political justification. In
                        Jordan, an 8% annual growth rate raises hopes that Jordan is moving toward
                        ability to pay its own way.</p>
                    <p>As you told Israeli Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> in February, we would rather not subsidize Jordan, nor
                        sell tanks and jets to Arabs. But after painful consideration, we see no
                        other way to keep Soviet-backed radical Arabs off Israel's softest
                        flank.</p>
                    <p>So far our policy has worked. <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>
                        resisted heavy Arab pressure to take <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>'s.
                        He has privately agreed to keep his armor off the west bank of the Jordan
                        where Israel would be hard-pressed to defend. He has squelched fanatical
                        Arabs raiding across Israel's borders. He has resisted heavy pressure from
                        his military—whose support keeps him <pb n="600" xml:id="pg_600" facs="0632"/>in power—to retaliate when Israel has attacked Jordanian villages
                        harboring those raiders.</p>
                    <p>Secretary Fowler does not approve this grant because of the balance of
                        payments drain (50% is not tied to US procurement). I recommend you read
                            <persName corresp="#p_SCL1">Charlie Schultze</persName>'s excellent memo
                            (attached),<note n="2" xml:id="d300fn2">A copy of <persName corresp="#p_SCL1">Schultze</persName>'s June 14 memorandum, along
                            with copies of <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>'s June 10
                            memorandum and Bell's May 14 memorandum, are attached to a copy of
                                <persName>Rostow</persName>'s memorandum, ibid., Memos to the
                            President, <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt W. Rostow</persName>, Vol.
                            6.</note> which spells out the compromise he has negotiated with Bell.
                        This is the best he feels we can do to meet Secretary Fowler's legitimate
                        concerns.</p>
                    <p>I recommend you approve the Bell/<persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_SCL1">Schultze</persName>
                        program. We will continue reducing the payments drain, but cutting back too
                        quickly would undermine <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>. The
                        kind of deal we have with him may be cheap at the price. Few other events
                        would be as likely to tempt a pre-emptive Israeli attack and trigger a major
                        Mid-East fracas as the threat of a Nasserist takeover in Jordan. We cannot
                        afford to get caught in a mess like that, especially while we are pushing
                        ahead in Vietnam.</p>

                    <p>1. The Department agrees with Embassy Tel Aviv that Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>'s stand on the missile question is
                        eminently reasonable <pb n="601" xml:id="pg_601" facs="0633"/>and
                        encouraging. We consider it provides a basis for further efforts to resolve
                        this aspect of the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>-Israel arms race.
                        However, before considering how this question might best be handled further
                        in both Tel Aviv and Cairo, we believe it would be helpful to clarify the
                        kind of <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> undertakings which Israel would
                        consider acceptable, and the kind Israel would be prepared to make in
                        return. This is the more important in view of the Israeli estimate of the
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> missile program which implies that
                        acquisition of gyros is the sole obstacle to activation of a 50–60 missile
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> stockpile. If <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>, whether or not he is firmly
                        convinced of the accuracy of this estimate, feels his actions must be
                        governed by it, the question of undertakings may involve verification and/or
                        destruction.</p>
                    <p>2. What we have in mind would be some sort of private statement by each side,
                        through the US or in some other manner, that each is prepared to abandon
                        both indigenous offensive (meaning surface-to-surface ballistic) missile
                        activities and acquisition of such missiles from abroad. To see how feasible
                        this might be, Embassy Tel Aviv is requested to approach <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> along the following lines soon after
                        his return from Africa:</p>
                    <p>A. We are gratified at the Prime Minister's statesmanlike position on the
                        missile question evidenced in the May 24 conversation.</p>
                    <p>B. We believe this may afford an opportunity to encourage the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> to abandon its missile program if Israel
                        were to do likewise. We would have in mind that neither nation would (1)
                        import offensive missiles or parts or (2) make such missiles or parts. We
                        would assume that private declarations, either through the US or in some
                        other manner, would be acceptable. (<gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>. It
                        would be helpful to have as precise a statement from <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> as possible on these points. End
                            <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>.) If <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> resists committing Israel on its indigenous program
                        the Embassy may state that continuing research work in either Israel or the
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> would presumably not be precluded.
                        However, missile production and testing would have to be foresworn.</p>
                    <p>C. You should mention in low key that US information on the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> missile program does not support the
                        Israeli assessment handed to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Barbour</persName> on May 24. If discussion ensues on this question,
                        you may say that, for example, our information indicates the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> is having trouble with numerous aspects of
                        its program, including structural problems, guidance difficulties, other
                        design problems, and skyrocketing costs of research and development.</p>
                    <p>D. If <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> raises questions about
                        either verification or destruction, you should seek his reasons. You may
                        suggest that he remain flexible on these questions for the moment, until
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> views can be ascertained. You may
                        point out in this connection that we recognize these questions may become
                        problems but that we think such factors <pb n="602" xml:id="pg_602" facs="0634"/>as the rising costs and poor progress of the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> missile program, as well as Cairo's
                        presumed desire for Israeli restraint, might make some mutually advantageous
                        arrangement possible.</p>
                    <p>3. <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>. The Department is giving careful
                        thought to possible modalities for enabling Israel and the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, should some private understanding be
                        attained on non-introduction of missiles, to carry off the matter publicly
                        without undue repercussions should the two countries so desire. End <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>4. <hi rend="italic">For Cairo</hi>. The Department would appreciate the
                        Embassy's comments on possible modalities that might help enable <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> to make a private self-denying
                        declaration of some sort on missiles. On what basis might some public
                        position be desirable and feasible? It occurs to the Department that the
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> leadership may already have given
                        thought to this subject, what with the lagging progress of its current
                        missile program, its growing economic headaches generally, and the prospect
                        that as things now stand Israel will probably be in position to deploy
                        offensive missiles long before the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> can
                        demonstrate a capability to do so.</p>

                        of trouble. Instead, the Secretary would like to leave the door open to

                        worth trying to get closer to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
                        and to avoid splitting the Middle East into US and Soviet camps. But
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> has left us little choice.
                        He has almost dared us publicly not to renew our agreement. He has lambasted
                        us on Vietnam. He continues to stir things up in Yemen and South Arabia. In
                        general, he has not picked you up on the suggestion you made to Sadat last
                        winter to discuss our differences quietly and build a more constructive
                        relationship.</p>
                    <p>We are not quite sure what he is up to. Our guess is that he is worried about
                        his political base. For the first time, he has discovered plots among his
                        junior officers and a serious assassination plot among the educated young
                        men he thought he could count on. His stalemate in Yemen has alienated the
                        military. So he is caught between the moderates who know the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> must retrench to move ahead economically
                        and his old-timers who talk a good revolution but have no idea how to
                        develop a modern economy.</p>
                    <p>Taking the Secretary's line is taking a calculated risk. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> may react violently, but we think he
                        is expecting this kind of answer so should be braced for it. Our unreadiness
                        to agree on PL 480 now could hurt the moderate prime minister, who is
                        pushing a sensible economic program. If he fell, his successor would
                        probably be pro-Soviet and less sensible economically. It is equally
                        possible, however, that mounting economic pressures will force <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> to lean more heavily than ever <pb n="604" xml:id="pg_604" facs="0636"/>on his Prime Minister as the only
                        hope of pulling the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> out of its economic
                        mess.</p>

                        export credits for wheat/wheat flour. While there no absolute limits on
                        amounts other than those imposed by US supply situation and <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> needs and ability finance, we are thinking
                        tentatively in terms of 600,000 tons. Tobacco, corn, vegetable oil also

                    <p>4. We <hi rend="italic">are</hi> committed to appoint a high-level U.S.
                        representative to discuss with an Israeli counterpart financing and other
                        practical aspects of how to move ahead on the project.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, I recommend you approve the following steps:<note n="4" xml:id="d305fn4">None of the options in this memorandum is
                            checked.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>(1) Appoint our representative as soon as we can arrange it, even though we
                        are not yet ready to talk to the Israelis. Our own position is still not
                        firm on important policy issues, including how we might help finance the
                        project if we decided to go ahead. The coordinator can help pin down our
                        position and should share in formulating his final instructions. Any
                        first-rate man would wish to help shape the enterprise from an early
                        stage.</p>
                    <p>I recommend Douglas Dillion as the man best equipped to handle the difficult
                        economic aspects of this project while still having the necessary diplomatic
                        experience. The Israelis have mentioned Bob Anderson as combining the same
                        qualifications. Averell Harriman and Mac Bundy are also on Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>'s list.</p>
                    <p>Approve now</p>
                    <p>Wait until</p>
                    <p>Disapprove</p>
                    <p>Approve——as coordinator</p>
                    <p>(2) Tell the Israelis privately now whom you have appointed, but ask them to
                        agree to hold off joint announcement until later in the summer in order to
                        give him time to do his homework.</p>
                    <p>For both domestic and foreign political reasons, we want to space our Israeli
                        gestures. We announced the aircraft sale 20 May. We now have this year's AID
                        loan almost ready for announcement but do not want to put it out while
                            <persName corresp="#p_FAAAS1">Faisal</persName> is here. We have $6
                        million left over <pb n="608" xml:id="pg_608" facs="0640"/>from an old loan
                        that you have delayed transferring to a new one. That could move any time.
                        We have President <persName corresp="#p_SZ3">Shazar</persName> coming the
                        first week in August. We want to fit announcement of the coordinator into
                        this schedule in order to reap maximum domestic advantage and minimum Arab
                        reaction.</p>
                    <p>Approve</p>
                    <p>Announce sooner; give me an appropriate date</p>
                    <p>(3) Give the coordinator the attached terms of reference.<note n="5" xml:id="d305fn5">The attached “Terms of Reference for U.S. Coodinator on
                            Israeli and <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> Desalting Plants” is
                            dated June 25. A virtually identical document dated August 12 was sent
                            to the President with a memorandum of that date from
                                <persName>Rostow</persName> outlining plans for Ambassador Ellsworth
                            Bunker to begin his work as coordinator at the end of August and present
                            his recommendations in November, recommending delaying announcement of
                            Bunker's appointment until mid-September, and recommending the
                            President's approval of the terms of reference. Johnson approved
                                <persName>Rostow</persName>'s recommendations. (Johnson Library,
                            National Security File, Country File, Israel, Vol. V)</note> Briefly,
                        these instruct him to:</p>
                    <p>—Take about two months to review all available economic data (perhaps with
                        the help of a good economist or other specialist) to find out whether
                        further study is needed. A clear picture of Israel's water position in the
                        1970's is needed to determine how much concessional or grant financing or
                        continuing subsidy would be involved if we went ahead. Don Hornig argues
                        rightly that we should not pile one study on another, and the Israelis will
                        not stand still for that either. But my understanding is that we still do
                        not have an economic picture of Israel in the 1970's which gives us a clear
                        picture of what water prices will be acceptable then.</p>
                    <p>—Recommend what further study may be needed after he has completed these
                        preliminary reviews. If he feels we need no more study, he should recommend
                        a <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> position. If he thinks we should go
                        ahead with the project, he should recommend a way to finance it. He should
                        also recommend the timing and content of his first approach to the
                        Israelis.</p>
                    <p>Approve terms of reference</p>
                    <p>See me</p>
                    <p>(4) Tell the coordinator to look especially closely at the problem of
                        requiring the Israelis to accept <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>
                        safeguards on this, Dimona and all future reactors.</p>
                    <p>Our current position is to make this our price for going ahead with a <hi rend="italic">nuclear</hi> plant. We know the Israelis will not accept
                        this condition readily, if at all. But we would stick with our position
                        rather than <pb n="609" xml:id="pg_609" facs="0641"/>prompting the
                        bureaucracy to begin thinking about fall back positions already. However,
                        our coordinator will have to know this problem inside out to argue our case
                        with the Israelis. Moreover, we must be realistic about Israeli resistance
                        on this point and will have to know whether there are other good ways to
                        achieve our objective.</p>
                    <p>Approve</p>
                    <p>I do not want to press Israel too hard on safeguards</p>
                    <p>(5) Attach the coordinator to the White House.</p>
                    <p>The Israelis want to feel that he is your man and, from our point of view,
                        that is not a bad idea. Only here will he find enough freedom from
                        bureaucratic lobbying to sort this out. However, this might bring you more
                        directly under fire, and it might be possible for a man of Dillon's or
                            <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName>'s stature to retain his
                        independence if located in State.</p>
                    <p>Attach him to White House</p>
                    <p>Put him in State</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> opened by saying Secretary
                        had been missed in Cairo. Secretary expressed regret Vietnam matters had
                        prevented his visit.</p>
                    <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> detailed number of officials
                        and other leaders he had talked to during his sojourn Cairo, complimented
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BLD2">Battle</persName>, and said he had
                        been in <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> during very critical period in
                            US–<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> relations. He now in position
                        convey officially that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> wants
                        work with President and Secretary strengthen relations. As evidence <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> intentions, <gloss target="#t_GUAR1">GUAR</gloss> had taken following actions:</p>
                    <p>3. A. <hi rend="italic">Yemen and South Arabia</hi>. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> had told <persName corresp="#p_BLD2">Battle</persName>
                        <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> did not wish complicate Yemen situation
                        but to settle it. <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> welcomed Kuwaiti
                        mediation, cooperating with Kuwaitis and hoped Saudis would do same. <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> had no intentions jeopardize US oil
                        interests or take over South Arabia. <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                        proposed <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> exercise its “good offices”
                        informally to help settle matters. <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> would
                        take no action leading to deterioration Yemen situation if Saudi Arabia did
                        not aggravate.</p>
                    <p>4. B. <hi rend="italic">Viet Cong</hi>. <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> understood US reaction to opening VC office Cairo. At
                        same time, <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> in past had asked <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> to speak to <pb n="613" xml:id="pg_613" facs="0645"/>Hanoi. NVN reaction had often been tell <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> to speak to VC. Therefore Egyptians thought
                        that mere “formality” of permitting VC (who were already in Cairo) open
                        office might be helpful. <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> had no
                        intention embarrass <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>5. C. <hi rend="italic"> AALAPSO Conference</hi>. While Egypt not big country
                        it had big government and not always possible control all its actions.
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, when told of US reaction
                        to <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>'s hosting AALAPSO conference in 1968,
                        had said, “who knows what will happen between now and 1968.” In any event
                            <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> should not condemn <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> a priori.</p>
                    <p>6. D. “<hi rend="italic">Blocs” in <gloss target="#t_NE1">NE</gloss>
                        </hi>. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> had said he against
                        idea of any “blocs, groups or axes” in area. Splitting of Arab world would
                        create tension, attract cold war and Communist exploitation. It was not
                        Cairo that had proposed Islamic Pacts, etc. <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> urged <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> use its influence
                        discourage groupings in <gloss target="#t_NE1">NE</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>7. E. <hi rend="italic">
                            <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                        </hi>. <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> told Secretary
                        “officially but secretly” that <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> disposed
                        resume relations with <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>. Thought it might
                        take place after upcoming <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> meeting at
                        Addis. Intimated that US might help by speaking to Prime Minister
                            <persName>Wilson</persName> when he visited US. Said no real conflict
                        between <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> over South Arabia.</p>
                    <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> then moved to steps he hoped
                            <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> could take to respond to <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> actions.</p>
                    <p>a. <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> delivered Secretary second
                        invitation from Sadat which he said had been authorized by <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>. Hoped Secretary would visit Cairo
                        perhaps around end of year. Secretary expressed thanks.</p>
                    <p>b. <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> asked for opportunity meet
                        with President. Secretary said we would take it up.</p>
                    <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> then reviewed economic actions
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> had taken: settlement for library,
                        discussion re global agreement for US claims, Panam oil agreement, decision
                        buy Boeings, invitations to American industrialists, etc.</p>
                    <p>10. <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> reverted to situation Cairo
                        during his stay there. Said we had won that particular battle but situation
                        still at crossroads. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> had
                        spoken to <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> re US reactions to his
                        speeches on Yemen. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> said US
                        should ask for reasons before condemning. There some elements in <gloss target="#t_GUAR1">GUAR</gloss> who were telling <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> US was working with <persName corresp="#p_FAAAS1">Faisal</persName> overthrow <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>. Others did not question US
                        intentions but said <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> not using enough
                        influence with <persName corresp="#p_FAAAS1">Faisal</persName> and that risk
                        (e.g. demise of <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> regime) was
                        the same. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> under pressure to
                        save his regime. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> saw reports
                        of Congressional and other influential Americans' statements re “no wheat
                        for Egypt” as invitation to Egyptian people to revolt. <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> Army in Yemen faced with choice between
                        something that could be called victory in Yemen or debacle. Some felt that
                        if debacle in Yemen or revolt in Egypt seemed inevitable there <pb n="614" xml:id="pg_614" facs="0646"/>was something to be gained by precipitating
                        crisis now. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> had asked
                            <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> explain pressure <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> was under. Felt <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> would understand because it had similar situation in
                        another part of the world.</p>
                    <p>11. <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> then outlined “transitory”
                        steps he hoped <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> would take soon:</p>
                    <p>1) Reiterate US desire for honorable settlement in Yemen.</p>
                    <p>2) Secretary's visit to <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> at turn of
                        year.</p>
                    <p>3) Appointment with President for <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName>. Perhaps correspondence at Presidential level could be
                        resumed;</p>
                    <p>4) Visit of US Senatorial delegation to <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>5) Support <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> efforts obtain 10% bank
                        guarantee for <gloss target="#t_CCC1">CCC</gloss> wheat.</p>
                    <p>6) Move ahead with grain silo project.</p>
                    <p>7) Encourage <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> to resume loans to <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>8) Support <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> efforts obtain help from
                            <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>(Secretary interposed <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>'s need to maintain
                        confidence of Bank and Fund. This essential in creating attractive
                        atmosphere for private capital. Visits of leading American industrialists
                        also helpful.)</p>
                    <p>9) Postpone <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> debt payments to <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> agencies.</p>
                    <p>12. <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> said that on longer term we
                        had to face up to resumption PL 480. <gloss target="#t_CCC1">CCC</gloss>
                        might keep wheat channel open for few months. Important thing was that
                        channel not be closed. If it were closed price would be high, although
                            <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> admitted US could probably
                        afford it. Question would be whether <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                        remained nonaligned or not. It was as simple as that.</p>
                    <p>13. Final question was question of nuclear weapons in area. <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> would accept international controls over
                        its atomic activities. Secretary said this was very important statement.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> said that if Israel produced
                        atomic weapons <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would obtain bases in
                            <gloss target="#t_NE1">NE</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> suggested that approach might be in context
                        non-nuclear areas ultimately to be tied into global agreement.</p>
                    <p>14. Secretary said he hoped see <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName>
                        again within very few days and give him official answers to many important
                        questions <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> had raised. Rest of

                    </list>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> concluded by saying that the
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> wanted to cooperate with the United
                        States, that it had taken measures to prove this, and that he hoped to have
                        an opportunity to convey this directly to the President.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that he wanted to see Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> again soon to make an official comment
                        on his presentation. As for <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName>'s
                        request to see the President, we would take this matter up. The Secretary
                        wanted time to think about the other points. The rest of the Secretary's
                        remarks would be made on a personal basis and should not for the time being
                        be reported.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary had followed the Ambassador's presentation with interest and
                        appreciation. He was grateful for the renewed invitation to visit Cairo and
                        would be in touch with the Ambassador about it. He hoped that the Ambassador
                        would come in again in a very few days.</p>
                    <p>On the question of divisions in the Arab world, the Secretary wanted the
                        Ambassador's frank assessment of the competition between the Arab Socialist
                        countries vs. the conservative ones. While we would not expect Egypt to stop
                        saying its methods were the best way to achieve economic development, would
                        it be possible for Egypt to consider this a problem that each country should
                        solve for itself? <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> replied that
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> was convinced that it was
                        not his business to change other countries. He felt that if the Yemen were
                        solved, this problem would be resolved. The issue of “groupings” among Arab
                        states depended heavily on US–<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> relations.
                        It was important that Egypt not feel it was being cornered.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary expressed personal appreciation for Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName>'s efforts in the field of US–<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> relations. As to food, the problem was
                        changing dramatically. There would be a Development Assistance <pb n="616" xml:id="pg_616" facs="0648"/>Committee (<gloss target="#t_DAC1">DAC</gloss>) conference next week to talk about the world food problem
                        over the next ten years. The world was facing a terrible crisis. Before
                        World War II the underdeveloped countries sold food to the industrial
                        countries. Now the industrial countries were sending 40 million tons
                        annually to the underdeveloped countries. Surpluses had been exhausted. As a
                        colleague of the Secretary's had remarked, there could no longer be a
                        “garbage-can approach” to the problem. Acreage would have to be increased to
                        meet the additional food needs. The orders of magnitude were staggering. We
                        would be sending India wheat in quantities amounting to about 60% of what
                        the US consumed annually. But still this was a relatively small percentage
                        of India's annual need. It was a worldwide problem which everyone must go
                        flat out to solve. The countries short of food would have to take rigorous
                        measures. We had so insisted to the Indians. The US had taken risks in
                        drawing down its own food reserves to meet the needs of others.</p>
                    <p>Maybe, the Secretary continued, we should look at the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> in the context of the world food problem. We could examine
                        what the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> was doing in such fields as use
                        of Aswan Dam waters, desalination, etc. and come to a projection over a
                        ten-year period. This might establish a different framework than the one
                        under which the US has sent food in the past. A framework of total effort
                        might be an improvement on past methods which have sometimes been unhappy.
                        The Secretary reemphasized that he was speaking informally, personally and
                        unofficially.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary had been stimulated by the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                        statement of willingness to accept international controls on nuclear
                        activities. This was a most important development. We would see what we
                        could do to make it of significance. The United States was utterly opposed
                        to the introduction of nuclear weapons in the Middle East.</p>
                    <p>On Yemen, the Secretary was not sure that a direct role by the United States
                        was the best way a solution could be found. If the US got into the
                        negotiating process it would bring a lot of extra baggage with it in the
                        form of relationships and understandings in other fields. Perhaps the formal
                        Kuwaiti role could be built upon. The Secretary would comment officially
                        later. His impression was that both sides desired a settlement. Certainly
                        the Yemenis themselves must pray daily for a settlement. What perhaps was
                        needed was more diplomatic precision in instruments of settlement.</p>
                    <p>During <persName corresp="#p_FAAAS1">Faisal</persName>'s visit to the United
                        States, the Secretary had been struck by the fact that he had not wanted to
                        create difficulties for the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_FAAAS1">Faisal</persName> had referred to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> as his “Arab brother” and said the
                        Arabs must find ways to live with each other. <persName corresp="#p_FAAAS1">Faisal</persName> had told the Secretary privately that he would not
                        object to food going to other Arabs.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary thought that the view that the Bank and Fund have a
                        constructive role to play in Egypt's development was a good one.</p>
                    <pb n="617" xml:id="pg_617" facs="0649"/>
                    <p>The Secretary said there was no element of truth in the proposition that the
                        US had any interest or any activity in an attempt to overthrow President
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>. This would be beyond the
                        pale.</p>
                    <p>A delicate problem in US–<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> relations arose
                        from the fact that the United States at long last was becoming sensitive.
                        This was not just a problem of Zionist pressures. There was growing
                        recognition of the need for protecting the sense of dignity of the President
                        and the Secretary of State. <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName>
                        returned to the possibility of resuming Presidential correspondence. The
                        Secretary said we would think about this. The US, continued the Secretary,
                        had exhausted its capability to go on its knees bearing gifts.</p>
                    <p>We did not necessarily want gratitude. We could live with silence but not
                        with abuse. <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> said he had done
                        what he could in this regard.</p>

                    <p>1. In noon audience with King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>
                        I raised subject armor on West Bank. Said had hoped raise subject informally
                        in course future discussions other matters but had thought best bring

                    <p>2. Recalled King's discussions with Ambassador <persName>Barnes</persName> in
                        March 1965 (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 536, March 12)<note n="4" xml:id="d309fn4">

                        reached that, while he could make no commitment re internal disposition of
                        armed forces, it was his intent under normal conditions keep armor off West
                            <pb n="618" xml:id="pg_618" facs="0650"/>Bank. Said we had been aware
                        for some time presence small number of tanks south of Jenin; had assumed
                        they moved there following Israeli raids night April 29–30, but had not
                        mentioned them in expectation would be withdrawn as situation calmed
                        down.</p>
                    <p>3. King responded that above was correct description his intentions, that in
                        fact two tank battalions had been withdrawn into hills on East Bank and that
                        few, if any, tanks remained on West Bank. He avoided flat statement none
                        there, and I did not pretend to any exact knowledge as to number and
                        whereabouts of any remaining. Rather, I expressed satisfaction tanks in fact
                        were being withdrawn, at same time stressing U.S. concern avoid any
                        confrontation American tanks across Jordan-Israeli frontier, alluding
                        specifically to Congressional concern this spectacle in Pak-Indian
                        confrontation.</p>
                    <p>4. Expressing his understanding, <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> went on refer to recent incidents between Syria and
                            Israel,<note n="5" xml:id="d309fn5">Terrorist incidents on July 13 and
                            14 in Israel near the Syrian border were followed by an Israeli

                            both Israel and Syria to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Security
                            Council, the Council discussed the incidents between July 25 and August
                            3. On July 29, Jordan and Mali submitted a draft resolution condemning
                            Israel's July 14 attack, calling on the Israeli and Syrian Governments
                            to cooperate with the <gloss target="#t_UNTSO1">UNTSO</gloss> Chief of
                            Staff and urging reactivation of the Mixed Armistice Commission (<gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> document S/7437). On August 3, the
                            Security Council voted on the draft resolution, which failed of adoption
                            by 6 votes to 0, with 9 abstentions, including the United States.</note>
                        asserting this further demonstration Israeli intent keep pot boiling. I
                        countered to extent only of saying fortified nature Syrian side made it
                        highly unlikely incursions into Israel made without knowledge Syrian
                        military.</p>

                        initiatives on refugee problem. He began by saying <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> has not made any decision, but would like to put forth some
                        tentative proposals for our consideration.</p>
                    <p>2. Rafael said <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> eliminated possibility of
                        any overall peace proposal because Arabs would not accept that. Repatriation
                        means for Arabs driving Israel out of Mideast. This left
                        rehabilitation-resettlement as only possible basis for progress.</p>
                    <p>3. He recalled US and <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> had negotiated
                        resettlement projects with Syria, Egypt and Jordan under <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss> rehabilitation fund in early fifties,
                        and then proposed we prepare ground at <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> for
                        creation of similar rehabilitation instrument financed by international
                        subscription to which Israel could contribute with help of loans.</p>
                    <p>4. When Secretary asked if <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> excludes
                        repatriation, Rafael said yes, at this stage, because repatriation is symbol
                        of Arab hostility to existence of Israel. Time is ripe, he said, for
                        rehabilitation and against repatriation which is not realistic basis for
                        settlement. <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> is inspired by <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>'s speech,<note n="2" xml:id="d310fn2">Reference is to a June 14 speech by King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> in which, inter alia, he
                            declared his rejection of “the absurd logic and the weak policy which
                            advocates keeping Palestinians in tents and camps surrounded by barbed
                            wire.” Telegram 787 from Amman, June 20, transmitted that portion of his
                            speech. (Ibid., POL 15–1 JORDAN) The Embassy in Amman commented on the
                            speech in telegrams 776, June 15, and 778, June 16, highlighting what
                            telegram 778 called the King's “blistering attack” on the <gloss target="#t_PLO1">PLO</gloss>, and his charge that the peril of
                            Communism was greater and more dangerous than that of Zionism. (Both
                            ibid.)</note> he said, and believes his ideas about “breaking down walls
                        of <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss> and getting refugees out of
                        camps” should be encouraged.</p>
                    <p>5. In reply to question, Rafael said Jordan should be approached separately,
                        because divisions in Arab world would prevent Arabs from acting as group.
                        Lebanon would go along when feasible, <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> added.</p>
                    <p>6. When Secretary asked if <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> already in
                        touch with any Jordanians on this, Rafael said no, <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> wanted first to discuss with <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>. <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> does not want to make
                        approach, he said.</p>
                    <pb n="620" xml:id="pg_620" facs="0652"/>
                    <p>7. He then added <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> for time being only
                        wants to prepare groundwork at <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> for
                        this project, i.e. to conduct debate in such way as to show Arabs <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss> is not permanent fixture, that <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> will not respond to further Arab attempts to
                        politicize this question. When Secretary asked if <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> then would be final rather than first step, Rafael said
                        first steps would be reform of <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss>,
                        reduction of relief rolls, elimination of <gloss target="#t_PLA1">PLA</gloss>, then assuring that host states prepared to take over
                        responsibility—these would prepare ground for this proposal.</p>
                    <p>8. Rafael asked if US would take up proposal with Jordanians. Secretary said
                            <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> could not take lead. If we broached
                        idea, question of repatriation would immediately arise. He suggested
                        Israelis might wish approach SYG Thant and ask him if he would take this up.
                        Jordanians should be asked if King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>'s speech indicated any Arab interest in
                        rehabilitation, he added.</p>
                    <p>9. Rafael said this idea was <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> constructive
                        approach to problem. If this not acceptable, he indicated, many felt <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> should simply take no action but remain
                        strong and wait for more favorable time for dealing with refugee
                        problem.</p>
                    <p>10. Secretary noted that Arabs know rehabilitation has been available to them
                        from outset. He said he had no indication they had changed in their negative
                        attitude toward it. He also cautioned that <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                        unlikely to forget repatriation aspect of resolutions.</p>
                    <p>11. Secretary concluded by stating he not rejecting suggestion “if you and
                        Arabs agree on it,” but indicated again Israelis should sound out Arabs
                        through their own means.</p>
                    <p>12. Above is full record of conversation and no additional <gloss target="#t_memcon1">memcon</gloss> being prepared.</p>

                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> July 28:</p>
                    <p>1. US wants find continually strengthened basis for its relations with <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. This does not mean we seek agreement all
                        points. Does mean it important that we look at points difference, resolve
                        them if we can or try to circumscribe them if we cannot.</p>
                    <p>2. Secretary wants come Cairo but unable set date at this time. Not likely be
                        before November. Secretary would like visit Cairo and other countries in
                        area.</p>
                    <p>3. We would let <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> know re
                        appointment with President.</p>
                    <p>4. Congressional visits to <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> would be
                        useful, probably more feasible after November elections. We could exchange
                        suggestions as to whom <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> might wish
                        invite.</p>
                    <p>5. Re Yemen, Secretary said we had taken full note <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName>'s July 13 statement that <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> would do nothing exacerbate situation provided <gloss target="#t_SAG1">SAG</gloss> did likewise. Everyone seemed want
                        settlement but up to present settlement “just beyond our fingertips.” We
                        remained interested in settlement and would continue direct contacts with
                        interested party. We did not wish undertake formal role in mediation but
                        would pass on thoughts or ideas as they occurred.</p>
                    <p>6. Secretary congratulated <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> for having
                        obtained necessary 10% American bank guarantees for <gloss target="#t_CCC1">CCC</gloss> food purchases and said we would try expedite <gloss target="#t_CCC1">CCC</gloss> implementations.</p>
                    <p>7. On <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>'s longer term food needs, Secretary
                        noted <hi rend="italic">El Sayah</hi> July 22 statement to <persName corresp="#p_HRA2">Hare</persName> that <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> hoped be able obtain food requirements without outside
                        assistance by 1972. On unofficial basis Secretary suggested might be helpful
                        if <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> could let us have what information it
                        could on its plan. Seemed to Secretary that approaching <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> food problem in broader framework of world
                        situation might allow all of us to be more constructive and more
                        relaxed.</p>
                    <p>8. Secretary emphasized that maintaining confidence of <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>
                        was extremely important to any country.</p>

                            <ref target="#d310">Document 310</ref>.</note> Secretary raised question
                        of Israeli nuclear intentions. He noted Soviet interest in denuclearization
                        and said that if Israel would agree to <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>
                        safeguards, he believed its Arab neighbors would also agree and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would go along. Would Israel agree to
                            <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards, he asked.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador Rafael said Israel was not giving any thought to it at present
                        because of <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>'s concern for broader problem
                        of conventional weapons. Rafael said Soviets did not indicate to Israelis in
                        Geneva they would be willing to limit conventional arms in area in exchange
                        for nuclear ban. He added Israel made clear its position it would not be
                        first to introduce nuclear weapons in Near East.</p>
                    <p>Secretary noted our assumption <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> does not
                        wish go nuclear, and added: If you do, you will lose US support. If on the
                        other hand, you accepted nuclear ban, he continued, your neighbors would
                        follow you and that would be first step toward reduction of tensions.
                        Secretary said we cannot guarantee <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        interested in conventional arms limitation, but nuclear question can be
                        separated out and that consideration is fundamental to US position.</p>
                    <p>Secretary then told Israelis that nothing would be more disastrous to <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> than enter nuclear weapon field, and urged
                        them to agree to international safeguards. When Rafael protested nuclear ban
                        does not take care of <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>'s problem with
                        conventional weapons, Secretary said: <pb n="623" xml:id="pg_623" facs="0655"/>This means then you want to hang on to the threat of
                        nuclear weapons. Rafael said no, <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> has
                        made position clear in Knesset, but there are some people in Israel—not in
                        govt—who say Israel should go nuclear.</p>
                    <p>Secretary said either this card is in your deck, or it is not. If it's not,
                        then get it out of the way by accepting safeguards. He again noted that if
                        Israel is holding open the nuclear option, it should forget US support. We
                        would not be with you, he said.</p>
                    <p>Secretary asked Israel to bring this matter to attention of <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName>. They suggested it might be discussed
                        further while <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> is in US for <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>.</p>

                    <p>Dear <persName corresp="#p_DRP1">Rodger</persName>:</p>
                    <p>Ever since arriving here a little more than a year ago, I have sought some
                        way of breaking out of the ever tightening circle of our relations with the
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> occasioned by our own political
                        realities on the one hand and the continuing foreign adventures of the
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> on the other. May I say that I have
                        always been absolutely convinced of the necessity, if at all possible, of
                        retaining the maximum Western position in the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. Frankly I am discouraged.</p>
                    <p>The following are my own comments and I have not discussed them with the
                        staff:</p>
                    <p>1. Haikel's 22 July article (Cairo 381) and <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s 23 July speech (Cairo 388)<note n="2" xml:id="d313fn2">Both telegrams are dated July 22. (Ibid.)</note> could
                        indicate that the <gloss target="#t_UARG1">UARG</gloss> is no longer
                        thinking in terms of an eventual affirmative U.S. response to their $150
                        million PL 480 food request and are preparing to act accordingly.</p>
                    <p>2. If this is true, and there is other evidence to substantiate such a
                        conclusion, we may, indeed, be in for the “hot” summer Haikel referred to
                        earlier.</p>
                    <pb n="624" xml:id="pg_624" facs="0656"/>
                    <p>3. Without the restraints imposed by food expectations and facing a
                        deteriorating internal economic situation and an external financial crisis,
                        we may see an increasing resort to foreign “adventures” such as terrorism in
                        Saudi Arabia designed as a prelude to a “war of liberation” against the
                            <persName corresp="#p_FAAAS1">Faisal</persName> regime, greatly
                        increased terrorism in Aden to force a British withdrawal and humiliation
                        before 1968, renewal of the campaign against Wheelus Field and open support
                        for North Viet Nam and the Viet Cong. This latter change from the official
                        neutral attitude could be presaged in <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s speech; “American hostile action against North Viet
                        Nam is an obstacle to peaceful settlement—We must—denounce American hostile
                        action—.”</p>
                    <p>4. Since there has been no discernible improvement in the overall climate of
                            U.S.-<gloss target="#t_UARG1">UARG</gloss> relations since the May
                            <gloss target="#t_IRG1">IRG</gloss> meeting, I believe Washington should
                        reconsider whether it is really in our long range interests, if indeed we
                        wish to continue to seek to achieve our more limited objectives in the Near
                        East, to tie food for the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> so tightly to
                        its performance in the Arabian Peninsula. Are our interests there more
                        important than preserving what remains of the U.S. and Western position in
                        the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>; is it really wise to use food as a
                        club at all?</p>
                    <p>5. Since I have no solid regional basis for recommending any change in our
                        tactics at this time, I wish only to reiterate the dangers which may flow
                        from a starving, frustrated and desperate Egypt.</p>
                    <p>I would imagine that the <gloss target="#t_IRG1">IRG</gloss> will again be
                        meeting on the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> food problem later in the
                        summer and you might at that time like to stress, perhaps more forcibly than
                        has hitherto been done, the very grave dangers involved in pushing <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> into a financial and food corner. If
                        we should embark upon a policy of endeavoring to replace him with a more
                        moderate leadership in the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, this is of
                        course another matter and one not supported in the current draft of our
                        National Policy Paper.</p>
                    <p>Do not feel that you need reply to this letter. I write you only because I
                        want to be sure that all factors involved in our current tactics toward
                        Egypt should be seen in the light of their possible repercussions.</p>

                    <p>After a brief private conversation with President <persName corresp="#p_SZ3">Shazar</persName>, President Johnson asked the other Israelis and
                        Americans present to join him and President <persName corresp="#p_SZ3">Shazar</persName>. President <persName corresp="#p_SZ3">Shazar</persName> discussed some of the impressions he had gained in
                        his visits to Uruguay, Brazil and Chile. He mentioned particularly
                        educational problems faced by some of these countries and commented on some
                        of the leaders he had met.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_SZ3">Shazar</persName> recalled he had first
                        met President Johnson at the funeral of President Kennedy. He had been one
                        of the first Chiefs of State received by President Johnson after the
                        funeral. They had had a memorable conversation in which President Johnson
                        assured him there would be no diminution in U.S. support of Israel as a
                        result of President Kennedy's death, but, indeed, U.S. support might be even
                        greater. He had reiterated to President <persName corresp="#p_SZ3">Shazar</persName> assurance previously made by President Kennedy. After
                        his return to Israel President <persName corresp="#p_SZ3">Shazar</persName>
                        said he had repeated to persons all over Israel what President Johnson had
                        said to him. He continued to tell people about the President's assurances to
                        Israel.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_SZ3">Shazar</persName> thanked President
                        Johnson for the sale of U.S. military equipment to Israel. President Johnson
                        responded that this had been a difficult decision because we do not wish to
                        become an arms merchant anywhere in the world. Nevertheless, we had made <pb n="626" xml:id="pg_626" facs="0658"/>the sales because we had been
                        persuaded by Israel that the arms were necessary. President <persName corresp="#p_SZ3">Shazar</persName> commented that Israel in turn does
                        not like to have to buy arms. Israel would like nothing better than to live
                        at peace with its neighbors, but Israel has been given no alternative. The
                        Fatah raids on Israel have resulted in the murder of innocent Israelis.
                        Israel has no alternative but to defend itself. To establish its own Fatah
                        is no alternative. It must have military force to deter its enemies.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_SZ3">Shazar</persName> at one point
                        apparently misunderstood President Johnson and thought he was referring to
                        the current U.N. Security Council consideration of Syrian and Israel
                        complaints. It appeared he thought President Johnson had referred to
                        “Israeli aggression.” He said that Israel had not always been happy about
                        U.N. consideration of problems involving Israel. U.S. representatives in the
                        U.N. did not always take a clear-cut line with regard to problems involving
                        Israel and the Arabs. Unless the U.S.G. takes a clear-cut line with the
                        Arabs and shows by its votes that it is opposed to aggression the Arabs will
                        not get the message. U.S. action is particularly important in persuading the
                        younger generation in Israel: a “skeptical generation” among a “believing
                        people.”</p>
                    <p>The two Presidents had an extended discussion of the principles involved in
                        the U.S. stand against aggression in Vietnam and its implications for U.S.
                        assurances it will seek to deter and prevent aggression against other small
                        states. President Johnson said that the U.S.G. did not want troops or money
                        from Israel. We were asking for no material support from Israel in Vietnam.
                        What we wanted was sympathetic understanding of the principles involved and
                        what we are trying to do. The United States has commitments to other small
                        states. It was important to ask this question: if, because of critics of our
                        Vietnam policy, we did not fulfill our commitments to the 16 million people
                        in Vietnam, how we could be expected to fulfill our commitments to 2 million
                        Israelis? Yet some friends of Israel in the United States had publicly
                        criticized U.S. policy in Vietnam and had called upon the President to
                        disengage the United States from its commitment.</p>
                    <p>President Johnson stressed that these critics seemed to believe that one
                        could pick and choose how he would oppose aggression against small states. A
                        principle was involved. Either we opposed aggression against small states
                        and honored our commitments, or we did not. We could not fail to honor our
                        commitments in one place and then try to hold to them in another place. Our
                        failure to carry through in Vietnam would be bound to affect our ability to
                        carry through in our commitment to other small states such as Israel.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_SZ3">Shazar</persName> and the other Israeli
                        officials present indicated that they understood this principle and its
                        implications. President <persName corresp="#p_SZ3">Shazar</persName> noted
                        that among the first things he had mentioned on reaching <pb n="627" xml:id="pg_627" facs="0659"/>American soil was Israel's appreciation for
                        the policy of the United States toward the security of small states from
                        aggression. This applied to the situation in Vietnam and what the United
                        States was doing there. Other Israeli officials recently had spoken along
                        similar lines. The President interjected that he had received from the
                        Israel Embassy a statement recently made by Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> along these lines. President <persName corresp="#p_SZ3">Shazar</persName> commented that he was happy he could
                        say he had made his statement before the President had raised the matter.
                        This indicated Israel's understanding of the principle.</p>
                    <p>President Johnson emphasized that he had reiterated to President <persName corresp="#p_SZ3">Shazar</persName> our assurances regarding Israel's
                        security. In doing so, he also wanted to make clear how our commitment in
                        Vietnam and public criticism of that commitment was involved. During an
                        extended discussion President <persName corresp="#p_SZ3">Shazar</persName>
                        said that he was President only of Israel, not of world Jewry, and that he
                        had no control over what Jews elsewhere in the world might say. He and the
                        other Israeli officials present indicated, however, that they understood
                        President Johnson was referring to the criticism of U.S. Vietnam policy that
                        had been made recently by Jewish groups in the United States, particularly
                        Rabbi Weinstein, and that it would be important for the Government of Israel
                        to make known its views on this matter. President <persName corresp="#p_SZ3">Shazar</persName> gave every impression of comprehension of the
                        problem.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_SZ3">Shazar</persName> showed President
                        Johnson the statement he proposed to read to the press upon his departure
                        from the White House (attached).<note n="2" xml:id="d314fn2">Not
                            attached.</note> President Johnson indicated his approval of the
                        statement. He also told Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MBD1">Moyers</persName>
                        that in speaking to the press about the call of President <persName corresp="#p_SZ3">Shazar</persName> he might comment along the following
                        lines: President <persName corresp="#p_SZ3">Shazar</persName> had told the
                        President about his recent visit to Latin America and his impressions of
                        problems and leaders in the countries he visited. The two Presidents had
                        then reviewed world problems and the desire of the United States and Israel
                        to try to promote peace. President <persName corresp="#p_SZ3">Shazar</persName> had stressed Israel's desire to live at peace with
                        her neighbors. The two Presidents had discussed the intention of the United
                        States to help small nations to defend themselves against aggression. There
                        had been some mention of the joint U.S.-Israel desalting project and U.S.
                        economic assistance to Israel.</p>

                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> expressed appreciation
                        for being received. He conveyed the good wishes of President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> to the President and “to the
                        newly-weds.” <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> then said that
                        President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> had very much
                        appreciated the President's photograph. President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> valued it highly not only for its
                        own value but also as a symbol of the President's wish to have good
                        relations. <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> then presented
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s photograph to the
                        President and said it was being given in the same spirit. The President
                        expressed thanks.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> then launched into a
                        lengthy presentation which followed quite closely the presentation he gave
                        the Secretary on July 13.<note n="2" xml:id="d315fn2">See <ref target="#d307">Documents 307</ref> and <ref target="#d308">308</ref>.</note> He said that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> wanted good relations with the United States, that
                        these were important for the entire Near East and that good relations were
                        compatible with the ideals of President Johnson. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> wishes to dispel confusion regarding our relations.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> thought it important that we
                        differentiate the fundamentals from the nonfundamentals in our relations.
                        The fundamentals included opposition to communism, continued flow to the
                        West of oil, and calm in the Palestine situation. All other problems between
                        us were secondary and they should not affect our judgment on the
                        fundamentals. <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> at this point and
                        later in the conversation referred to the difficulties created by US
                        communications media. Since returning from Cairo, <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> could say authoritatively that the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> would adhere to the fundamentals in our
                        relationship and wished to work with us to resolve some of the smaller
                        problems.</p>
                    <pb n="629" xml:id="pg_629" facs="0661"/>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> likened US–<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> relations to a Catholic marriage in which
                        there could be no divorce. The <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> had taken
                        a number of actions to demonstrate its desire to work with the US. These had
                        not just been words but were specifics. They had been intended as “signals”
                        of the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>'s good intentions. The <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> would persevere in seeking a settlement of
                        the Yemen issue but it was not simple and it would take time. The <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> was willing to accept nuclear safeguards
                        “as prescribed by Vienna.” <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName>
                        warned that if any Middle East country obtained nuclear weapons it would
                        create a very serious situation. At this point the President interposed that
                        the US remained adamantly opposed to the proliferation of nuclear weapons in
                        the Near East. <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> then reviewed the
                        list of “signals” he had set forth in his July 13 discussion with the
                        Secretary. The only new element was a statement that the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> would do its best to make the maximum use
                        of additional land reclaimed as the result of additional waters available
                        from the Aswan High Dam. He stressed that after the present “transitional
                        period” during which Egypt was obtaining its wheat needs through the <gloss target="#t_CCC1">CCC</gloss> it would be essential to obtain some kind
                        of food assistance in order to permit the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> to remain non-aligned. He bespoke <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> support for the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> in the
                        latter's discussions with the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> and World
                        Bank.</p>
                    <p>The President thanked Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName>
                        for his presentation. He noted that he was leaving Washington within a very
                        short time. He would not attempt to discuss each individual point raised by
                        the Ambassador. He would ask Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_HRA2">Hare</persName> and <persName>Rostow</persName> to analyze the purport
                        of the Ambassador's presentation so that he could review it. The President
                        said that if the Ambassador had any further points to make they should be
                        communicated to Mr. <persName>Rostow</persName>.</p>
                    <p>The President welcomed Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName>'s statement on nuclear safeguards. He expressed the hope
                        that the Yemeni talks would succeed. He said that the US desired improved
                        relations with the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. He did not feel that
                        there were any basic differences between us. He respected the efforts which
                        had been made to improve these relations. Improvement would come more easily
                        if our differences could be discussed quietly and not publicly.</p>
                    <p>As a final point Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName>
                        stressed the importance of PL 480 assistance to Egypt and his hope that an
                        agreement could be accomplished by early next year.</p>

                    <p>Dear Tim:</p>
                    <p>We have given careful consideration to your letter of June 30<note n="2" xml:id="d316fn2">Not found.</note> regarding certain weapons and
                        components requested by the Government of Israel in connection with the A–4F
                        package.</p>
                    <p>I continue to agree with you that the United States should stand by the
                        decision that the Sidewinder 1–C air-to-air missile, the Bullpup B
                        air-to-ground missile, the Rockeye II cluster anti-tank weapon and the tail
                        warning radar should be refused to Israel on general policy grounds. I also
                        remain of the opinion that we should continue to avoid specifying to the
                        Israelis reasons for our refusal to comply with their requests. As I
                        mentioned in my letter of August 1,<note n="3" xml:id="d316fn3">
                            <persName corresp="#p_HRA2">Hare</persName>'s August 1 letter to
                                <persName corresp="#p_HTW1">Hoopes</persName>, concerning an Israeli
                            request to produce military equipment for the A–4 aircraft, agreed that
                            there was no objection to Israeli production of non-lethal stores and
                            fittings but that the United States should refuse authorization for
                            Israeli production of any lethal items. (Washington National Records
                            Center, <gloss target="#t_RG1">RG</gloss> 330, <gloss target="#t_ISA1">ISA</gloss> Files: <gloss target="#t_FRC1">FRC</gloss> 70 A 6648,
                            452.1 Israel)</note> we see no requirement in discussion of their
                        requests to distinguish between “military” and “security” as opposed to
                        “political” or other considerations and in fact see obvious disadvantages in
                        making such distinctions.</p>
                    <p>It is our opinion that, as with the four items mentioned above, the United
                        States should also refuse to sell napalm bombs and fuzes to Israel on
                        general policy grounds. This is a type of weapon that raises particularly
                        sensitive reactions among the Arabs, as among others. I am not convinced by
                        the arguments advanced thus far by the Israelis that we should provide even
                        limited quantities of napalm equipment. To provide napalm after Israeli use
                        of it in the July 14 retaliatory raid on Syria and the August 15 incident
                        with Syria would indeed risk substantial political liabilities in our
                        relations with the Arabs.</p>

                    <p rend="center">ARAB–ISRAELI ARMS SURVEY</p>
                    <p>[Here follows Part I, an introduction.]</p>
                    <p rend="center">II. Summary</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">A. Arab-Israeli Comparison</p>
                    <p>1. Israel retains qualitative superiority over any of the various
                        combinations of Arab states with which it could be expected to come into
                        direct conflict. In addition, Israel possesses the industrial capability to
                        improve and alter armored vehicles and to rehabilitate aircraft. As shown in
                        Table Ib, the six Arab states—<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> (Egypt),
                        Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, Jordan and Saudi Arabia—which are most likely to come
                        into direct major hostilities with Israel have a two-to-one numerical
                        superiority in tanks, three-to-one in major naval units, two-to-two in
                        fighter aircraft and ten-to-one in bombers.</p>
                    <p>2. In armor, the Arab numerical superiority is offset by Israel's maintenance
                        and training excellence as well as by factors of distance. For example, it
                        is doubtful that Iraqi tanks could be sent across the Syrian desert quickly
                        enough to play a meaningful role in conflict with Israel. This applies
                        equally to self-propelled weapons.</p>
                    <p>3. Whatever the comparable technical qualities of the aircraft flown, the
                        Israelis' better training, greater aggressiveness and superior maintenance
                        give them a good chance of coping with the Arab threat. The Israelis'
                        limitations include the small number of airfields and the short scramble
                        time available to its aircraft because of the fact that all parts of Israel
                        are within a few minutes' flying time of its neighbors.</p>
                    <p>4. The accelerating arms race is involving both the Arabs and Israel in
                        advanced weapons development, particularly in the missile field. The
                        Israelis probably will be able to deploy a French-built surface-to-surface
                        missile with a range of about 270 nautical miles by 1967–1968; the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> may be able to deploy a few considerably
                        less sophisticated missiles of slightly less range by 1970. Neither Egypt
                        nor Israel is likely to have nuclear weapons by 1970.</p>
                    <p>5. The Egyptian Navy presents the only significant sea threat to Israel,
                        which has taken the calculated risk of not building up a comparable <pb n="634" xml:id="pg_634" facs="0666"/>naval force. The Israelis believe
                        that their air power can neutralize the sea threat.</p>
                    <p>6. During the period through 1970, it is unlikely that any major change in
                        procurement patterns will occur. Israel will continue to look to Western
                        sources. The danger of Jordanian and Lebanese acquisition of Soviet-built
                        weapons seems to have been averted for this period. Both Syria and Egypt
                        will continue to rely on the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> for their
                        equipment. Although Iraq will acquire major items from the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> under its May 1966 arms agreement, it
                        will probably continue to procure some items—artillery and possibly
                        aircraft—from Western sources.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>1. Former Treasury Secretary Robert Anderson had lunch with me Sept 6
                        immediately following meetings with <persName corresp="#p_KAM2">Kaissouni</persName> and <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>
                        Mohieddin. He said he had followed script suggested by Sec <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> emphasizing following points:</p>
                    <p>(A) <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> unable make any food commitments to
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> at this time because our assistance
                        is conditioned by Congressional attitudes and affected by pending
                        legislation. Nevertheless <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has sincere
                        desire for good relations with <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and there
                        are no inherent inhibiting factors. We do not ask <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> to abandon socialism or support US foreign policy. We do
                        ask, however, that it be truly neutral between East and West and that it
                        concentrate its energies on internal development.</p>
                    <p>(B) <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> will be judged by its performance and
                        not by expressions of intent. We do wish <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                        to withdraw from Yemen and believe that this can be done with honor. The
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> must come to terms with the <pb n="635" xml:id="pg_635" facs="0667"/>
                        <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> and bring its expenditures into line with its avail
                        resources. It is now extended far beyond its capabilities.</p>
                    <p>(C) Public statements by senior <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> offs
                        which tend to exacerbate differences between us are not helpful. There
                        should be period of silence.</p>
                    <p>(D) Sec <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> sincerely wanted to visit
                        the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and still does and was unable to
                        come last spring solely because of the pressures of other work. It was not a
                        political decision.</p>
                    <p>2. Mohieddin accepted points made by Anderson, apparently without rancor, and
                        made following comments:</p>
                    <p>(A) <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> wants to get out of Yemen but for
                        this purpose needs clear and unambiguous agreement with the Saudis.</p>
                    <p>(B) The <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> is interested in private foreign
                        investment, particularly in fields of industrial and economic endeavor which
                        have international implications and which are beyond the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>'s own ability to finance, e.g.,
                        petro-chemicals. Port Said free zone has been the subject of considerable
                        contention with leaders of the ASU, and it is not likely that it will amount
                        to a great deal in the near future. Other less controversial projects avail
                        for foreign investment.</p>
                    <p>(C) The <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> needs <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> help.</p>
                    <p>3. Anderson will provide me within few days with copy his memorandum of
                        conversation with Mohieddin which I will forward to <gloss target="#t_Dept1">Dept</gloss> by pouch.</p>
                    <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_KAM2">Kaissouni</persName> expects to see Anderson
                        prior his departure from Cairo and has indicated he desires advice as to
                        what he should do at forthcoming <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> meeting. Anderson
                        convinced that <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> cannot meet hard currency
                        obligations to U.S. and international agencies falling due next year and
                        that it would be much better for <gloss target="#t_GUAR1">GUAR</gloss>
                        frankly to inform Bank and Fund members this fact as soon as possible rather
                        than await default with consequent increased bitterness and lack confidence
                        this will entail.</p>
                    <p>5. I find Anderson's visit has been useful and that repetition of line we
                        have been taking here and in Wash DC by well-known Americans outside govt is
                        all to good. He has been very cooperative.</p>

                    <p>1296. Former Treasury Secretary Anderson gave Blackiston<note n="2" xml:id="d321fn2">Slator C. Blackiston, head of the Embassy's economic
                            section.</note> resume at lunch September 9 his meeting President
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> previous day. Meeting
                        reported in press. Following points made by <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>:</p>
                    <p>1. Yemen—We want to get out of Yemen but want firm agreement Saudis to insure
                        non-restoration of Hamid Ed Din. Saudis only want verbal agreement this
                        point. <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> fearful once its troops withdrawn
                        Saudis will restore Imamate by force.</p>
                    <p>2. <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>—The <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> has been very hard in its negotiations with Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KAM2">Kaissouni</persName>.</p>
                    <p>3. Food—The <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> food problem is critical. We
                        must have wheat from abroad. Why did you cut it off abruptly? We could
                        understand a gradual reduction but abrupt termination has made it impossible
                        for us to plan for replacement. If you are our friend why have you done
                        this? Do you want riots in the streets? We will get wheat from
                        somewhere.</p>
                    <p>4. South Arabia—We have no designs on South Arabia. <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> has been giving no support to South Arabian nationalists
                        other than money. We want British to meet with nationalists but they
                        (British) have refused.</p>
                    <p>5. East-West balance—We must keep balance between East and West. If we lean
                        too far in the direction of the East, we get complaints from you and if we
                        go the other way, the Russians complain. The Russians gave us the High Dam
                        and even supplied skilled workers when we did not have them. They sent wheat
                        shipments when you stopped. These are the things we cannot forget.</p>
                    <p>6. Land reclamation—We now have the water from the High Dam to bring new
                        lands into cultivation but we need help to develop areas like Salhia.</p>
                    <p>7. Subversion—They accuse me of having Nasserite agents in other countries of
                        the Arab world. I have no organization and cannot control these people.</p>
                    <p>Secretary Anderson's comments follow:</p>
                    <p>8. US–<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> relations—U.S. Government has no
                        latent hostility to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> but what we can
                        do for you is conditioned by <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                        actions.</p>
                    <p>9. Armaments—We do not begrudge armaments. Every nation must have them, but
                        the question is quantity and what you can afford.</p>
                    <pb n="637" xml:id="pg_637" facs="0669"/>
                    <p>10. <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>—The <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> is hard but it is composed of honest, dedicated,
                        non-political people. I urge you to come to agreement with the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>. It is the key to your problem. Without
                        agreement all of your credit will dry up. Hard decisions are required. You
                        have to decide for yourself where to cut.</p>
                    <p>11. Nuclear—Are you in favor of international safeguards? Yes. Can I then say
                        this back in Washington? Yes.</p>
                    <p>12. Non aggression—Are you against aggression by any country in the Near East
                        against any other country of the area? Yes. May I say this in Washington?
                        Yes.</p>
                    <p>13. Salhia—If this is your great need are you prepared to devote all your
                        available resources, plus what you may obtain from abroad, toward
                        implementing this project? Yes. May I say this in Washington? Yes.</p>
                    <p>14. Public statements—You need to say what you have told me publicly (ref
                        item 11, 12, 13 above). (Blackiston not entirely sure from recollection of
                        conversation with Anderson whether latter stated <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> committed himself to public statement or not. We hope
                        have written <gloss target="#t_memcon1">memcon</gloss> provided us early
                        next week, and will forward to Washington on receipt.)</p>
                    <p>Anderson saw <persName corresp="#p_KAM2">Kaissouni</persName> again morning
                        September 9 and provided rundown his conversation with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>. According Anderson, <persName corresp="#p_KAM2">Kaissouni</persName> expressed great appreciation for
                        points which Anderson made and frankness with which they had been
                        stated.</p>

                    <p>1. Emphasizing I had no specific instructions to raise the matter, I stressed
                        to <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> Sept 13, in meeting arranged at
                        my request and in anticipation of his prospective meeting with the Secretary
                        in New York, our fervent hope that Israel would find way make clear to <pb n="638" xml:id="pg_638" facs="0670"/>world in unmistakable terms that it
                        would forswear nuclear weapons. I mentioned <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> controls as vehicle accomplish end. I recognized that our
                        visits Dimona and <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>'s statement on subject gave us
                        considerable reassurance in this respect but noted that as long as Israel
                        seemed retain option take nuclear route, no matter how self limited it might
                        be, this added to already acute danger world confronts in problem nuclear
                        proliferation. I stressed the Secretary's personal interest and concern as
                        this problem touches Israel and the Middle East and expressed my belief that
                        the Secretary would wish discuss in New York. I stressed that essence of
                        issue is not only that Israel remove this card from its hand but be seen
                        publicly to do so. I used familiar arguments as to importance Israeli
                        peaceful image, as stabilizing force in area etc., and added that since it
                        obvious, as result various leaks, that Israel in fact not embarking on
                        weapons production, <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> had nothing to lose
                        and everything to gain in making gesture suggested.</p>
                    <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> said he impressed with
                        importance Secretary attaches to matter and that my comments lent urgency to
                        full briefing on subject including consultations with <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> he intended to undertake prior his
                        departure for New York. He noted limitations of time and pressures of other
                        matters in New York and expressed hope there would be opportunity discuss
                        subject in detail it deserved. Expressed also his opinion that nuclear arms
                        race somewhat more remote contingency in area than it had been, less
                        pressing immediate possibility for example than clash with Syria. Referring
                        to the Secretary's conversation with Rafael, he took exception to what had
                        been reported to him as the suggestion the U.S. would be “through with
                        Israel” if Israel did not do what we wanted in this respect. He felt this
                        suggestion of sanctions against Israel was not in accord with the atmosphere
                        of trust and good will that should prevail between good friends. (I
                        responded that the Secretary's frankness with Rafael should be understood
                        both in the context of our countries' friendship and of the strength of the
                        Secretary's feeling on this subject. I added it not question of sanctions,
                        on contrary it matter of losing U.S. support.) <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> said that Israel had said it would not manufacture
                        nuclear weapons and would certainly not be the first to introduce them into
                        area. This was an extraordinary assurance when set against the constant
                        threats of Israel's neighbors to destroy it. More weight should be given to
                        the <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>'s assurances. (I replied that
                        this was an important contribution, but that a further dramatic gesture was
                        essential.) <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> concluded that he had
                        the signal. He hoped to be well versed on subject on arrival in New York and
                        hoped to have something substantive to say.</p>
                    <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> In spite of <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName>'s testiness about some things and indications he
                        considered matter had less immediacy than it had had, I believe he will try
                        to get mandate from <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> (it not
                        excluded judging <pb n="639" xml:id="pg_639" facs="0671"/>by some innuendos
                        of his comments that he already has it) to make some useful contribution in
                        direction we desire, and hope that he will go to New York prepared to
                        discuss matter concretely and constructively. He will be interested in our
                        views of Egyptian attitudes. We may be sure he will lay stress on Israel's
                        immediate security concerns vis-a-vis Syria. I reminded him that we had done
                        much lately to permit Israelis to sleep more soundly in their beds, and this
                        is a factor obviously in favor <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>

                        earlier proposals. Israel in fact wanted to bring <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> back to something like Resolution 513 of 1952 with its
                        accent on rehabilitation and resettlement. <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                        position has steadily eroded in direction emphasis on para 11 and
                        repatriation. If these tentative thoughts were non-starter then perhaps only
                        thing left to do in <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> was to try and
                        hold the line.</p>
                    <p>3. I remarked that whatever exception might be taken to specifics of <gloss target="#t_Dept1">Dept</gloss> reply mood of disappointment it conveyed
                        was correct one. Absence of any mention of repatriation obviated at outset
                        any broad <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> support for these ideas.
                        After six months and <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> despatch of high
                        level envoy to discuss with the Secretary it reasonable for us expect
                        something more forthcoming. (<persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName>
                        interjected that 18 years had seen no progress on main issues. Israeli
                        thought was to make progress on marginal aspects. “Palestinians coming
                        across border with guns and knives” did not provide propitious climate for
                        consideration these problems. Particularly difficult Israel come up with
                        idea such as open ended $50,000,000 unilateral compensation.) I concluded
                        that <gloss target="#t_Dept1">Dept</gloss> remarks had been conveyed in
                        spirit frankness that characterized our relations. There was erosion in
                        Israeli positions in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and while we were
                        willing consult closely on tactics substance of what Israelis could offer
                        was of overriding importance.</p>
                    <p>4. In subsequent brief conversation with Rafael, he confirmed <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> upset by <gloss target="#t_Dept1">Dept</gloss>'s reaction. He added, as I had anticipated, that <gloss target="#t_FonOff1">FonOff</gloss> consideration had consisted of
                        efforts rethink numerous possibilities previously advanced and that
                        conclusion had been essentially that none of them starters this time. He,
                        therefore, of opinion expressed by <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> that probably only tactic at <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> is to hold current line with as little fanfare as possible.
                        Objective of talks with US was and is to assure maximum possible tactical
                        cooperation, since it apparently not possible to redirect emphasis of debate
                        toward humanitarian, and away from political, aspects of problem.</p>

                    <p>The Minister said there was a feeling in the Arab world that the method of US
                        approach to the Palestine question had undergone a change in the last three
                        years. When asked for specifics by the Secretary, the Minister cited the
                        aircraft and tank deals with Israel. While he recognized the US position
                        that this was done to equalize Soviet aid to Arab states, he disagreed with
                        the belief that there could ever be a balance between the Israeli nation of
                        two million people and the Arab community of nations. He also said that the
                        Arabs had not been fully informed of the arms deal and he found the timing
                        extraordinary. The announcement of the most recent arms delivery to Israel
                        shortly after Kosygin had visited Cairo made it appear that the US was
                        pro-Israeli and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> pro-Arab. He said
                        that there was an impression throughout the Arab world that the present
                        administration is less concerned with Arab sensibilities than the previous
                        administration.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said the arms problem in the Middle East is triangular: The
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> arms aid is substantial to Egypt;
                        this in turn causes anxiety among the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>'s
                        Arab neighbors and in Israel. The US earnestly desires some regional
                        understanding on arms levels in the Middle East but neither Cairo nor the
                        Soviet Union has indicated any interest. We understand that the US cannot
                        balance off all the powers in the Middle East; however, we have felt that US
                        action was necessary from time to time for psychological reasons. The
                        Minister said that Soviet arms provided the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, Iraq and Syria will never be used against another Arab
                        country. No one objects to US arms aid to Jordan or Saudi Arabia and Jordan
                        was recognized as having the most legitimate claim for armaments of any Arab
                        country.</p>
                    <pb n="642" xml:id="pg_642" facs="0674"/>
                    <p>The Secretary said that there are those Arabs who fear Israeli expansionism
                        and those Israelis who fear the Arabs wish to drive the Israelis into the
                        sea. He suggested that these two points appear capable of being eliminated.
                        The Minister said that Arab fears of Israeli expansionism had a firm basis
                        in historical fact. The Secretary assured the Minister that the US would not
                        permit Israeli territorial aggrandizement and cited US intervention during
                        the Suez crisis. The Secretary said that he was continuously hearing of
                        these fears from both sides but did not believe that they were realistic.
                        However, he did not underestimate the extent of such feeling.</p>
                    <p>The Minister said his government was rather unhappy about further US
                        reductions in its contribution to <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss>,
                        although he appreciated that the US continues to bear the financial brunt of
                        the organization. The US was reducing its contribution at a time when Iraq
                        and other countries were increasing theirs. The Secretary said that this was
                        a difficult problem for us with Congress because we see no end to the
                        refugee problem. The Minister said the central point was whether the
                        refugees would be permitted to exercise the right of choice. The Secretary
                        commented that there may be a distinction between individual choice by a
                        family and organized choice for political purposes. He said that he believed
                        that there would be no more refugees prepared to return to Israel than
                        Israel would be prepared to accept. The Minister stated no genuine attempt
                        had ever been made to ascertain the refugees' own views. The attempt by
                        Joseph Johnson was a good effort but it was weakened by linking consultation
                        with implementation. The Secretary asked for the Minister's reaction should
                        UNWRA personnel begin to informally ask a number of refugees each week what
                        their desires were. The Minister said that this was an “interesting” idea
                        but first there should be agreement on the principle that the refugees
                        should be able to freely express their views in accordance with paragraph
                        11, resolution 194.</p>

                            SYR.</note> Department officers (1) expressed concern and bewilderment
                        over Syrian accusations <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> involved in
                        anti-SARG plotting, (2) stated categorically such accusations without
                        foundation and asked Kayyali so report to his government, and (3) noted
                        current anti-US campaign ran directly counter to desire often professed by
                        Kayyali and <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> Makhus, which <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> shared, for better US-Syrian relations.
                        Kayyali noted <gloss target="#t_SARG1">SARG</gloss> charges directed against
                            <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, not <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> as whole. Department officers emphasized such distinction
                        meaningless since no agency <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> could pursue
                        independent foreign policy. Kayyali replied he aware of this but same not

                        anti-American campaign who, he suggested, are relatively unsophisticated and
                        not very smart. Department officers did not inform Kayyali <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> Makhus apparently shared view of

                    <p>63961. Arab-Israel Border Situation.</p>
                    <p>1. Israeli Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> called on
                            <persName corresp="#p_HRA2">Hare</persName> today to discuss current
                        security situation. Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> also present.</p>
                    <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> reviewed two incidents that
                        happened over weekend, noting Syrians had quickly published Fatah communique
                        on Jerusalem incident October 7. This was third incident in past three weeks
                        from Jordan territory, two previous having taken place in south. Seriousness
                        of Jerusalem incident lay in fact much more damage and loss of life might
                        have occurred, it had taken place well inside Israeli territory, and
                        perpetrators could only have come from Jordan.</p>
                    <p>3. <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> appraisal is <gloss target="#t_SARG1">SARG</gloss> deliberately seeking involve <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss>. <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> also believes <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> does not want to become involved in Fatah
                        incidents, and taking measures to prevent them. Nevertheless, there strong
                        domestic pressures on <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> to act if
                        incidents from Jordanian territory not stopped. <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> therefore hopes <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> can act
                        to clean out their territory.</p>
                    <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> recalled <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> had been told <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> not prepared to go to <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss>
                        every time there was incident apparently involving Jordanian territory.
                        Series of three incidents, however, now justified Israeli request for <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> to bring Israeli views to attention <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss>, particularly serious view <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> takes of Jerusalem incident. <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> wished <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss>
                        to understand it under considerable pressure to take action and so far had
                        resisted this pressure.</p>
                    <p>5. Other aspect of current situation involves Syria. Incident at Shaar
                        Hagolan last Saturday is worst since 1965 in terms of fatalities and skill
                        and sophistication with which it mounted. Four persons had been killed.
                            <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> impressed by both planning and
                        performance this incident in which border patrol had been lured into mine
                        field by timed explosions. Saturday incident was part of a chain that had
                        occurred from Syrian territory. <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> had
                        reported other incidents in early September to Security Council. Incidents
                        coming from Syria are being planned at higher military level and are based
                        on doctrine of “popular liberation war.”</p>

                    <p>6. Although <gloss target="#t_SARG1">SARG</gloss> probably aware from <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> discussions last July and August<note n="2" xml:id="d327fn2">See <ref target="#d309fn5">footnote 5, Document

                        supporting Fatah incidents, Syrian Chief of Staff recently said <gloss target="#t_SARG1">SARG</gloss> cannot stop Fatah. <gloss target="#t_SARG1">SARG</gloss> had also broadcast communique on Saturday
                        incident.</p>
                    <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> concluded by stating what
                        Israel wants is to have Fatah incidents stopped. If chain continues, <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> will have no alternatives. Yesterday in New
                        York <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> called on Secretary General
                        and also circulated letter to President of Security Council stressing need
                        to stop incidents.<note n="3" xml:id="d327fn3">
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> document S/7536.</note> Israel
                        recognizes that asking <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> to speak to Syria
                        is fairly useless. Israeli PermRep in New York is trying to see Fedorenko to
                        present Israeli views to Soviets. Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> was calling in Ambassadors of four big powers in Tel
                        Aviv (including <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>) today. These
                        diplomatic approaches have aim of impressing Syrians with importance of
                        stopping incidents.</p>
                    <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_HRA2">Hare</persName> responded by assuring
                            <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName>
                        <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> deplores loss of life in Saturday
                        incident and concerned about very real problems he had described. <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> not disposed in any way to varnish over
                        these incidents. Secondly, it seemed to us that attitude adopted by <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> was reasonable and instrumentalities it now
                        using were correct.</p>
                    <p>9. At this point <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> broke in to
                        explain both Jerusalem and Hagolan incidents had been subject complaints in
                            <gloss target="#t_UNTSO1">UNTSO</gloss> machinery, former in HKJIMAC and
                        latter in <gloss target="#t_ISMAC1">ISMAC</gloss>. Israel differentiating
                        between two only to extent that one involved Jordan territory and other
                        Syrian territory. <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> had shown it could
                        prevent Fatah incidents from its territory. <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> now wanted <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> to take
                        extraordinary steps to prevent any further use of Jordanian territory.
                            <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> should see it is prudent to take
                        extraordinary measures to track down and stop terrorists.</p>
                    <p>10. <persName corresp="#p_HRA2">Hare</persName> stated <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> prepared to go to <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> to make clear very serious nature of present situation.</p>
                    <p>11. In further discussion <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName>
                        emphasized that Israel raising Fatah matter as whole in present diplomatic
                        approaches. Even Saturday incident has implications for Jordan since it
                        occurred near Jordanian border and might have been additional attempt
                        involve <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss>. Tracks, however, led to Syrian
                        territory. Point is that <gloss target="#t_SARG1">SARG</gloss> has adopted
                        raiding doctrine that other Arabs give up in nineteen-fifties and trying to
                        involve other Arabs. <gloss target="#t_SARG1">SARG</gloss> must be made to
                        see that this doctrine will not work and that other Arabs do not accept it.
                        While other Arabs had not abandoned belligerence toward Israel, they at
                        least were not following border-crossing and sabotage doctrine advocated by
                        Syrians. <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> said Embassy had just
                        received message reporting Israelis had <pb n="647" xml:id="pg_647" facs="0679"/>found mine today at Maryan Baruch, near Tell Dan. If this
                        mine had exploded, something serious might have happened.</p>
                    <p>12. In reply <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> query, <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> stated SYG had seen Syrian <gloss target="#t_Rep1">Rep</gloss> Tomeh yesterday but he had no report on
                        results. In further comment <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName>
                        said absence of further incidents would be best way to judge whether Syrians
                        getting message. On other hand, if incidents continued serious Israeli
                        policy decision would be involved.</p>
                    <p>13. In discussion whether more formal approach to Security Council desirable,
                            <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> said automatic Soviet veto
                        discouraged Israel from such step. <persName corresp="#p_HRA2">Hare</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName>
                        emphasized SC nevertheless could contribute toward improvement situation.
                            <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> granted Soviet veto always
                        possibility, but present incident is clear cut, serious and part of pattern.
                            <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> members have been educated as result
                        SC discussions last summer. <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> through
                        present diplomatic moves has made its views clear and has helped create
                        favorable circumstances for SC hearing based on clear evidence. Even if veto
                        occurred there would be interesting test of Soviet attitudes and policies.
                        Soviets also have interest in not allowing present situation mushroom. Thus,
                        recourse to Security Council might be good and constructive political move
                        and should not be precluded.</p>
                    <p>14. <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> deplored delays in <gloss target="#t_UNTSO1">UNTSO</gloss> investigations incidents and tendency
                            <gloss target="#t_UNTSO1">UNTSO</gloss> to try to balance out evidence
                        without fixing blame and responsibility. This characteristic would carry
                        over into any Security Council hearing. What Israel wants is fixing of
                        responsibility and cessation of incidents.</p>
                    <p>15. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> recalled that even in July
                            <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> hearing, when Israel was accused,
                        Israel had not done badly. Moreover, <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>

                        to observe <gloss target="#t_GAA1">GAA</gloss>s. In present case, Israel has
                        not retaliated militarily, is exercising restraint, and pursuing political
                        and diplomatic remedies; and particularly, if any thought being given
                        presently to retaliation for recent incidents, due weight should be given to
                        political advantages accruing to Israel in recourse to formal proceedings of
                            <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> said he would report these observations to <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName>.</p>
                    <p>16. <persName corresp="#p_HRA2">Hare</persName> added that Israeli tactics in
                        present situation had been pragmatic and wise. Israel was well aware our
                        views on avoidance force. Soviets undoubtedly wish avoid anything more
                        serious. <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> also probably wish avoid military involvement. There high

                        domestic politics that might have unforeseen results.</p>
                    <p>17. <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> said that SARG aware of
                        advantages they enjoyed because of nature of terrain which would force
                        Israel mount major military action. An irresponsible and irrational element
                        in Syria wants war with Israel and is seeking to drag in other Arabs by
                        forcing such major incident. In further comment, <persName corresp="#p_HRA2">Hare</persName> again pointed out present measures being taken were
                        designed to get message across to Syrians. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> suggested that even if formal <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> action vetoed or without conclusive result, support thereby
                        garnered by <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> would be politically
                        important.</p>
                    <p>18. <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> said he would convey
                        foregoing to his government and once again requested <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> be informed about Israeli attitudes, which <persName corresp="#p_HRA2">Hare</persName> affirmed would be done.</p>
                    <p>19. For Amman: Request Charge inform <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> at
                        appropriate level that, in context our continuing assessment of Syrian
                        situation, we want inform <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> of serious
                        situation we see developing as result recent Fatah incidents. Failure all
                        Arab governments to curb Fatah operations will, in our considered opinion,
                        almost certainly lead to major Israeli retaliation that could embroil area
                        as whole militarily. We are urging Israelis avoid retaliation and avail
                        selves of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> machinery, but there is limit to
                        our influence in this regard if Fatah incidents continue. We recognize
                            <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> has been making serious effort
                        control Fatah. Nevertheless, several recent incidents appear to have been
                        launched from Jordanian territory. In discussing with us <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> has taken line <gloss target="#t_SARG1">SARG</gloss> deliberately seeking involve <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> by staging Fatah incidents from Jordanian territory and

                        territory, it is under growing domestic pressure to take action. We
                        therefore urge <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> redouble efforts prevent
                        further Fatah operations from or through Jordan.<note n="5" xml:id="d327fn5">Telegram 823 from Amman, October 12, reported that Adams conveyed the
                            substance of paragraph 19 to King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> that day. The King replied, indicating that his
                            comments could be transmitted to the Israelis, that the Jordanian
                            Government was exerting maximum efforts to wipe out Fatah cells and
                            apprehend infiltrators. As a result it had arrested half a dozen Fatah
                            saboteurs in the last few days and expected to arrest more soon. Noting
                            that the Israeli side of the border south of Jerusalem was more
                            populated than the Jordanian side, he urged that the Israelis redouble
                            their efforts to patrol the common border, and he warned that if Israel
                            attacked Jordan, the Jordanian Government would have no alternative but
                            to attack. (National Archives and Records Administration, <gloss target="#t_RG1">RG</gloss> 59, Central Files 1964–66, POL 32–1

                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Vietnam.</hi> Secretary praised <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName>'s speech as constructive contribution
                        in helping focus world attention to problem of initiating process
                        negotiation. <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> indicated Israel
                        believes onus of beginning negotiations now clearly rests with Hanoi.
                        Secretary expressed doubt whether SYG would play any role in establishing
                        contact between various parties as had been suggested in <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> speech.</p>
                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Near Eastern Tour d'Horizon.</hi>
                        <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> said he had never seen Arab world
                        in such disarray. Question still remained whether <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> would settle down and confine
                        himself to <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>'s pressing internal problems.
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> had clearly not changed
                        basic objectives toward Israel, but <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
                        believed magnitude his other problems would keep him from undertaking new
                        provocations against Israel at this time. <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> characterized <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
                        relations with Lebanon and Jordan as good and felt that even with Syria
                        there was good chance of keeping conflicts localized. Israel most concerned
                        at growing Soviet influence in Syria and <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. Israeli requirements were continued effective balance of
                        strength between itself and Arab states and support of status quo by great
                        powers. Question mark is attitude of Soviets. Gromyko had recently
                        reiterated it possible for <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> have good
                        relations with both Israel and Arab states. He had also reaffirmed that
                        Soviet doctrine on non-use of force to effect territorial changes applied to
                        Near East. Secretary observed Gromyko had shown no interest in dampening
                        down arms race in area, excepting nuclear weapons.</p>
                    <p>3. <hi rend="italic">South Arabia.</hi> Secretary said US was concerned at
                        Soviet activities in southern end of Red Sea. <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> said Israel shared this concern because of Israeli
                        shipping lines through Red Sea. <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> believed
                        that after British withdrawal emergence of non-independent government in
                        south Arabia was inevitable.</p>
                    <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Palestine Refugees.</hi>
                        <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> said while refugee problem was in
                        political deadlock <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> still hoped shift
                        emphasis somewhat toward resettlement <pb n="650" xml:id="pg_650" facs="0682"/>and rehabilitation. Agreed, however, best that could be
                        hoped for this session <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> was to hold
                        line against Arab pressures. Secretary raised question of polling refugee
                        preferences. If two out of ten refugees wanted return to Israel, would they
                        be accepted? <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> jocularly said he
                        thought he could swing two in cabinet. He stressed difficulty carrying out
                        fair polling in light of Arab political “psychosis” on this issue. Secretary
                        said nonetheless he felt it possible gnaw away at refugee problem. <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> said any Israeli commitment on refugees
                        would have to be based on knowledge of number refugees who might wish
                        return.</p>
                    <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Israeli Territorial Limits.</hi> In response Secretary
                        mention of Arab concerns over Israeli expansionism, <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> stated Israel accepts present frontiers
                        as inviolate. Arab contention Israel needs more land for economic reasons
                        not logical since Israeli economy not agricultural but closer to that of
                        Benelux countries or Switzerland. As for 3 million Soviet Jews, even if
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> opened doors wide, some would
                        choose to stay in <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, some would go to
                        countries other than Israel, and only portion would come to Israel.</p>
                    <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Soviet Jewry.</hi> Secretary said he thought Soviets
                        might move on Soviet Jewry problem if they were pressed through
                        non-governmental channels. Government-to-government approaches not likely be
                        productive since <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> considers this
                        internal matter.</p>
                    <p>7. <hi rend="italic">Southwest Africa.</hi> Secretary and <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> agreed to desirability some gesture
                        from South Africa to help head off Afro-Asian resolution and enable General
                        Assembly come up with realistic moderate resolution.</p>

                    <p>2. After expressing gratification Israel had resorted to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> instrumentalities in present case,<note n="3" xml:id="d329fn3">On October 12, Israel requested an urgent meeting of

                        <persName corresp="#p_HRA2">Hare</persName> emphasized US policy against
                        retaliatory action still holds. Any idea that failure of UNSC to take
                        effective action would justify Israel's resort to force is wrong, and it was
                        important for that to be said now instead of later.</p>
                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> acknowledged he understood US
                        views in this respect. He said he would not speculate on what action

                        effective results. He would say, however, that failure curb Fatah terrorist

                        taken by Soviets. He was nursing hope Soviets would realize seriousness of
                        situation and restrain Syrians. It would appear be in Soviet interest to

                        and <gloss target="#t_MAC1">MAC</gloss>s—<persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> said he knew of nothing. He added that as far as he

                        <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> and I finally had opportunity
                        discuss together arms control in ME at long lunch session on Nov 2. Having
                        heard me out on Secretary's oral message contained <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> made following points:</p>
                    <pb n="655" xml:id="pg_655" facs="0687"/>
                    <p>A. He had not for moment thought that lack of reference this subject at his
                        Oct 7 meeting with Secretary indicated any loss of interest on our part.</p>
                    <p>B. <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> too has put considerable thought on
                        this matter. As reflected in Raphael Nov 2 speech in New York <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> stands solidly behind anti-proliferation
                        treaty and will give it active public and moral support.</p>
                    <p>C. From all evidence available to <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>, Egypt
                        now fairly relaxed as to Israeli intentions re nuclear weapons.</p>
                    <p>D. In fact, <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> has been convinced by President
                        Johnson that effort keep <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
                        uncertain as to Israeli intentions is no longer worth risk of Egyptian
                        weapons escalation.</p>
                    <p>E. However, due Egyptian predilection for sabotage and plotting, <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> must find middle ground between letting
                        Egyptians be assured <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> not manufacturing
                        bombs and giving them full info as to Israel's scientific nuclear
                        facilities.</p>
                    <p>F. Therefore, <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> cannot accept <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> system of controls to which Egyptians
                        have access at all levels and, furthermore, it wishes be sure we (and
                        presumably others) do not pass on to Egyptians specifics as to location or
                        functions of Israeli installations.</p>
                    <p>G. Possibility remains that some kind of political controls can be worked out
                        but recent Egyptian speech in Vienna makes Israelis less convinced of
                        Egyptian willingness.</p>
                    <p>H. Israelis too have hopes of being included in general non-proliferation
                        treaty before long which they would prefer to being singled out in some
                        special arrangement in way contrary Israel's sovereign status.</p>
                    <p>2. I pointed out that treaty not yet a reality and, much as we all support
                        it, we do not know when it will be. Furthermore, this being imperfect world,
                        Israeli gesture to assure its suspicious neighbors that it not moving toward
                        nuclear weapons would promote peace of area. Acceptance of <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> controls would be best way accomplish
                        this. I suggested that although my instructions did not go this far, if
                        Israel cannot see its way clear accept these, verification scheme including
                        Israel and Egypt with third country is another possibility. Still another
                        which would have advantage of being unilateral act of sovereign state would

                            from Tel Aviv, November 13, that Foreign Ministry Assistant Director
                            General Bitan gave him a message that the Israeli Government wanted to

                            morning.<note n="3" xml:id="d332fn3">An Israeli force including tanks
                            and jet aircraft conducted a large-scale raid on villages in the Hebron
                            area early on November 13.</note> As we have said frequently, we cannot
                        agree to or condone such retaliatory action. Moreover, timing of action
                        particularly embarrassing to King, who this morning <pb n="657" xml:id="pg_657" facs="0689"/>is host to President Ayub. This retaliation
                        coming a few days after the U.S. made a major effort over weeks of
                        deliberation in the Security Council puts us in a particularly difficult
                        position. Action can only make objective which we, Israelis and Jordanians
                        alike seek of putting end to border raids more difficult to achieve. It will
                        (a) place heavy domestic and external political strain on King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>'s regime; (b) raise pressures for
                        more militant posture toward Israel; (c) make much more difficult or
                        impossible <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss>'s carrying out anti-terrorist
                        campaign in Palestinian areas of Jordan.</p>
                    <p>2. We deplore terror attacks inside Israel and recognize domestic pressures
                        for action created but we do not agree that incidents in which three Israeli
                        soldiers killed left <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> with no recourse
                        except retaliatory military action across <gloss target="#t_ADL1">ADL</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>3. We are not willing deliver Israel's message to King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>. We have served as intermediary
                        between Israel and Jordan in the interests of peace—not in the interests of
                        facilitating or explaining Israel's policy of retaliation. Given
                        extraordinary efforts <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> root out terrorist
                        nets of which we have kept Israel informed, our relaying message now could
                        connote to Jordanians some justification in our minds for Israeli action.
                        That action has seriously undermined credibility our efforts exert
                        restraining influence, particularly in Jordan. We suggest Israelis pass
                        sanitized explanation for raid to Jordan through General <persName corresp="#p_BLGO1">Bull</persName> or <gloss target="#t_UNSYG1">UNSYG</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>4. You should note our feeling that moral and diplomatic support Israel
                        garnered by recent Security Council debate has now been seriously affected.
                        Those Afro-Asians and others who viewed Israel's restraint favorably and
                        recognized terrorism resulted primarily from Syria's irresponsibility will
                        undoubtedly take less sympathetic view Israeli case. Syria, for its part,
                        can take comfort from Israeli strike against Jordan citing it as vindication
                        SARG claim of non-responsibility for terrorist activities.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>I'm not suggesting our usual admonition against retaliation. We'll maintain
                        that posture, but I can sympathize with the Israelis' answer that they can't
                        ignore increasing cross-border raids of Arab terrorists which generate
                        strong pressures on the Israeli government to defend its border citizens.
                        The coalition government can't stand up indefinitely to these pressures.</p>
                    <p>But retaliation is not the point in this case. This 3000-man raid with tanks
                        and planes was out of all proportion to the provocation and was aimed at the
                        wrong target.</p>
                    <p>In hitting Jordan so hard, the Israelis have done a great deal of damage to
                        our interests and to their own:</p>
                    <p>—They've wrecked a good system of tacit cooperation between <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> and the Israelis. We had his tacit
                        agreement to keep his armor off the west bank of the Jordan, and he had made
                        an honest effort to round up terrorists in Jordan. Continuing this kind of
                        cooperation will be all but impossible now.</p>
                    <p>—They've undercut <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>. We've spent
                        $500 million to shore him up as a stabilizing factor on Israel's longest
                        border and vis-a-vis Syria and Iraq. Israel's attack increases the pressure
                        on him to counter attack not only from the more radical Arab governments and
                        from the Palestinians in Jordan but also from the Army, which is his main
                        source of support and may now press for a chance to recoup its Sunday
                        losses.</p>
                    <pb n="659" xml:id="pg_659" facs="0691"/>
                    <p>—They've set back progress toward a long term accommodation with the Arabs.
                        It makes even the moderate Arabs feel fatalistically that there is nothing
                        they can do to get along with the Israelis no matter how hard they try. It
                        puts a premium on extreme Arab chauvinism.</p>
                    <p>—They may have persuaded the Syrians, who are the main troublemakers, that
                        Israel didn't dare attack Soviet-protected Syria but could attack US-backed
                        Jordan with impunity.</p>
                    <p>It's important that we strengthen the hand of those within the Israeli
                        Government who feel this is not the proper way to handle the problem. Even
                        members of the Israeli military now doubt that retaliation will stop the
                        cross-border raids, though they see no better solution.</p>
                    <p>We've already laid the groundwork for a sharp reaction, but this by itself
                        doesn't go far enough. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> issued a statement in New York deploring the
                            attack.<note n="4" xml:id="d333fn4">The text of the statement issued by

                        with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>:</p>
                    <p>—You could send a message to <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>
                        restating our interests and making clear that Israel has undercut those
                        interests as well as its own.</p>
                    <p>—We could leak the main points of such a message to the press or in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> corridors to rebalance our image with the
                        moderate Arabs.</p>
                    <p>—We could slow down military deliveries to Israeli inconspicuously but just
                        enough to make our point. Vietnam priorities could be an overt excuse.</p>
                    <p>—We might begin putting out the line with our Jewish friends here that the US
                        can't go on supporting Israel's interests in the Middle East unless the
                        Israelis themselves show some intent over the long run to reach an
                        accommodation with the Arabs. This, after all, is what we are trying to do
                        with the Indians and Pakistanis.</p>
                    <p>—The most constructive thing we could do looking to the future would be to
                        offer help either through the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> or
                        bilaterally to make available the latest techniques in border security. Many
                        new simple devices have been successful in Vietnam and have been available
                        on the open market.</p>
                    <pb n="660" xml:id="pg_660" facs="0692"/>
                    <p>This is delicate business, but you've put a high priority on finding new ways
                        to get at the Arab-Israeli stalemate. This kind of Israeli move makes
                        progress impossible. We've felt that, with <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName>'s appointment, the winds in Israel might begin to shift
                        away from the old timers' idea of “fortress Israel” to the younger men's
                        hopes for some kind of break in the impasse. We ought to come down on the
                        side of accommodation where we can. If we don't this time, no one will ever
                        believe we care.</p>

                    <p>85342. Subj: Israel-Jordan.</p>
                    <p>1. Israeli <gloss target="#t_Amb1">Amb</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> called on Asst Sec <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> Nov 15 to discuss Israel-Jordan
                            <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> case.</p>
                    <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> said Nov 11 mining incident
                        was great shock to <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> which found no link
                        between it and Syria but considerable evidence pointing to unruly elements
                        in Hebron area who were cocking fists at everybody including <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss>, and
                        Israel. He said <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> had to consider the
                        results if it did nothing and allowed these elements to operate with
                        complete impunity. He denied retaliation was <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> objective and asked what Israel could do in situation where
                        people were unsafe in their homes and on roads. We have no objectives
                        against <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss>, he said, if they leave us
                        alone, we will leave them alone.</p>
                    <p>3. <gloss target="#t_Amb1">Amb</gloss> said Israel wanted to avoid loss of
                        life but operation didn't go according to plan when Jordan Legion appeared
                        on scene.</p>
                    <p>4. He expressed hope our purposes for future could follow along common lines.
                        Specifically a) that <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> would regard Nov 13 incident as end not
                        beginning of something; and b) a common position in <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>5. Re latter point, he said unbalanced treatment could have very bad and far
                        reaching results in area. If after getting only watered down and vetoed
                        resolution in SC against Syria <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> now gets
                        knocked down for this attack, psychological and practical results in area
                        would be disastrous. He made special plea against invidious comparisons
                        between official and open acts by <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> and
                        what Arabs claim were acts by “unofficial” bodies. He said Israel also could
                        indulge in “unofficial” strikes if it wished to. <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> hopes attempt will be made in <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> and in area to make last weekend the end and not beginning
                        of something and that SC does not take action which lends encouragement to
                        acts which led to present situation.</p>
                    <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> said we are dismayed by
                        Israeli attack. He said we thought both <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                        and <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> made out very well in Nov 4 <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> case and noted <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> presented situation effectively to Israeli press and
                        people. He recalled our repeated urging against retaliation strikes and
                        noted our concern over the magnitude of <gloss target="#t_IDF1">IDF</gloss>
                        action.</p>
                    <pb n="662" xml:id="pg_662" facs="0694"/>
                    <p>8. Frankly, <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> continued, we do not
                        understand why you chose to attack Jordan since we both know Government of
                        Jordan was trying to control terrorism and Syria was the chief culprit.</p>
                    <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> said <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> is afraid this is not the end but the beginning. We are
                        worried about effect of this situation on King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> and his government. He noted a) disarray in <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss>; b) disaffection in Jordan army on which
                        King depends; c) consequent uncertainties of <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> future policies; d) pressure on King to accept <gloss target="#t_PLA1">PLA</gloss> unit which he has stoutly resisted in past;
                        e) likely strong demand for arms by <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> with
                        resultant arms escalation.</p>
                    <p>10. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> noted US policies based on
                        King and Israeli attack may be the beginning of the deterioration of that
                        whole policy—a matter of deep concern and mutual interest to both <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>11. Our primary concern he explained is what we can do to shore up King's
                        position and this concern is bound to have important ramifications on what
                        we do in <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>12. <gloss target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss> officer present then read <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> sections of Amman's 1118<note n="2" xml:id="d335fn2">Telegram 1118 from Amman, November 15, reported
                            increased popular discontent and criticism of the Jordanian Government
                            because of the Israeli raid. (Ibid.)</note> and commented that these
                        reports indicated most serious anti-regime sentiments in recent times, even
                        worse than April 1963. He noted <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> said
                        attack was against terrorists but King and <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> considered the attack against him and his regime. He said
                        we had report directly from King noting his disillusionment and his belief
                        his whole policy called into question.<note n="3" xml:id="d335fn3">In
                            telegram 1105 from Amman, November 14, <persName corresp="#p_BFJ2">Burns</persName> reported a meeting with the King in which he spoke
                            along these lines. (Ibid.)</note> DeptOff noted it would take time for
                        us to reestablish our relations with King and <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>'s relation with King through us.</p>
                    <p>13. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> then concluded: <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> should expect two things in Council a) very
                        strong statement by us and b) strong resolution. When <gloss target="#t_Amb1">Amb</gloss> asked if it would be completely unbalanced,
                            <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> said he did not wish to go
                        beyond that at this time.</p>
                    <p>14. <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> returned to his principal
                        theme that Israel could not be expected to stand by and to permit
                        provocations against them and killing of its own citizens without
                        responding. He also emphasized pattern and series of past incidents.
                            <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> said he fully appreciated
                        that raid does not represent isolated incident and that serious problem has
                        arisen as result pattern of incidents over previous weeks and months.
                        However, fact is that recent large-scale retaliatory raid has given new
                        dimension to problem. Situation could evolve in such way that King would be
                        seriously weakened, which is neither in interest of US nor <pb n="663" xml:id="pg_663" facs="0695"/>
                        <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>. We would have to take this fact
                        particularly into account as we determined course of action in <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Warning the Israelis.</hi> I promptly called Abe Feinberg
                        to pass the blunt word that Israel was “going too far” in striking Jordan
                        and had better lay off. Feinberg was quite receptive, and said he'd just had
                        a meeting with Jack Herzog of <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>'s office, who admitted that the

                        blow 40 houses.” I replied that they should have thought of such risks
                        before they acted, not after.</p>
                    <p>Feinberg asked if he should call <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName>. I told him I'd do that myself, but that you hoped he as
                        a special friend would get the word direct to <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> through his own channels. He agreed to do so.</p>
                    <p>I gave Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> the same pitch
                        this morning, stressing that I was speaking privately and unofficially. I
                        added that, while I was no longer up on Arab-Israeli affairs, it seemed to
                        me that Israel's ill-considered and grossly excessive strike might have
                        utterly disproportionate repercussions in Jordan. Moreover, how could we
                        supply tanks to Israel if it was going to use such armor against Jordan, and
                        after we'd asked the Jordanians at Israel's request to keep their armor out
                        of the frontier zone Israel had now struck. I told <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> that in the event of any more such
                        strikes we were determined to “reexamine” our supply of arms of Israel,
                        regardless of whether contracts had been signed or not. The Israelis had put
                        in jeopardy our whole policy of promoting Arab-Israel stability by
                        subsidizing an independent Jordan.</p>
                    <p>I asked <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> not to give me the
                        standard reply, as I was no longer in the business. But he did ask me to
                        convey privately to you that <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>
                        was under heavy pressure “from his own conscience,” because as <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> and Defense Minister he couldn't even assure
                        his own people that they could travel safely in their own country or sleep
                        safely <pb n="664" xml:id="pg_664" facs="0696"/>in their own homes at night.
                        If Israel didn't strike back when repeatedly provoked, other Arabs besides
                        those in Hebron might conclude that it was “a sitting duck.”</p>
                    <p>I told <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> that you fully understood
                        Israel's problems, but that use of force was dubious at best and use of such
                        disproportionate force—against Jordan to boot—was folly indeed. It
                        undermined the whole US effort to maintain Jordanian stability, which was so
                        much in Israel's own interest that Israel's action was almost
                        incomprehensible.</p>

                    <p>The King <hi rend="italic">in a private session [less than 1 line of source
                            text not declassified]</hi> made it clear that he considers the
                        unwritten agreement with Israel which had neutralized the Jordan-Israel
                        border has “now been permanently shattered.” He feels the only way he can
                        discharge his obligation to his people is to beef up his military
                        establishment with new equipment—hopefully from the US but from “the devil
                        himself” if need be. He admits this buildup will cost Jordan much in both
                        material and human resources.</p>
                    <p>The Embassy fears that the monarchy itself is in jeopardy. While the King
                        says he will not counter-attack unless Israel attacks again, the <pb n="665" xml:id="pg_665" facs="0697"/>pressure among his populace and junior
                        officers to strike back is mounting. The Syrian radio is urging his junior
                        officers to push him aside.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Embassy Amman feels we must</hi> (a) support a strong

                        suspension of our military aid and sales to Israel.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">State is pressing the following actions in the next
                        few days:</p>
                    <p>—<gloss target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_IO1">IO</gloss>
                        have recommended a resolution that condemns Israel without mentioning the
                        sabotage incidents. <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>'s speech
                        today did condemn Israel but <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>
                        so far has not bought the <gloss target="#t_IO1">IO</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss> recommendation on the resolution.</p>
                    <p>—If we confirm Jordanian charges that US Patton tanks were used in the
                        Israeli attack, we will almost certainly have to suspend further shipments
                        to Israel. Most of the tanks have gone, but we still have 80–85% of the
                        refitting kits. Also, the Israelis have urgently requested some ammunition
                        and we can be clumsy about meeting their demands on that.</p>
                    <p>—Letters from the President to both <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>.
                        The question is whether to wait till we have a clearer long-term position or
                        to get something out quickly and follow up later.</p>
                    <p>—State is developing a series of graded actions for suspending military aid:
                        delay one ammunition order this month; slow down the whole pipeline;
                        temporarily suspend all aid and credits; and cancel.</p>
                    <p>These moves are all good tactical ones in the heat of this post-strike week.
                        However, we ought to begin facing now the basic question of what kind of
                        relationship between Israel and Jordan we can rebuild. We'll either have to
                        give in to <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>'s expensive new
                        arms requests or try to rebuild what the King today feels is “permanently
                        shattered.”</p>
                    <p>Our vote is to tackle the Israelis along these lines: They've wiped the slate
                        clean by this attack and laid low the impressive tacit arrangement we've
                        built over the years to neutralize the Israeli-Jordan border. They've
                        probably wiped out the King's commitment not to station his army on the west
                        bank. They've destroyed the running dialogue we had on controlling the
                        cross-border terrorism. The King will shortly ask us for substantial
                        quantities of military equipment and if we don't provide it, says he will go
                        anywhere he can get it. So the Israelis have left us with a tremendous bill
                        on our hands. We'd be entirely justified in suspending all aid to Israel
                        simply to offset that bill. However, we'd like to try rebuilding what we can
                        of the old tacit arrangement with Jordan. To do that, we need to know what
                        we can count on from Israel. For instance, can we tell King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> we have a commitment <pb n="666" xml:id="pg_666" facs="0698"/>from Israel not to strike again? Will
                        Israel help build up the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> border-control
                        system? If the Israelis are interested in this kind of arrangement, we will
                        do what we can with the King.</p>
                    <p>State is not thinking clearly in these terms yet because it's still
                        struggling with the details of our immediate reaction. Therefore, we should
                        begin talking in these slightly longer range terms. One way to do this would
                        be to ask for draft Presidential letters to both parties within a week
                        designed to lay the groundwork for this kind of rebuilding.</p>

                    <p>1. The 13 November Israeli raid on the Hebron district of Jordan has
                        shattered the modus vivendi which had lasted for several years along the
                        Israeli-Jordan border. During this period, King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> had made a sustained effort to avoid provocations to
                        Israel. This has involved such steps as preventing Arab saboteurs from
                        crossing from Jordan into Israel and keeping his armored forces east of the
                        Jordan River. These measures have been politically unpopular at home and
                        have subjected him to criticism from other Arab states.</p>
                    <p>2. Hence, <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> is particularly
                        bitter at the size of the attack and the damage it caused. He feels he has
                        been betrayed by an assault out of all proportion to the provocation. He has
                        been—and would be—able to live with an occasional night-time foray by
                        Israeli forces resulting in the destruction of, say, a police station and a
                        few houses. However, the recent raid involved an infantry brigade supported
                        by armor, aircraft, and artillery; it resulted in about 50 deaths—half of
                        them Jordanian soldiers—and in the destruction of about 150 buildings.
                        Jordan's army was clearly humiliated in the process.</p>
                    <pb n="667" xml:id="pg_667" facs="0699"/>
                    <p>3. The Israeli attack badly damaged <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>'s position at home. It made him vulnerable to attack
                        by disaffected elements of his population, who argue that his policy of
                        peaceful coexistence with Israel has been dictated by the US and has proved
                        a failure. There is a glaring contrast between Israeli treatment of Jordan
                        and of Syria, which had severely provoked the Israelis, had received public
                        Soviet support, and had been left alone by Tel Aviv's army. The Palestine
                        Liberation Organization (<gloss target="#t_PLO1">PLO</gloss>)<note n="3" xml:id="d338fn3">The <gloss target="#t_PLO1">PLO</gloss> is a radical
                            organization, established by agreement of the Arab rulers during the
                            recently-ended period of Arab harmony. It is strongly supported by the
                                <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, which grants it extensive radio
                            and other privileges. [Footnote in the source text.]</note> is now
                        redoubling its pressure for the establishment of Palestinian military units
                        in Jordanian border villages, a move <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> has resisted because such units would not be under
                        his control. The pressures in the Jordanian Armed Forces for retaliation
                        against Israel are very high.</p>
                    <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> is aware that such feelings
                        exist and will probably try to propitiate both military and civilian
                        elements by stationing significant army units, including armor, on the West
                        Bank of the Jordan River. He may also make a political gesture such as
                        changing his Prime Minister. <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>
                        probably feels he cannot for the present use his security forces to prevent
                        Syrian-trained saboteurs from operating through Jordan into Israel. The
                        result will probably be an increase in sabotage incidents, which in turn may
                        result in further major Israeli retaliations. Should such a raid occur in
                        the next few months, <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> would
                        almost certainly feel compelled to retaliate, although he would probably try
                        to keep Jordanian military action on a limited scale. He is aware that
                        retaliation carries the risk of an expanded conflict, which could involve
                        the bulk of his army, a process in which the latter would almost certainly
                        be defeated.</p>
                    <p>5. The Israeli raid has caused extensive grumbling and discontented talk
                        directed at the regime, but only one demonstration so far—at Hebron on 15
                        November. Emotions are running high, however—this is the worst single
                        incident since Suez—and there could be disturbances in major towns and
                        cities in Jordan. It would be particularly difficult for the regime to
                        control demonstrations directed against Israel, and they could easily be
                        diverted against the King. In this superheated atmosphere the prospects for
                        an attempted coup or assassination cannot be ruled out.</p>
                    <p>6. The reactions of Jordan's Arab neighbors have been mixed. The Syrians have
                        severely criticized <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> for
                        failing to deal strongly with Israel, but Cairo has been very restrained.
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> is aware that if <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> retaliated with a military strike
                        at Israel, Cairo could be faced with a choice of coming to Jordan's support
                        or of losing much prestige <pb n="668" xml:id="pg_668" facs="0700"/>by
                        staying aloof. The Syrians, on the other hand, can be expected to continue
                        to train saboteurs and dispatch them to Israel through Jordan. They are
                        intent upon causing trouble in both countries.</p>
                    <p>7. Even if the Jordanian regime gets through the immediate crisis, <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>'s position appears to have been
                        damaged to an extent we cannot yet fully assess. He [<hi rend="italic">less
                            than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] and even at his best
                        probably commands the allegiance of not more than a quarter to a third of
                        the population. Hence, the regime's continuity requires that it not suffer
                        too many public defeats in close succession. Failure of the regime to
                        respond militarily to incidents occurring in the near future would almost
                        certainly stimulate more determined plotting within the Armed Forces as well
                        as widespread public disorder.</p>
                    <p>8. For some time, <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> will feel
                        compelled to take a harder line toward Israel. He will be forced into a
                        military buildup, both for greater border security and to keep the military
                        happy. He will certainly turn to the US for more military hardware and
                        faster delivery. He will seek and probably get Saudi money to buy arms. If
                        he does not obtain substantial help from these sources and if internal
                        pressures increase, he will try to repair his relations with the radical
                        Arab states and may turn to the Soviets for economic aid and possibly for
                        arms. Tension along the border will almost certainly remain high, incidents
                        are likely to be frequent, and <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>'s future will to a great degree depend on the scope
                        and nature of Syrian and Israeli initiatives in this respect. <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> himself is most unlikely to
                        approach the question of Israeli-Jordanian relations as openmindedly and as
                        positively as he has in the past.</p>
                    <p>9. The Israeli raid seems illogical and miscalculated to us, and there is
                        evidence that it seems so to some segments of opinion in Israel as well. On
                        the whole, and in the absence of further evidence, we think it most likely
                        that the Israeli act was one of genuine retaliation, determined to be
                        necessary to satisfy Israeli opinion, and (in the Israeli view) to throw
                        fear into the Arabs and restrain them from further forays into Israel. As
                        for why the Israelis attacked Jordan instead of Syria, one major concern was
                        the greater military costs of an incursion into Syria. A decision was
                        probably made some weeks ago to stage a major raid into Jordan as soon as a
                        pretext arose. It also appears likely that Israel wished to avoid attacking
                        Syria because of Syria's close relations with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and Israel's desire not to worsen relations with that
                        great power, especially in view of the large Jewish population in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>

                    <p> CAP 661007. The Israel-Jordan border situation remains explosive. Last
                        Sunday's raid weakened King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>'s
                        ability to control terrorists operating into Israel from Jordan because he
                        no longer has full cooperation of the army, which Israel badly mauled.<note n="2" xml:id="d339fn2">Telegram 1173 from Amman, November 19, reported

                            strong Security Council resolution condemning Israel, delivery of
                            certain defensive weapons to Jordan, beginning as soon as possible, and

                            (Ibid.)</note> Another Israeli strike in retaliation for new incidents
                        that could happen would force <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>
                        to counter attack.</p>
                    <p>I. Our first job, therefore, is to keep Israel from attacking again.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> recommends a tough
                        message to <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> which says we would
                        have to reassess our last year's decision to supply military equipment if
                        Israel attacks again. Since we have already sent a number of tough signals,
                        he hesitates to recommend unqualifiedly that you send this message and
                        volunteers to deliver it himself via <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> if you prefer. (The last paragraph is our suggestion
                        to which working levels at state are agreeable. There has been no time to
                        get it to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>.)</p>
                    <p>I recommend you send it yourself for Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Barbour</persName> to pass orally to <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> for three reasons:</p>
                    <p>1. Sunday's attack badly damaged our ability to go on stabilizing Israel's
                        Jordanian border. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName>
                        now understands this, but we're not sure Israeli leaders in Jerusalem do.
                        Asking <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Barbour</persName> to deliver it there
                        will have greater impact. The Israelis have gravely damaged the unspoken
                        truce we've helped them build with <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>—including possibly the agreement in return for our
                        plane and tank sale not to station Jordanian armor on the West Bank of the
                        Jordan near Israel. They've upset your delicate and successful balancing act
                        in selling jets to Jordan to keep the Soviets out. He is now reported to be
                        receiving Soviet equipment offers and is making requests to us for
                        substantial additional equipment. The Israelis must be made to realize <pb n="670" xml:id="pg_670" facs="0702"/>that if they retaliate again, in
                        response to anything short of a major attack, our ability to stabilize the
                        area may be crippled.</p>
                    <p>2. Bringing home to them that they've undercut your policies will strengthen
                        your hand for whatever we may have to ask Israel to do later to re-stabilize
                        the situation.</p>
                    <p>3. We also want to use this opening to jolt Israeli leaders into realizing
                        that they can't go on looking to us for protection over the long haul unless
                        they make some effort of their own to coexist with their neighbors. In view
                        of your stance that reconciliation not aggression is the way to solve
                        problems, we can't miss this opportunity to challenge a policy that is
                        leading us all up a dead-end street in the Middle East. Many of Israel's new
                        leaders doubt that the old retaliation policy of Ben Gurion is wise and
                        believe Israel can only survive by working toward accommodation with the
                        Arabs. Their bad mistake last weekend will sharpen debate over this issue.
                        This message from you laid before <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> personally would bring them up short and may help the
                        moderates turn the corner.</p>
                    <p>II. Our second job is to put <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>
                        back on his feet. His regime has been severely shaken and he has asked us
                        for substantial additional amounts of military equipment. He wants some of
                        it to be airlifted for dramatic impact to undercut critics who charge that
                        he is incompetent to defend Jordan. We do not want to feed his belief that
                        his only response is to build a defense establishment he cannot afford, but
                        we will have to try to meet his problem of demonstrating to his people that
                        he's doing all he can.</p>
                    <p>One way to do this is to speed up a few items in the military aid pipeline.
                        We don't like this, but the alternative again is to stand by and watch the
                        Egyptians and Soviets happily pour the stuff in. The sensible long-term
                        approach is to send a mission or possibly missions to work out effective
                        ways to seal off the Israel-Jordan border. That's the real problem, and the
                        sooner we divert his attention to that, the better. I suggested the idea to
                        Secretaries <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>. They are exploring possibilities
                        along these lines.</p>
                    <p>If we speed up Jordan's pipeline, we will have to tell Israel why and ask
                        them to restrain critics here. We would also have to offer similar
                        border-control help to Israel because, in all fairness, they can only give
                        up retaliation if they find some other way to deal with Arab terrorists.</p>
                    <p>We will push staff work on this today and be back to you quickly with a
                        concrete response to <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>. But the
                        most immediate need is to restrain Israel and lay a strong bargaining base
                        for whatever long-range scheme we can work out.</p>
                    <p>I also think it would be a good idea for me to spell out our thinking to
                        Feinberg as soon as we have ourselves lined up. We may have to <pb n="671" xml:id="pg_671" facs="0703"/>look like we're making some anti-Israeli
                        gestures before we're done, and a little pre-emptive briefing might
                        help.</p>

                            note: “this message as his own to <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> &amp; you inform Feinberg of contents

                            were relayed to <persName>Rostow</persName> by telephone from the <gloss target="#t_LBJ1">LBJ</gloss> Ranch at 8 a.m. on November 21. The

                    </p>
                    <p> “You are aware of our concern at the events of November 13 and their impact
                        on the stability of the regime in Jordan. I am sympathetically aware of the
                        painful dilemma posed by your need both to protect Israel's citizens and to
                        promote peace with your neighbors. Just two weeks ago we made our position
                        on terror incidents mounted from across your border clear beyond question in
                        the Security Council hearings on your complaint against Syria. But while
                        recognizing your problem, I must recognize also that the fact of the raid on
                        Jordan and its magnitude have raised threats to United States interests and,
                        I believe, to those of Israel.</p>
                    <p>Sunday's raid has set in motion developments in Jordan the outcome of which
                        at this juncture we cannot fully assess. But the position of King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>'s government and United States
                        interests have been gravely affected. Another such action, no matter what
                        the cause, could bring on irreparable damage. The implications of such
                        action for Israel's security and for area stability would therefore be
                        serious indeed.</p>
                    <p>Continued application of the policy of military retaliation by Israel raises
                        concern here as to the supply of some categories of United States military
                        equipment to Israel. You will recall that it was only after exhaustive
                        consideration of the military situation in the Middle East that we agreed
                        last year to an exception to our long-standing policy on arms sales. This
                        decision was not easily arrived at. It was taken in <pb n="672" xml:id="pg_672" facs="0704"/>the belief that it would contribute to
                        stability in the area. In full candor, I must make certain you are aware
                        that further punitive forays by Israel across armistice lines in the Near
                        East could bring a reassessment of the premises on which our decisions
                        regarding military supply to Israel were based.</p>
                    <p>These are troubled times, Mr. Prime Minister, when peace is fragile and
                        stability more necessary than ever. Just as there have been events that
                        disturb the peace, there may be in the future more such events. In these
                        circumstances it is the hardest and highest task of government to hold fast
                        to course of moderation and reason. It is because I know you share with me
                        these views that I know I can count on you not only to recognize the peril
                        but also to have the determination to avoid it.</p>
                    <p>Beyond this present situation, there is also the need to look toward Israel's
                        eventual coexistence with its neighbors. I well know from my own country's
                        experience along its long borders how difficult—but also how essential—this
                        is. It has also been part of our experience that out of a crucible such as
                        the present crisis can come small but sound steps toward a more stable and
                        secure future.”</p>

                        discussions in New York on Security Council resolution. He stressed two
                        points in particular: (a) that we disabuse members of the Security Council
                        that in final analysis we would support original Nigerian text; and (b) that
                        regardless of what the United States might think about the retaliatory
                        Israeli action against Jordan, the important thing was peace in the Middle
                        East and that a completely one-sided Security Council resolution would only
                        add to sense of demoralization and frustration in Israel.</p>

                        in such a way as to promote peace in the area. We have suggested changes in
                        Nigerian draft to give it better balance. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> promised to convey above views expressed by <persName corresp="#p_EE1">Evron</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> on Monday.</p>

                    <p>1. A New York lawyer for ALCO, Mr. James Birdsall, has recently reported to
                        Department substance of a lengthy conversation he had with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> in Cairo on October 12.<note n="2" xml:id="d341fn2">
                            <persName corresp="#p_HRA2">Hare</persName>'s November 10 memorandum
                            states that Birdsall's memorandum of the conversation (not found) had
                            been shown to and discussed with James Critchfield of the Central
                            Intelligence Agency, who state that “<gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
                            is involved in no operations in the area which could in any way be
                            interpreted by the Egyptians as 'evidence' of the kind they claim they
                            have.” <persName corresp="#p_HRA2">Hare</persName> noted that although
                            it was highly unusual for a Chief of State to communicate through a
                            private individual, <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> had
                            since 1952 had significant conversations with prominent but non-official
                            Americans such as Robert Anderson. <persName corresp="#p_HRA2">Hare</persName> thought they should take <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s statements seriously and act
                            on the assumption that he would expect a response.</note> Main thrust of
                        conversation was reaffirmation of desire maintain good relations with US,
                        arguments aimed at demonstrating that US and <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> had many common interests in area and request that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> exert new initiative to resolve Yemen
                        impasse. There was strong plea for resumption PL 480 wheat shipments <pb n="674" xml:id="pg_674" facs="0706"/>and expectable indications of what
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> and <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> would do to be helpful if wheat
                        forthcoming. Disturbing element was <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s statement to Birdsall that within last 18 months to
                        two years he had become convinced that US determined overthrow his
                        government and possibly go so far as to assassinate him. He added that “he
                        had indisputable evidence that within the last several months agents of the
                            <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> had entered into a conspiracy with
                        Egyptians aimed at his assassination and violent overthrow of his
                        government.” He said he would be prepared to disclose evidence and to
                        discuss matter with any representative of <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>2. In same conversation <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, while
                        not accusing you of being active participant in any “plot,” said he had no
                        evidence that you not aware of plot. Birdsall's answers were responsible,
                        forthright, and adroit. He refused as private citizen examine any so-called
                        “evidence” and said only he would convey <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s concern to <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>.
                        Problem of <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> suspicions of <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> intentions is one with which both you and
                        we have been wrestling for many months. We have no illusions that any single
                        action on our part can in itself reestablish new atmosphere of mutual
                        evidence. At same time we feel that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s open-ended offer disclose “evidence” to a <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> official carries with it an opportunity
                        that should not be cast aside.</p>
                    <p>3. I believe it would be appropriate, unless you perceive serious objection,
                        for you to see <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> to make
                        following points:</p>
                    <p>a. It has been brought to attention of <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                        that reports have reached the highest levels of the <gloss target="#t_GUAR1">GUAR</gloss> to the effect that the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                        is involved in an alleged “plot” to interfere directly in the internal
                        affairs of the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> in opposition to
                        President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> and his
                        government.</p>
                    <p>b. You have been personally authorized by me to deny categorically the
                        authenticity of such reports and to assure <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> that the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has no
                        intention or desire to interfere in the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>'s internal affairs.</p>
                    <p>c. I want President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> to know of
                        my concern at this indication of an obstacle to confidence between our two
                        Governments and my belief that it is to the interest of both countries that
                        this matter be expeditiously dealt with.</p>
                    <p>d. I believe that these reports and accompanying material should be subjected
                        to joint scrutiny by competent intelligence technicians from the US and the
                        UAR. I would like to send a high-ranking and responsible official of the
                        Central Intelligence Agency to Cairo to discuss this matter with the
                        appropriate <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> authorities and carefully to
                        examine and comment on any material which the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> may wish to make available to him. [<hi rend="italic">2

                    <p>e. The <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> would give serious consideration
                        to any alternative suggestions which President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> might care to make as we strongly desire to set the
                        record straight as quickly as possible.<note n="3" xml:id="d341fn3">

                            followed paragraphs 3a through e of telegram 88396 closely, telling

                                <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> said immediately he
                            had no feeling that <persName corresp="#p_BLD2">Battle</persName> was

                            conversation and a little flustered.” When <persName corresp="#p_BLD2">Battle</persName> pressed him to make available the evidence he had
                            mentioned, he replied that except for the Mustapha Amin case, he had not
                            had anything for perhaps 2 years. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> made numerous efforts to change the subject and
                            indicated no willingness to pursue the matter with <persName corresp="#p_BLD2">Battle</persName> or anyone else. <persName corresp="#p_BLD2">Battle</persName> thought he either had no
                            evidence or was uncertain about making it available. (National Archives

                        Israeli raid into Jordan and its impact on King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>'s position in Jordan. Secretary said we aware
                        dilemma faced by Israel in coping with terror incidents but that the raid
                        was disproportionate to problem. It was launched without consultation with
                        us although just two weeks earlier we had stood firmly with Israel in the
                        Security Council on this very problem. Israel's action has put Jordan
                        Government under heavy pressure and both our interests and Israel's have
                        been adversely affected. Secretary made clear that a recurrence of action
                        across armistice lines could bring re-examination of our decision to sell

                        Israel would seek to strengthen border security measures to prevent

                        rather than disproportionate military attacks were the answer.</p>

                        wished President to know he has ordered study be made and action be taken in
                        regard methods of improving Israel's static defense. Prime Minister stated
                        central point is that Israel's basic policy has not changed. It stands by
                        armistice agreement, supports status quo, and sovereignty and integrity of
                        existing states. Prime Minister invited understanding of President for
                        dilemma in which Israel found itself. Message closes with strong appeal for
                        US support to prevent SC resolution which utterly ignores Israel's losses,
                        anxieties and difficulties.</p>
                    <p>Following <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName>'s presentation
                        Secretary stated he still could not understand how Israel so misread
                        situation as not to realize even limited action would seriously endanger
                        Jordan Government and moderate policies it pursued. That Israel's action got
                        out of control and escalated brought to his mind three incidents where
                        escalation had or could have occurred. First occurred last year when
                        infiltrators crossed from Pakistan-held territory into Indian-held Kashmir
                        to harass area. Action taken by GOP without consultation with us brought
                        move into Pakistan-held territory by Indian forces, again without
                        consultation with us. Rate of escalation such we had no means to use our
                        influence with either party. When cease-fire agreement finally came we were
                        “fifteen minutes” from Congressional resolution which would have barred all
                        further aid to India and Pakistan.</p>
                    <p>In matters involving U.S. we have practiced restraint in order to avoid
                        escalation to extent possible. Despite heavy infiltration of North Viet Nam
                        forces into south we waited five years before ordering bombing of supply
                        points and routes in north. In effect, there was a five-year pause during
                        which we sought other solutions. At present, almost every week, there are
                        armed forays from Cambodia against us in Viet Nam. We know Prince Sihanouk
                        does not condone actions and that he lacks military force to prevent them.
                        Yet, because of position in which he would be put, we do not strike at our
                        enemy in Cambodian territory.</p>
                    <pb n="679" xml:id="pg_679" facs="0711"/>
                    <p>Secretary noted that recently when six U.S. soldiers killed south of
                        demilitarized zone in Korea we did not launch retaliatory action against
                        north. Restraint is essential to avoid escalation and to build up prospects
                        of peace. And yet, restraint and moderation are the most difficult of
                        postures for any government to assume.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> said Israel faces
                        most difficult problem. Terror incidents occur on doorstep rather than miles
                        away as in Kashmir. Its 800-mile frontier across extremely difficult terrain
                        is guarded by only small conscript army. Government had increased length
                        military service to make more men available for security patrols. Frontier
                        villages employing night guards at their own expense. All this created
                        “siege atmosphere” and made for most difficult way of life for Israeli
                        citizens. Arab actions seem indication of policy of total aggression.</p>
                    <p>Secretary did not agree this the case and again noted measures taken by
                        Jordan to control terror groups. He said “what you have done in the name of
                        your security seems in fact to have undermined Israel's security.”</p>

                            November 21 reiterated the Embassy's view that the action that would
                            have the maximum impact in Jordan would be an announcement of suspension
                            of military deliveries to Israel. (Ibid., POL 32–1 ISR–JORDAN)</note>

                        <hi rend="italic">Arms Deliveries to Israel</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>1. Idea of suspending or slowing down arms deliveries to Israel has much
                        appeal as possible means (a) underline to <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> our strong disapproval Nov 13 raid and retaliation doctrine
                        generally and (b) as short-term psychological measure to help bolster morale
                            <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> and <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss>. After careful consideration we have
                        concluded for number reasons that such actions, whether publicly announced
                        or privately conveyed to one or both parties, would not be wise at this
                        juncture and might in fact be counterproductive.</p>
                    <p>2. Regardless general indignation concerning nature of Israeli raid, public
                        announcement suspension of deliveries could be interpreted as slap at Israel
                        that failed to take into account context of terrorism over past two years,
                        growth of “popular liberation” sentiment in area, and alleged lack of
                        immediately effective alternatives. We also have in mind most recent reports
                        indicating Israeli forces used were on much smaller scale than originally
                        reported and that no significant, if any, US equipment was employed (Tel
                        Aviv 1742 and <gloss target="#t_USDAO1">USDAO</gloss> Amman 1703 Nov 66). In
                        addition, publicly announced suspension of arms to Israel could lead to
                        demand for same to be applied to Jordan, and perhaps to whole area. At very
                        least this could reopen previous public questioning of US sales to Israel,
                        Jordan, and Saudi Arabia, which could do considerable damage to our policy
                        interests both in short and longer run. Finally, suspension of deliveries
                        would face us with problem developing convincing rationale for their
                        ultimate resumption. Even if suspension were kept private, fact of
                        suspension would probably surface, and if terrorism and present tension
                        continue it would be difficult justify resumption unless Israelis had
                        renounced retaliation (which we judge as most unlikely).</p>
                    <p>3. Similar disadvantages and risks would apply to non-publicized actions
                        affecting Israel arms deliveries. If actions were to do any good along lines
                        para 1 (a) and (b) above, Israelis and Jordanians would have to be made
                        explicitly aware of them, and damaging, probably distorted, publicity would
                        almost inevitably result.</p>
                    <p>4. Whatever wisdom Nov 13 raid, Israel is in good position in larger context
                        to justify defense requirements and thus to argue that delays in arms
                        deliveries could jeopardize Israel's defense. If it could be demonstrated
                        Israel had violated agreements with us by using our equipment for aggression
                        there would be no question our reactions to suspend shipments. In present
                        circumstances we believe measures short of suspension such as deliberate
                        slowdown of shipments would risk strong reactions that could undercut
                        Israel's tacit agreement for recent US tank and aircraft sales to
                        Jordan.</p>
                    <p>5. In sum, in present circumstances we believe disadvantages outweigh
                        advantages of suspension of arms deliveries to Israel and are <pb n="681" xml:id="pg_681" facs="0713"/>therefore concentrating on (a) other ways

                        points,” (b) demonstrating that effective alternatives can be developed for
                        containing terrorism, and (c) finding other means to provide psychological

                            Israeli raid, stressing its impact on King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>. (Ibid.)</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>1. In mtg this afternoon, after discussing situation in <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> reported <gloss target="#t_septel1">septel</gloss>, I told <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> that I assumed there no necessity
                        for me to emphasize further the seriousness of the situation resulting from
                        the Israeli Nov 13 raid, particularly insofar as its consequences in Jordan.
                        I said that in worst event <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>'s
                        regime will be displaced and at best damage of inestimable magnitude has
                        been done to <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>'s attitude
                        toward Israel and his estimate of Israeli intentions. This situation
                        abundantly clear and I would spare him repetition.</p>
                    <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> acknowledged full comprehension
                        on part <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> now and its apprehensions. He
                        said this understandably was reason he sought mtg. Having consulted at
                        length with <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>, he wished to give some of
                            <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>'s thinking as to future. He
                        expressed confidence in and gratitude for basic foundation of US–<gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> relations. He cited help of U.S. in
                        security field and its assistance in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                        refugee and Syrian debates as components in making this a “good year” for
                        Israel and a high point in US-Israeli relations. He went on that essential
                        now is to get over <pb n="682" xml:id="pg_682" facs="0714"/>current
                        divergence. Basic factor which had been introduced into Arab-Israeli
                        confrontation in recent times was concept of “popular war.” This had given
                        scope to non-governmental terrorist organizations hitherto under wraps.
                        Attacks on Israel's capital (Romema dynamiting) and on railway between
                        capital and main city added new dimension to security problem. <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> had reacted against harborers of agents
                        involved. He admitted effect on Jordanian regime not as anticipated and
                        dangerous situation had resulted.</p>
                    <p>3. <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> has now approved as basic <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> policy the reestablishment of stability in
                        Jordan. <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> will welcome any ideas as to
                        measures which will promote this purpose. Meanwhile, <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> has ordered “maximum restraint.” This means no reaction to
                        further popularly inspired incidents. Of course, in event of major military
                        attack, <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> will defend itself. (Here
                            <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> cited report earlier today of
                        intention of commander of Jordanian brigade to take matters into own hands.
                        I replied we had report apparently on same item but markedly different in
                        most important element namely that commander in question was going to
                        petition the King for authority. This seemed to reassure him.)</p>
                    <p>4. In implementation this policy <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> will
                        endeavor first to minimize contact. Scopus convoy scheduled for tomorrow
                        will not go. Trains on Jerusalem-Tel Aviv route will not run at night.
                        Fences will be constructed in Jerusalem area at two points along railway. I
                        asked about cultivation on Syrian border in DZ. He said <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> attempting through <persName corresp="#p_BLGO1">Bull</persName> to get informal three power—Israel,
                        Syria and <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>—negotiations going to settle
                        fields on basis of status quo.</p>
                    <p>5. Of more continuing impact, <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> has
                        instructed that major effort be made to improve static defense in hope that
                        even if it impossible to seal borders entirely at least infiltration can be
                        made “less easy.” Guards will be increased and technical devices sought. Any
                        U.S. ideas will be welcome.</p>
                    <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> wondered whether U.S. had any
                        influence with Egyptians which might be utilized to assist King. Israeli
                        impression is that subversion being fomented in Nablus is PLO inspired and
                        although Shuquairy not <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> agent
                        his organization is in Egypt. I noted our stock with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> not high but it possible he also
                        might not be anxious overthrow <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> this time and might exercise moderating influence on
                        his own.</p>
                    <p>7. Finally, <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> said King could be
                        assured in firmest terms that Israeli policy as to Jordan and its
                        disinterest in acquiring West Bank has not changed. Raid was not prelude or
                        rehearsal for invasion. It merely got out of hand.</p>
                    <p>8. Conversation confirms that <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> and other
                        members <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> deeply shaken by developments.
                        Also shocked by revelation of degree of precariousness of <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> regime which, although they admit
                        we told them repeatedly, they had been unable to comprehend. They probably
                            <pb n="683" xml:id="pg_683" facs="0715"/>have further taught themselves
                        importance to Israel of Hashemite dynasty, idea which they adopted
                        intellectually but less than wholeheartedly. Lesson may be worthwhile.</p>

                    <p>Our next step in defusing the Jordan-Israel crisis is to bolster King
                            <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>. He is under great
                        pressure both from the Palestinian elements in his population and from the
                        junior army officers who charge that he has not provided adequately for
                        Jordan's defense. Demonstrations have spread to all the major centers in
                        West Jordan. He has asked us for substantial amounts of military equipment
                        to help him demonstrate that he has moved to prevent a repeat of the mauling
                        Israel gave Jordan's forces on November 13. Some of his advisors tell him
                        that only attacking Israel will win the popular support necessary to save
                        his regime.</p>
                    <p>From our point of view either of the extreme approaches Jordan officials are
                        talking about amounts to suicide. An attack on Israel could result in
                        nothing but a severe Jordanian defeat. Expanding the army to the extent the
                        King is talking about would be economic suicide because the Jordanian
                        budget—already heavily subsidized by us—could not stand the additional $20
                        million a year in normal support maintenance costs we estimate would be
                        required.</p>
                    <p>The King may still choose to commit suicide. He has told Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BFJ2">Burns</persName> that a point may come when he would
                        rather go down fighting his enemies rather than his own people. However, our
                        job is to (a) do what we can to help him through this tense period and (b)
                        to restore balance to his thinking. We are convinced—and we now have
                            <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>'s own assurances—that
                        Israel has not changed its policy toward Jordan as the King seems to
                        believe. With the gradual restoration of <pb n="684" xml:id="pg_684" facs="0716"/>calm, we hope to turn his thinking to modest efforts to
                        better control his borders.</p>
                    <p>The following message, approved by Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>, from you to the King is
                        designed to help him over the current crisis.</p>
                    <p>It expresses our sympathy to <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>,
                        makes clear our sharp disapproval of Israel's action and reaffirms our
                        interest in the peace, security, and economic progress of Jordan. It seeks
                        to allay his fears that this major raid represents a change in Israel's
                        policy toward the West Bank by indicating you have good reason to believe it
                        highly unlikely that the events he fears will in fact occur. (We have the
                        firmest assurances from Israel to this effect.) It makes clear that the
                        Israelis are fully aware that a repeat performance will have the gravest
                        consequences for U.S.-Israeli relations.</p>
                    <p>I believe we now have the Israelis focussing on better control of the
                        borders—the most necessary immediate step in launching a period of quiet in
                        Israel-Jordan relations. It will be more difficult to get <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> concentrating on this problem
                        rather than making unrealistic calls on us to make Jordan and Israel
                        militarily equal. We will also have to help him parry thrusts again from the

                        However, this message is the first step in that direction.</p>
                    <p>“Your Majesty:</p>
                    <p>Words of sympathy are small comfort when lives have been needlessly
                        destroyed. I do, however, want to convey to Your Majesty a sense of the
                        sorrow and concern the military action by Israel in the Hebron area has
                        raised in me and in this country generally. My disapproval of this action
                        has been made known to the Government of Israel in the strongest terms. Our
                        support of condemnation of this action by the Security Council and
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>'s statement
                        during the Security Council hearings demonstrate the depth of my feelings
                        and those of our country.</p>
                    <p>This action has placed Your Majesty in a difficult position. I am certain
                        that with your demonstrated courage, wisdom and moderation, your
                        difficulties will be overcome. For our part, I assure you that this
                        government maintains its interest in the peace and security of Jordan and in
                        the economic progress and well-being of its people. I have ordered an urgent
                        review of measures which the United States Government could take to assist
                        you during this difficult period.<note n="2" xml:id="d346fn2">On another

                            to read as follows: “I have ordered an urgent review of measures which
                            the United States Government could take to assist in settling these

                        Israel now intends to occupy territory on the West Bank of the Jordan River.
                        While I can understand the reasons for this concern, I have good reason to
                        believe it highly unlikely that the events you fear will in fact occur. In
                        this connection my government's opposition to the use of force to alter
                        armistice lines or borders in the Near East has been made unmistakably clear
                        to all parties concerned.</p>
                    <p>The strong private representations we have made in Israel as well as our
                        forthright public statements make clear that should Israel adopt the
                        policies you fear it would have the gravest consequences for United

                        quick response will be helpful in meeting immediate need of bolstering

                        heft, as in finding ways to improve border security, i.e., static defense.

                        “the necessity for strict adherence to the General Armistice Agreement.” The
                        resolution deplored the loss of life and property damage resulting from
                        Israel's action on November 13; censured Israel for its action; emphasized
                        to Israel that if actions of military reprisal were repeated, the Security
                        Council “will have to consider further and more effective steps as envisaged
                        in the Charter to ensure against the repetition of such acts;” and requested
                        the Secretary-General to keep the situation under review and report to the
                        Security Council as appropriate. The resolution was adopted by 14 votes to
                        0, with 1 abstention. The United States voted in favor of the

                            1966</date>.</dateline>
                    <p>At the urgent request of <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName>, I called on him yesterday
                        afternoon. He said he had asked me to come on a busy afternoon because of
                        his extreme anxiety about the drift in US–<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> relations at a time of crisis in Near Eastern affairs. He
                        had touched bases widely in the Department and in the White House without
                        tangible results. He was aware that the Secretary would leave Washington
                        December 4 for about two weeks and he feared the consequences if nothing
                        occurred during that period.</p>
                    <p>The heart of his anxiety is the stalemate on consideration of a possible
                        PL–480 agreement. Maintaining that the key to peace and stability in the
                        Near East is the continuation of effective US–<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> relations, he urged that technical discussions of the
                        PL–480 question begin before the end of the year. He pointed out that the
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> is receiving massive military and
                        economic assistance from the Communists while pursuing independent
                        nationalist policies. This was possible because a food-link was maintained
                        with the West. Kosygin had told <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">
                            <pb n="689" xml:id="pg_689" facs="0721"/>Nasser</persName> that Russia
                        would meet the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> food requirements if this
                        proved necessary. <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> believes that,
                        if this occurs, the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> will slip
                        irrevocably into the Soviet camp with dire consequences for peace and Near
                        East stability.</p>
                    <p>Despite the highly explosive situation which currently exists in the Near
                        East, <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> is confident that the area
                        can be quieted down. He claims the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> has
                        no intent to bring <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> down,
                        since this would create a very dangerous situation for everyone in the
                        area.</p>
                    <p>When I raised the Ford problem, <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName>
                        said that Ford had stupidly created the problem and that it was now
                        incumbent upon the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and US Governments,
                        as well as Ford, to resolve the issues. He said Ford assets had been blocked
                        under <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> law over a customs dispute. He had
                        been in direct contact with Ford and the company is prepared to make certain
                        payments and this issue appears negotiable. Regrettably the Arab League
                        Boycott Committee had met in the immediate aftermath of the Israeli action
                        against Jordan. Under these circumstances, no Arab Government could oppose
                        the boycott proposals of the radicals.<note n="2" xml:id="d350fn2">This
                            portion of the conversation is recorded in more detail in telegram 92233
                            to Cairo, November 28. <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName>
                            stated that the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> Government had “long
                            since” given up the notion that the Arab boycott was an effective weapon
                            against Israel. He advised against a direct U.S. assault on the boycott
                            apparatus and recommended that the companies involved take up matters
                            with individual Arab governments. (Ibid., FT 11–2 ISR ARAB) Other
                            documentation related to the boycott is ibid.</note> Nevertheless, some
                        way could be found to get around this problem. He suggested that Eugene
                        Black be authorized to raise it with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> when he sees him on December 1.</p>
                    <p>Turning to the question of the recent departmental reorganization he asserted
                        that all Arab Ambassadors concurred that the new structure and arrangements
                        were less satisfactory.</p>

                        raid and had made known in both Israel and <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>
                        our view that Israeli action was wrong and misguided.</p>
                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_KGA2">Khammash</persName> said as Chief of Staff it
                        difficult be absent from Jordan at this time, but King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> felt it important convey at high
                        level <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> view of situation and corrective
                        measures needed. Israeli raid, largest since 1956, had revealed Jordan
                        defenses inadequate and adversely affected morale of Army. He had initially
                        thought Israeli attack was beginning of invasion and had considered ordering
                        return strike. If he had, area could have been plunged into war.</p>
                    <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_KGA2">Khammash</persName> said while <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> could cope with present demonstrations,
                        they were most serious Jordan had experienced and revealed depth of popular
                        feeling. Jordan now subject propaganda attacks from Syria, <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and PLO. Public opinion in Jordan was
                        convinced Israel attacked Jordan because Syria, which Israel had earlier
                        held responsible for terrorism, was strong militarily and protected by
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. In this situation Jordan was
                        turning to its friend the United States. Must be understood that Nov 13
                        incident unlike incidents in past and situation would not return to normal
                        if nothing was done. If <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> unable to help,
                        King faced with choice of (a) dying in <persName corresp="#p_BLD2">Battle</persName> with Israel rather than at hands of own people, (b)
                        becoming hero by turning to Soviets for military equipment or (c)
                        abdicating. If Jordan received equipment requested and money to pay for
                        enlarged Army, all would be well. This connection <persName corresp="#p_KGA2">Khammash</persName> asserted Jordanian officers
                        sufficiently sophisticated to tell difference between real and token
                        help.</p>
                    <p>5. In response Secretary's question whether opinions differed between East
                        and West Bank in this matter, <persName corresp="#p_KGA2">Khammash</persName> replied sense of defeat equally strong among all
                        Jordanians. Only difference was that East Bank less vulnerable to Syrian,
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and PLO propaganda. Jordan had been
                        subject to such propaganda before but situation created by Nov 13 attack had
                        made elements of population more responsive than previously.</p>
                    <p>6. Secretary enquired re King's personal safety. <persName corresp="#p_KGA2">Khammash</persName> said King for present could depend on loyalty of
                        armed forces. If nothing done, however, Nov 13 might in time become Jordan's
                        new national day.</p>
                    <pb n="692" xml:id="pg_692" facs="0724"/>
                    <p>7. Secretary stressed he could not overstate gravity with which we viewed
                        Israeli attack. Another such attack would have most serious consequences and
                        there no doubt in Israel about this. At same time, he wanted emphasize two
                        points: in our view attack (1) did not reflect Israeli scheme to seize West

                        to foresee consequences for King.</p>
                    <p>8. Secretary continued that US has strong fraternal feeling for His Majesty
                        and interest in well being of Jordan. We would take urgent look at Jordan's
                        request. While he could not comment in detail pending consultations with
                        Defense colleagues, there was no question about our policy of support for
                        Jordan.</p>
                    <p>9. Secretary said he now frankly more concerned about Syria and <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> than Israel. Did <persName corresp="#p_KGA2">Khammash</persName> see any connection between recent

                        commented that, while we had not discussed latest incident with Soviets, we
                        had held discussions with them regarding Near East in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> context and he had discussed possibility of slow-down in
                        arms race with Gromyko. We had, however, found no interest on Soviet
                        side.</p>
                    <p>10. Secretary emphasized President deeply concerned re Israeli attack Nov 13
                        and had conveyed his views to Israel through more than one channel.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KGA2">Khammash</persName> responded that high
                            <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> officials do not doubt <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> position but Jordan public disillusioned.
                        It seemed to <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> that only Jordan, which had
                        longest frontier with Israel, was victim of “balance of strength” policy.
                        Israel could get military equipment it wanted from various sources and
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, Syria and Iraq could get theirs
                        from Soviets. <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> must show it won't let its
                        friends down. Having already invested over one-half billion dollars in
                        Jordan, <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> must now judge how much Jordan
                        is worth to it.</p>
                    <p>11. Secretary expressed hope Jordan's security problems could be met without
                        interfering with <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> development program. At
                        this point he could only say we would have to see what can be done and would
                        be as responsive as possible. Secretary noted that, just as Israel found it
                        difficult guard against terrorism, Jordan undoubtedly realized that complete
                        security not easy to guarantee. <persName corresp="#p_KGA2">Khammash</persName> concurred, saying principal need was increased
                        mobility and firepower to improve defense. Secretary said we were looking
                        into possibility that techniques developed in Viet Nam might be applicable
                        in detecting intrusions <pb n="693" xml:id="pg_693" facs="0725"/>across

                    <p>12. <persName corresp="#p_KGA2">Khammash</persName> noted <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> had been subjected to repeated <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> inquiries regarding stationing tanks on
                        West Bank—a restriction not applicable to Israel. This had had unfortunate
                        effect and he hoped subject would not be brought up again. Secretary said he
                        appreciated problem and would give it further thought. In conclusion,
                        Secretary assured <persName corresp="#p_KGA2">Khammash</persName> we felt

                        he discussed it in the <gloss target="#t_IRG1">IRG</gloss>. As you remember,
                        the Egyptian economic delegation told you officially in September that the

                        end of November in order to get grain elsewhere if necessary. This is such
                        an important decision that we should not make it by default.</p>
                    <p>2. Budget Bureau now has the Presidential Determination necessary to continue
                        our <hi rend="italic">technical assistance program.</hi> The President
                        agreed in June to continue this when he approved offering <gloss target="#t_CCC1">CCC</gloss> credit sales for six months, but we can
                        hardly ask him to sign a new Determination without having some notion of
                        where we're going.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">One way</hi> to handle this would be <hi rend="italic">for

                        problem in our <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> relations is lack of
                        confidence. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> believes we're out
                        to get him, and the fact that our high level travellers bypass him just
                        confirms his belief. The Egyptians still consider that postponement (for
                        pressing US reasons) of the Secretary's scheduled visit last spring was a
                        calculated slight, but the invitation has been repeated.</p>
                    <p>A visit would have several <hi rend="italic">advantages.</hi> If we can't
                        make a food decision now, he could explain why. He could also make plausible
                        our line that, even though we have difficulties with further concessional
                        food aid, we're not trying to bring <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> down. At the least, it would give the Secretary a
                        chance for a heart-to-heart talk with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> which could be a sound basis for the President's
                        decision.</p>

                        rebellion; more recently, his army has become increasingly Draconian in the
                        Yemen; Radio Cairo continues to agitate Arab “nationalism”; his policy often
                        parallels Moscow's.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Now</hi> that that experiment has run out of steam, and
                            <hi rend="italic">we have to decide among three possible courses:</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>—We can give up, drop food aid and try to live with a potentially more
                        troublesome <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>.</p>
                    <pb n="696" xml:id="pg_696" facs="0728"/>
                    <p>—We can go on—if the President will approve—with an uncertain series of
                        interim food agreements.</p>
                    <p>—We can seek some new base for our relationship, though less ambitious than
                        our 1962 effort.</p>
                    <p>Our own inclination is to try the last, though we would settle for the second
                        this time. We can't see that the first buys us anything and it could cost us
                        a lot. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> could behave much worse
                        and do much greater damage to our interests. On balance, within the Arab
                        world he has been a restraining force vis-a-vis Israel. His present
                        involvement in Syria is a force for restraint, not aggression. He has not
                        precipitated attacks on Western oil interests or inhibited movement of
                        oil.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary's visit could be the first step in building something new. The
                        main disadvantage to his going now without going to Amman would be our
                        apparent support for <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> at a time
                        when <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s propaganda machine has
                        King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> on the ropes. It would
                        be ideal if the Secretary could go to Amman too though that may be
                        impossible.</p>
                    <p>We think this idea is worth considering. But <hi rend="italic">the main point
                            is to find out how the Secretary plans to handle these <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> decisions.</hi> If we're going to let
                        them drift till he comes back, we ought to be signalling the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> that we're just being indecisive—not saying
                        no.</p>

                        have to put together some kind of package and will try to gear it to
                        streamlining existing forces and improving border control. We don't agree
                        with <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> that this is chiefly a
                        military problem because we don't believe—as he does—that the Israeli attack
                        was the first step in grabbing West Jordan. We are holding Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> in reserve to sell our
                        final proposition to <persName corresp="#p_KGA2">Khammash</persName> when we
                        have a clearer idea what we can do.</p>
                    <p>The Israelis have recovered their composure enough to take us to task mildly
                        for supporting last week's <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Security
                        Council censure of Israel. They claim the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                        action gives a blank check to the Arab governments backing the terrorists.
                        We're pressing them to beef up their own border control effort and to help
                        improve the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> machinery there. They're
                        willing to talk about improving their own system, but we'll have to press
                        hard before they will be willing to see the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> beefed up. Nevertheless, we still feel the least that ought
                        to come out of this mess is a system that will be a serious deterrent to
                        continued terrorism.</p>

                    <p rend="center">PALESTINE ARAB TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS</p>
                    <p>1. The tradition of terrorism in Arab-Israeli relations extends back into the
                        1920's and '30's. Before the Arab-Israeli war of 1948–49, terrorism was the
                        principal weapon of both Arabs and Jews in harassing the British authorities
                        in Palestine. In the early 1950's, the Arab governments organized
                        paramilitary commando groups—fedayeen—which undertook raiding and sabotage
                        missions into Israel. Israel's invasion of Sinai was in large measure a
                        retaliation for this fedayeen activity, and the terrorist raiding ceased
                        after the 1956 Sinai campaign.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The <gloss target="#t_PLO1">PLO</gloss>
                    </p>
                    <p>2. As official support of terrorist operations ceased, many Palestinian Arabs
                        became increasingly frustrated at the relative lack of aggressiveness toward
                        Israel on the part of Arab governments. There was persistent agitation among
                        Palestinians throughout the Arab world for some kind of representative
                        organization, and this culminated in 1964 in the formation of the Palestine
                        Liberation Organization (<gloss target="#t_PLO1">PLO</gloss>). The <gloss target="#t_PLO1">PLO</gloss> received the formal sanction of the League
                        of Arab States at an Arab summit meeting that year.</p>
                    <p>3. The organization is a kind of Palestinian government in exile but it has
                        been careful to avoid such a designation because of King Husayn's
                        well-founded suspicion that it posed a threat to his authority in west
                        Jordan. The <gloss target="#t_PLO1">PLO</gloss>'s activities are mainly
                        political and military; it has tried, for example, to form a “Palestine
                        Liberation Army” around a core of Palestinian units which had been formed
                        over the years in the Egyptian, Syrian, and Iraqi armies. Nasir exercises
                        considerable influence over the <gloss target="#t_PLO1">PLO</gloss>, though
                        he does not completely control its leaders. The organization's “Voice of
                        Palestine” broadcasts emanate from Cairo. The PLO is led by a dynamic
                        super-orator, Ahmad Shuqayri, a Palestinian who at various times has been a
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> representative for Syria and Saudi
                        Arabia.</p>
                    <p>4. The <gloss target="#t_PLO1">PLO</gloss>'s long-range plans for opposing
                        the Israelis initially omitted sponsorship of terrorist operations into
                        Israel. <gloss target="#t_PLO1">PLO</gloss> leaders and sponsors recognized
                        that such operations would provoke Israeli retaliation, and very possibly
                        lead to a war for which the Arab governments <pb n="699" xml:id="pg_699" facs="0731"/>are still not ready. This policy was a source of
                        frustration to many activist Palestinians, and it led to the emergence of
                        the present generation of terrorist groups. The <gloss target="#t_PLO1">PLO</gloss> has failed to persuade these groups to submit to over-all
                            <gloss target="#t_PLO1">PLO</gloss> direction, and, to meet their
                        competition, has within the past few months felt compelled to undertake such
                        activities on its own. The “Organization of Heroes of the Return” (to
                        Palestine) is the group which appears to be the new <gloss target="#t_PLO1">PLO</gloss> terrorist arm. Some of its members clashed with Israeli
                        forces near the Lebanese border in mid-October.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Fatah</p>
                    <p>5. The most prominent of the terrorist groups is Fatah (a reverse acronym of
                        the Arabic for “Palestine Liberation Movement”). Fatah is sometimes also
                        known by the name of its commando arm, Asifa (Storm). Fatah appears to be
                        descended from a clandestine Palestinian organization—now inactive—which was
                        formed in the mid-1950's. Some of its members had connections with the
                        Muslim Brotherhood, a conservative, strongly anti-Nasir politico-religious
                        movement. Fatah also may have had links with the Arab Higher Committee of
                        Hajj Amin al-Husayni, the ex-Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, with whom the
                        Brotherhood collaborated in regard to Palestine affairs.</p>
                    <p>6. In its present incarnation, Fatah emerged publicly in January 1965, when
                        it claimed responsibility for terrorist incidents in Israel. Its leaders had
                        previously participated in the organization of the <gloss target="#t_PLO1">PLO</gloss>, but had become disenchanted. They are also disgusted with
                        the continuing inability of most Arab governments to act decisively toward
                        Israel, and are wary of any official control which might curtail Fatah's
                        operations.</p>
                    <p>7. Syria, the most bellicose of the Arab states, is the one government whose
                        policy comes closest to Fatah's violently anti-Israeli line. Damascus
                        supports Fatah by providing it with a base for its operations, training
                        facilities, and a propaganda outlet. The infiltrations into Israel, however,
                        have been undertaken from Jordanian and Lebanese territory, since those
                        borders are more easily traversed. This has occurred without the approval of
                        either the Jordanian or the Lebanese government. Most of Fatah's financial
                        support comes from wealthy Palestinians living in Kuwait and Saudi
                        Arabia.</p>
                    <p>8. The number of people who participate in Fatah, as well as in other
                        terrorist organizations, is unknown and probably fluctuates. Many of the
                        terrorists are professional thugs or smugglers, and some were active against
                        Israel in 1955–56. The Israelis say Fatah has been responsible for 61
                        sabotage incidents. Israeli Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> recently stated, however, that Fatah had been inactive
                        for about six weeks.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>9. A rival Palestinian terrorist organization called the “Palestinian
                        Liberation Front” (<gloss target="#t_PLF1">PLF</gloss>) has been credited by
                        the Israelis with the 12 November road mining incident which triggered the
                        Israeli raid into Jordan the next day. Jordanian officials also suspected
                        the <gloss target="#t_PLF1">PLF</gloss> of having perpetrated that incident,
                        and they had begun a search for those responsible at the time Israel
                        attacked. Little is known about the <gloss target="#t_PLF1">PLF</gloss>.
                        Like Fatah, it apparently aims at provoking a general Arab-Israeli war, but
                        it is reputed to be more skilled in its operations. <gloss target="#t_PLF1">PLF</gloss> members are said to regard Fatah as an organization of
                        publicity seekers.</p>
                    <p>10. Some “terrorism” in Israel is more or less spontaneous. For years, Arab
                        smugglers and crossborder operators have occasionally clashed with Israeli
                        security forces. Incidents of this sort have been much reduced as the
                        Israelis' security measures have been tightened. The organized, professional
                        terrorism of the Fatah, the <gloss target="#t_PLF1">PLF</gloss>, and of the
                            <gloss target="#t_PLO1">PLO</gloss>'s new arm, poses problems for
                        Israeli authorities that have no easy solution.</p>

                        Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense (<gloss target="#t_ISA1">ISA</gloss>),
                        I–28025/66, dated 28 November 1966,<note n="2" xml:id="d357fn2">Not
                            found.</note> subject as above, which requests the views of the Joint
                        Chiefs of Staff on further military actions which the United States should
                        take to assist the Government of Jordan.</p>
                    <p>2. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) The internal crisis in Jordan which has
                        arisen in the wake of the 13 November 1966 Israeli attack requires
                        additional prompt responses on the part of the US Government to restore
                        stability and <pb n="701" xml:id="pg_701" facs="0733"/>bolster King
                            <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>. The stability of the
                        regime and the maintenance of order are dependent upon the loyalty and
                        effectiveness of the Armed Forces. In order to insure their continued
                        support, any assistance to Jordan must be of such impact that it will
                        demonstrate to the Armed Forces, the civilian population and the Middle East
                        as a whole, that King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> has the
                        active support of the US Government.</p>
                    <p>3. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) The most immediate and probably the
                        strongest impact action that the United States could take would be to
                        suspend arms shipments to Israel. In this connection, the Joint Chiefs of
                        Staff note the statement made by Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> to the Israeli Ambassador on 21
                        November 1966<note n="3" xml:id="d357fn3">See <ref target="#d343">Document
                                343</ref>.</note> that a recurrence of action across armistice lines
                        could bring reexamination of decision to sell certain military equipment to
                        Israel. The Joint Chiefs of Staff consider that should another incident
                        occur under similar circumstances, the United States should suspend the sale
                        and deliveries of military equipment to Israel.</p>
                    <p>4. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> has stated that a requirement exists to improve
                        internal security and Jordanian defensive capabilities by increasing the pay
                        of enlisted personnel, increasing the size of the Armed Forces, and the
                        addition of new equipment. In developing their views on these matters, the
                        Joint Chiefs of Staff have considered the Military Assistance Program to
                        Jordan, the recommendations of the Country Team, and the urgent Jordanian
                        requirements as presented to the Office of the Secretary of Defense by
                            <persName corresp="#p_KGA2">General Khammash</persName>.</p>
                    <p>5. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) The complete list of equipment submitted
                        by <persName corresp="#p_KGA2">General Khammash</persName> is beyond
                        Jordan's ability to operate and maintain effectively and would entail a
                        heavy financial burden. Although it is impractical for the United States to
                        furnish all of the equipment requested, a more modest equipment package
                        should be provided which would assist in deterring future Israeli border
                        raids, improve Jordan's border defenses, and have a less adverse impact on
                        the Jordanian economy.</p>
                    <p>6. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) Attached at Appendix A<note n="4" xml:id="d357fn4">The appendices are not printed.</note> is a proposed
                        package, which, with a pay increase, would meet, in part, the most pressing
                        security needs of Jordan as expressed by <persName corresp="#p_KGA2">General
                            Khammash</persName> and provide an important psychological impact. As
                        proposed by the referenced memorandum, this package has been developed
                        without regard to planned financial ceilings on military and supporting
                        assistance for Jordan. Cost of the equipment package is approximately $12.8
                        million. It would entail an increase of approximately 11,400 personnel, of
                        which 4,500 would be part-time border village guards. Addition of these
                        personnel and approval of a 25 percent pay raise would require an estimated
                        $11.1 <pb n="702" xml:id="pg_702" facs="0734"/>million increase in annual
                        Jordanian defense expenditures. Armaments and equipment proposed in the
                        package would produce no significant change in the arms balance in the
                        Middle East. Additional military measures which could be taken to assist the
                        Government of Jordan are also contained in Appendix A. A recapitulation of
                        the arms and equipment package is contained in Appendix B. The equipment
                        list submitted by <persName corresp="#p_KGA2">General Khammash</persName>,
                        annotated, where possible, with price and availability, is contained in
                        Appendix C.</p>
                    <p>7. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) The Joint Chiefs of Staff note that the
                        provisions of the package require diversions of equipment from Turkey, Saudi
                        Arabia, Iran, Korea and other countries and consider that the United States
                        should not unilaterally make these diversions, but rather the agreement of
                        these countries should be sought.</p>
                    <p>8. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) In reference to the memorandum by the
                        Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (ISA), I–28187/66, dated 3 December

                        on the option for Jordan to purchase additional F–104 aircraft and the

                        that:</p>
                    <p>a. The United States support in principle the Armed Forces pay increase

                        However, before assuming this recurring annual cost, every effort should be
                        made to obtain the necessary money from other Arab states such as Kuwait and
                        Saudi Arabia.</p>
                    <p>b. The United States provide to the Government of Jordan the arms and
                        equipment package proposed in Appendix A and support the attendant increase
                        in personnel.</p>

                    <p>1. In conversation sixth with Israeli Minister <persName corresp="#p_EE1">Evron</persName>
                        <gloss target="#t_Dept1">Dept</gloss> officer raised difficulties recently
                        encountered by <gloss target="#t_DATT1">DATT</gloss> in obtaining permission
                        visit Israeli military installations and disapproval attache reconnaissance
                        efforts voiced by some <gloss target="#t_IDF1">IDF</gloss> officers. Using
                        line taken by Ambassador in second <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss>
                        with Foreign Minister, <gloss target="#t_Dept1">Dept</gloss> officer said
                        attaches under standing instructions travel around Israel, particularly
                        during times of crisis, and also to become acquainted with Israeli military
                        installations. Their mission no secret, and Ambassador had reminded Foreign
                        Minister on Nov 28 that Prime Minister himself had said attache travel
                        around country welcomed provided there no roadblocks. Unless we had
                        independent access to all parts of country we would not be in position
                        provide assurances to certain other countries about Israeli intentions.
                        Moreover, limitations on attaches would tend to create suspicions in our own
                        minds about Israeli intentions. We therefore hoped any misunderstandings on
                        part of <gloss target="#t_IDF1">IDF</gloss> could be dispelled and there
                        would be no question of free movement by our attaches.</p>
                    <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_EE1">Evron</persName> in somewhat defensive response
                        ended up saying he was certain no restrictions would be placed on attaches.
                        He also used Foreign Minister's line that <gloss target="#t_DATT1">DATT</gloss> had asked to “inspect” installations in order to check out
                        Israeli assurances regarding Jordan. <gloss target="#t_Dept1">Dept</gloss>
                        officer rejoined he certain request was to visit not to inspect and there
                        must have been misunderstanding. In course conversation <gloss target="#t_Dept1">Dept</gloss> officer also reminded <persName corresp="#p_EE1">Evron</persName> of easy access Israeli attaches have
                        to US officials and agencies.</p>

                    <p> CAP 661223. Information. Forewarned is forearmed and you should be aware
                        that the Israelis are now zeroing in on our proposed small military aid
                        package for Jordan. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName>
                        was in to see me this afternoon<note n="2" xml:id="d359fn2">A memorandum of
                            the December 8 conversation is ibid.</note> and conveyed the clear
                        message that the Israeli Government is very much concerned that anything we
                        do for Jordan will unsettle the delicate military balance in the area. We
                        will be sending you more formally in the next day or two a specific proposal
                        on Jordan. Defense still has not quite wrapped up all the details, but it is
                        fair to say that the package will be minimal and will not seriously affect
                        the Israeli-Jordanian military balance. However, we will have to reckon with
                        an Israeli reaction no matter what we do. We are on firm logical ground in
                        saying that we would be doing nothing more for Jordan than already planned
                        if the Israelis had not raided on 13 November. After all, we are only
                        picking up the pieces in a mess they created. But regardless of how firmly
                        we take that line, the Israelis have regained their composure and are going
                        to be pretty tough to deal with.</p>
                    <p>We will include recommendations for handling the Israeli side of the problem
                        when we send our final proposal to you. However, I wanted you to be
                        forewarned of this aspect of the problem in case someone should try to reach
                        you at the Ranch.</p>

                    <p>As instructed, I called Abe Feinberg pronto. I told him I wanted to clue him
                        privately so he could head off a developing problem which, otherwise could
                        cause nothing but trouble all around.</p>
                    <p>The situation in Jordan was still very dicey. We were working day and night
                        to overcome a crisis which Israel itself had created. As usual, we had to
                        pick up the pieces. It was imperative—in our own interest, in Jordan's, and
                        above all in Israel's—that we strengthen <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>'s position and his support from his army. This would
                        almost inevitably require expediting some arms already contracted for, and
                        quite possibly some added sweeteners.</p>
                    <p>But when we told Israel's Embassy this, we had gotten a lot of backflap about
                        why we hadn't consulted Israel first before talking with Jordan, about bad
                        faith if we sold new arms to Jordan, etc. I wasn't up on these matters any
                        more, but wanted him to know that such rejoinders had caused much high level
                        annoyance here.</p>
                    <p>So I urged that Abe tell his friends to keep their shirts on, and not start
                        telling us how to handle Jordan again. Their credentials were hardly very
                        good on this subject; the very time when we were being forced again to clean
                        up their mess was no time to start hitting us from the flank and souring
                        relations. Abe should pass this word in spades, as coming from a friend.</p>
                    <p>Abe said he'd see <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> (now in New
                        York) pronto. But he wondered whether more arms to Jordan would create a new
                        arms imbalance; in this case he urged a formula to help Israel out too. I
                        retorted that asking us to compensate Israel would leave a very bad taste
                        just now. In any case I doubted that any significant military imbalance was
                        likely; we weren't foolish. The problem was rather one of preventing the
                        truly major imbalance which would result if Jordan went sour.</p>
                    <p>Abe wanted me to know the “domestic political angle.” The entire US Jewish
                        community felt it was isolated after Israel's censure by the US. To add
                        another pinprick by announcing arms to Jordan alone wouldn't sit well. I
                        said I'd pass on this message, but urged he pass on the full flavor of mine.
                        This was just the wrong time to “rock the boat”; <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> would be wise to pour oil on troubled waters.</p>

                    <p>So Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> has designed a

                        existing appropriations) on top of $3.5 million already in Jordan's <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1967 military aid program. Instead of
                        enlarging his forces, it would help him improve pay, mobility and

                        army.</p>
                    <p>This offer probably won't satisfy <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>. We see it as the starting point for a tough series
                        of negotiations over our whole aid program. We may have to give a little,
                        but before we do we'd send former Ambassador Bill Macomber to try to talk

                    <p>1456. 1. I was called to see the King late yesterday evening at Homar, the
                        King's private residence outside Amman. <gloss target="#t_Emboff1">EmbOff</gloss> accompanied me.</p>
                    <p>2. The meeting with the King lasted one hour. I have never seen him so grim
                        or so obviously under pressure. It was apparent that he had to use the
                        utmost in self-restraint to keep his emotions from erupting openly. At
                        several points in the conversation he had tears in his eyes. Then he said
                        that although the surface manifestations of discontent in the form of
                        demonstrations had abated, pressures under the surface were in fact building
                        up. The discontent on the West Bank is deeper than he had imagined. “The
                        growing split between East Bank and West Bank has ruined my dreams.” The
                        only thing that binds the army to him, he said, is traditional loyalty, but
                        this tie is daily growing weaker. “There is near despair in the army and the
                        army no longer has confidence in me. A contributing factor is that the army
                        is over-extended throughout the country for reasons of internal security,
                        and this is <pb n="708" xml:id="pg_708" facs="0740"/>causing the army and
                        the people to become increasingly fed up, an obvious objective of those
                        opposed to this regime.” The King observed that he is beset on all sides by
                        enemies, outside Jordan and within Jordan, with Syria openly calling for his
                        overthrow, publicly offering arms for the purpose, and covertly infiltrating
                        arms and terrorists into Jordan to help achieve the purpose.</p>
                    <p>4. The King said he simply must have Washington's decision on his request for
                        assistance. Nor could he longer forego the presence and help of <persName corresp="#p_KGA2">General Khammash</persName> in Amman at this critical
                        time. <persName corresp="#p_KGA2">General Khammash</persName> had been in
                        Washington for nearly two weeks, and as yet he has been given no answer.

                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> has been twice
                        postponed, and the appointment is now set for Wednesday. The King is aware
                        that the Israeli <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> is visiting
                        Washington early next week, before Wednesday.<note n="2" xml:id="d362fn2">

                        and he can no longer delay making decisions on the courses of action he must
                        take. In the circumstances a temporizing answer to <persName corresp="#p_KGA2">Khammash</persName> would have to be considered as a
                        negative answer.</p>
                    <p>5. If <persName corresp="#p_KGA2">General Khammash</persName> receives an
                        answer “which is not responsive,” the King would not go to Washington, as,
                        until recently, he had contemplated doing should <persName corresp="#p_KGA2">Khammash</persName> fail to get a satisfactory answer. The King said he
                        greatly admires President Johnson and it would give him great personal
                        satisfaction to meet with the President personally. But the pressures
                        building up on him are so great, he said, that there is no longer time for a
                        trip to Washington. Nor, if <persName corresp="#p_KGA2">Khammash</persName>
                        is unsuccessful, would a trip by him, he reflected, with its attendant
                        publicity, serve the interests of either of us. For a decade, the King said,
                        we and he have been partners. And in this critical hour we are the only
                        friend to whom he can turn. If we cannot help him, he said, then he must
                        move quickly to an alternate course. “The right answer from the US would
                        enable me to justify my past policy to my army, to my people, to the <gloss target="#t_PLO1">PLO</gloss>, and to everyone else. If I do not get the
                        right answer, even I must conclude my past policy has been a failure.”</p>
                    <p>6. Since he was unsuccessful in obtaining postponement of the Arab Defense
                        Council meeting in Cairo, the King said, and since <persName corresp="#p_KGA2">Khammash</persName> has not gotten an answer from us,
                        the King had felt he had no choice but to make a concession to the pressures
                        he was subjected to at the Cairo meeting. Friday he had had to instruct his
                        delegation in <pb n="709" xml:id="pg_709" facs="0741"/>Cairo to agree to the
                        stationing of Saudi and Iraqi troops in Jordan. The King said that three
                        brigades of these foreign Arab troops would be involved. In return for this
                        concession the Arab Defense Council had agreed to meet Jordan's demands,
                        which include, inter alia, the strengthening of Egyptian forces in the
                        Israeli border area (presumably Sinai). The stationing of Iraqi and Saudi
                        troops in Jordan would not come about for a least two months, said <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>, since a great deal had to be
                        worked out first. I asked the King whether in the event the US were
                        responsive to his request for assistance he would nonetheless have to go
                        through with the stationing of Iraqi and Saudi troops in Jordan. The King
                        replied that he supposed he might somehow be able to head it off during the
                        course of the technical negotiations to come in this regard. He said he is
                        not happy with the instructions he had to send to his delegation in
                        Cairo.</p>
                    <p>7. The King said that if the US cannot be responsive to his request for
                        assistance, he saw three courses open to him.</p>
                    <p>8. The first course was to turn to the East. “I will not try to mislead you,
                        nor to blackmail you, by telling you I will turn to the East. I cannot and
                        will not do so. My reign has been devoted towards building Jordan to be a
                        self-sufficient, moderate, evolutionary state. I have all my life fought the
                        East. If in the end Jordan feels she must turn to the East, it would have to
                        be under someone else, not with me.”</p>
                    <p>9. The second alternative, said the King, was to “batten down the hatches and
                        take on everyone who is working against me at one and the same time.” This
                        was a course which tempted him, said the King, because he was ready for a
                        fight and he did not care about his own fate. But, he said, “The deck is
                        stacked against me and I do not have the right to commit those who have been
                        loyal to me to a course which would likely mean their doom.”</p>
                    <p>10. The third alternative, said the King, is the one which commends itself to
                        him as the best. He would declare the West Bank a “military directorate” and
                        call on all Arab states, and the <gloss target="#t_PLO1">PLO</gloss>, to
                        furnish forces to be stationed on the West Bank for the protection of that
                        area. Jordan would leave on the West Bank its pro rata contribution of
                        forces, and withdraw the remainder of its forces, now stationed on the West
                        Bank, to the East Bank. The King would not, he said, make this as an offer,
                        to be accepted or rejected by the Palestinians and by the other Arab states.
                        He would simply announce this is what he has decided to do, and if other
                        Arab states do not furnish the necessary defense forces, that would just be
                        too bad. At least this arrangement would permit him to make a redoubt of the
                        East Bank, he said, and “this might offer me one last chance to serve my
                        cause.” The King observed that Prime Minister Tell thought of the “military
                        directorate” idea as a means of calling the bluff of Palestinians and of
                        other Arab states. <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">
                            <pb n="710" xml:id="pg_710" facs="0742"/>Hussein</persName> indicated he
                        diagnoses the situation in Jordan as more critical than does Tell. He
                        indicated further that he is serious about establishing a “military
                        directorate,” and not as a means to call a bluff. The King said he was quite
                        aware that if the West Bank were transformed into a “military directorate”,
                        much as he envisages, Israel might decide to take military action. He said
                        this was a chance he and all the Arabs would simply have to take. To try to
                        maintain the status quo in the face of an unfavorable response from
                        Washington to his request for assistance was clearly impossible.</p>
                    <p>11. <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> There were many indications during the
                        course of the conversation that the King has become suspicious of US
                        motivations and intentions with respect to Jordan. He is perturbed that we
                        were not able to give <persName corresp="#p_KGA2">General
                            Khammash</persName> an answer during the first week the General was in
                        Washington. I gather his apprehensions are twofold: (A) that, as he sees it,
                        we are so closely tied to Israel, and the Israelis can generate such
                        pressure on us, that this is a powerful inhibiting factor in our ability to
                        respond to the King's request for assistance; (B) that the King believes the
                        US does not have full appreciation of the seriousness of the situation
                        concerning Jordan or of what the King considers the potent desires of others
                        to replace our influence in Jordan, or even to liquidate Jordan.</p>
                    <p>12. I think we can take at face value the King's statement that we must give
                            <persName corresp="#p_KGA2">General Khammash</persName> an answer by
                        Wednesday and that the answer we give will be considered by the King to be
                        the final answer.</p>
                    <p>13. I regret I cannot say with any degree of certainty what the King and
                            <persName corresp="#p_KGA2">General Khammash</persName> would consider
                        to be a “satisfactory response.” Since <persName corresp="#p_KGA2">General
                            Khammash</persName> is in Washington, and he is the key man in this
                        regard and the King will likely abide by <persName corresp="#p_KGA2">Khammash</persName>'s judgment, the Department is in a better position
                        than Embassy Amman to probe the answer. I am fairly certain, however, that
                        the package outlined in paragraph 6 of our tel 1415<note n="3" xml:id="d362fn3">Telegram 1415 from Amman, December 6, reported
                            disaffection in the Jordanian Army and urged a positive response to the
                                <persName corresp="#p_KGA2">Khammash</persName> mission. Paragraph 6
                            recommended providing the army with a $20 million package of defensive
                            equipment, increasing annual budgetary support by $16 million to finance
                            a defensive buildup, delivering previously negotiated ground and air
                            packages, leaving the door open to future negotiations on items on which
                            they could not reach agreement, and preparing for an increased
                            deployment of equipment on the West Bank. (National Archives and Records
                            Administration, <gloss target="#t_RG1">RG</gloss> 59, Central Files
                            1964–66, POL 23 JORDAN)</note> represents minimum, and I cannot exclude
                        the possibility that even that package is undershooting what <persName corresp="#p_KGA2">Khammash</persName> and the King consider to be the
                        minimum.</p>
                    <p>14. The concept of a Palestine entity is not a new idea with the King; he was
                        turning over something of this sort in his mind last <pb n="711" xml:id="pg_711" facs="0743"/>summer in political rather than military
                        terms as a means of coping with his West Bank problem.</p>
                    <p>15. The King said he hoped the views he had expressed at the meeting last
                        evening could be brought to the personal attention of the President.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>At this morning's breakfast with the Vice President, Bob McNamara, Nick
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>, Bill Handley, Bill
                        Macomber, <persName corresp="#p_WWH1">Howard Wriggins</persName>, and
                            <persName corresp="#p_DRP1">Rodger Davies</persName>, the King's problem
                        was thoroughly discussed. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> and
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> could not attend; but
                        both have been brought in. Nick talked with <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> and, while not familiar with the details, <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> agrees this is broadly the right
                        course. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName>, who was committed to
                        breakfast with <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName>, is now going over
                        the package.<note n="2" xml:id="d363fn2">
                            <persName>Rostow</persName>'s handwritten note in the margin reads as
                            follows: “He has gone to New York to clear with <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>. We'll hear later in the
                            afternoon. W.”</note> The conclusions were as follows.</p>
                    <p>1. The proposed package was insufficient to meet the King's essential
                        political needs.</p>
                    <p>2. Movement on a larger package would be appropriate only as we pressed
                        discussions with Israel on improving border surveillance technology. These
                        will be started by Nick with <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName>
                        today and would go forward at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and in
                        the Middle East with Israel, and, hopefully, with the Arab countries as
                        well.</p>
                    <p>3. Bob McNamara, Nick, and the others agreed that the package for <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> should be expanded in the following
                        ways: (a) delivery <pb n="712" xml:id="pg_712" facs="0744"/>of the 12
                        F–104's presently in the Jordanian pipeline should be accelerated. Six
                        should be drawn from the inventory within 30 days and delivered to <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> even though the pilots and ground
                        environment are not yet ready; (b) 18 self-propeller antiaircraft units
                        should be airlifted within 30 to 60 days; (c) the $4.7 million package to
                        improve mobility, firepower, and effectiveness—which you have already
                        seen—should also be airlifted.</p>
                    <p>4. When he talks to <persName corresp="#p_KGA2">General Khammash</persName>,
                        Bob McNamara would make clear that, while this is less than the King asked
                        for, it is a substantial and prompt response and that we have several
                        parallel concerns: (a) the King should stress quality, rather than quantity,
                        and we could only make this package available if he agrees to keep his
                        manpower at present levels; (b) we assume he would continue his policy of
                        moderation and restraint and his considerable efforts to prevent guerrillas
                        from using Jordan as a base for operations against Israel and we will
                        consider helping him to improve his border police (AID is reviewing this
                        part of his problem); (c) no United Arab Command troops should be situated
                        on the West bank area of Jordan.</p>
                    <p>5. Several present hoped that you could personally take ten minutes with
                            <persName corresp="#p_KGA2">Khammash</persName> before he sees Bob
                        McNamara tomorrow at 11 o'clock to discuss: (a) our concern for <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>'s future; (b) our substantial and
                        prompt response; and (c) our need to discuss the longer run financial
                        implications of this assistance. However, Nick does not want to trouble you,
                        knowing that, if you see <persName corresp="#p_KGA2">Khammash</persName>
                        even for five minutes, you will feel it necessary to see <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName>. I believe you should keep out at this
                        stage.</p>
                    <p>6. We will get flack from the Israelis no matter what we do, although
                            <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> acknowledged to <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> the raid was a grave error. It was
                        the consensus of all present, including the Vice President, that this sort
                        of package is what is required and we'll have to use our discussions with

                        Nevertheless, I see little alternative to helping <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> in this way. And we will press hard
                        on Israel the importance of border stabilization through the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> if possible and directly, if that is the only

                            utmost to eliminate terrorism against Israel from Jordan, and had warned
                            them that he could not absorb or tolerate a serious retaliatory raid.
                            Expressing great bitterness, he declared that the attack was a complete
                            betrayal of his efforts in the interest of peace and stability. A copy

                        assistance to Jordan. I have discussed these with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> and he is in agreement.<note n="2" xml:id="d365fn2">Telegram 101492 to <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss>, December 13, from <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>, transmitted the text of <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>'s memorandum, noting that it

                    </p>
                    <p>1. We should proceed with the recommendations in the attached memorandum
                        which expedite current programmed <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>
                        assistance and include an increment, primarily of defensive weapons,

                    </p>
                    <p>2. We should candidly inform the Israeli Government about this program. Based
                        on my conversation with Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Abba
                            Eban</persName>, I believe that the Israeli Government will accept this
                        program as necessary to support the regime of King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> quite candidly said that the Israelis had as much of a
                        stake in preserving the King as we did.</p>
                    <p>3. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> believes that
                        we are likely to have a sizable domestic problem with respect to the
                        increment even if the Israeli Government quietly agrees to it. He believes,
                        and I agree, that in presenting this to the Israelis (and to the Jewish
                        community in this country) it would be helpful to give something to the
                        Israeli side of the ledger: We recommend</p>
                    <p>a. We tell the Israelis that we will make every effort to speed up deliveries
                        of Skyhawks (A4's). Bob McNamara has no objection to this commitment and
                        believes delivery probably can be speeded up somewhat to enable some
                        delivery in advance of the scheduled date.</p>
                    <p>b. We tell the Israeli Government that we will attempt to assist them in
                        working out static defense plans and, to the extent possible, help with
                        hardware to make this effective. We should further state to them that while
                        we cannot presently commit ourselves to any dollar-for-dollar offsetting
                        through AID or otherwise of our increased commitments to Jordan, we will
                        take this into account in giving sympathetic consideration to Israeli
                        requests for assistance; for example, we might <pb n="715" xml:id="pg_715" facs="0747"/>be able to subsidize some of their African operations which
                        indirectly benefit us. (There is a good deal of opposition to any firm
                        commitment in this respect and many Government officials believe that we
                        should not really offer anything in this regard to Israel at this time.
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> and I believe,
                        however, that to meet the sensibilities of the Israelis (and their domestic
                        supporters) that we should make this general commitment as an appropriate
                        response. The amount is not large and such a commitment would help the
                        Israelis and help us domestically. We believe this can be worked out to the
                        satisfaction of all, particularly since it is not necessary to do this
                        simultaneously with the Jordanian move and can be worked out at a later
                        date.)</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> would be happy to
                        take this up with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName>,
                        who could help us greatly here with the Jewish community.<note n="4" xml:id="d365fn4">There is no indication of the President's approval or

                        <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> opened by noting substantive
                        change in Israel's security situation over past two or three years. Israel's
                        deterrent capacity had achieved a viable balance in that no neighboring
                        state wished military confrontation. Israel's enemies were now employing new
                        method of expressing active hostility: guerrilla warfare, classic strategy
                        of the weaker side. Arab press reflected tremendous interest in guerilla
                        warfare as practiced in Algeria, Viet-Nam, etc. Arabs now viewing this as
                        answer to direct confrontation. This technique plus the ideology of adding
                        the “sixth entity,” the Palestine nation, to the five opposing <pb n="716" xml:id="pg_716" facs="0748"/>Arab states created a major problem. This
                        entity serves as the “liberating force.” Its activities create a serious
                        situation and the prospect looks ominous. Perhaps no more than twenty people
                        were involved in disrupting train service between the capital city and the
                        coast, sabotage in the capital city, and causing safe travel on certain
                        frontier roads to be problematic. The action on November 13 was designed to
                        meet these problems. US and Israeli views diverge on wisdom of this decision
                        and US conclusion is that this answer is not valid. Israel is not committed
                        to this course as the answer but seeks to gain understanding seriousness of
                        the problem and of fact that Israel is looking for an answer. The government
                        had decided to look at static defense measure including reinforcing frontier
                        guards, increasing patrolling, adopting and investigating all kinds of
                        electronic and other electrical devices, increasing the number of vehicles
                        available for patrols, fencing and illuminating certain frontier
                        settlements, and asphalting certain border patrol routes to prevent mining.
                        These measures were burdensome economically and any US experience in these
                        fields would be useful.<note n="2" xml:id="d366fn2">Telegram 96200 to Tel

                        mobility. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> replied that <gloss target="#t_UNTSO1">UNTSO</gloss> would be more effective if the
                        organization were less interested in investigating incidents and more in
                        preventing them. Since the SYG has raised the question of strengthening
                            <gloss target="#t_UNTSO1">UNTSO</gloss>, he felt Israel would join the
                        dialogue. He noted that Israel did cooperate with <gloss target="#t_UNMOS1">UNMOS</gloss>, while Syrians locked them in their observation posts and
                        do not permit them to move more than fifty yards therefrom without
                        escort.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> expressed concern at the
                        exaggerated interpretation on the other side of the meaning of the events of
                        November 13. Israel believes that maintenance of the territorial status quo
                        and existing regime in Jordan is of great importance for Israel's security.
                            <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> however fells Israel
                        aspires to topple his regime and grab the West Bank. The King was way off
                        the track on this.</p>
                    <p>The Acting Secretary said he was prepared to accept these assurances but no
                        matter what Israel's motivation, its actions made things extremely difficult
                        and precarious for <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>. Israel
                        can't now say it <pb n="717" xml:id="pg_717" facs="0749"/>didn't mean to
                        precipitate the situation. It exists, and Israel must live with the
                        consequences. The tragic aspect is that Israel damaged the King's position
                        at a time when all the trends in Jordan were favorable. However what was
                        done is past and we must look to the future and a future with King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> in place is desirable for both
                        Israeli and US interests. Picking up the pieces will take patience and some
                        actions which we will undertake Israel will not like.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> touched on the adverse impact
                        on Israel's psychological atmosphere of the “insensitive and intemperate”
                        Security Council resolution censuring Israel. He appealed for understanding
                        and asked that in arriving at our decisions we weigh this factor. Twice in
                        the recent past Israel had been asked to give assent or not to object to
                        things we had found it necessary to do for Jordan. Israel had expended its
                        efforts to be helpful.</p>
                    <p>The Acting Secretary remarked that Jordan had also made efforts that might
                        have been more effective than Israel had been willing to give credit for.
                        This is part and parcel of King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>'s feeling that Israel's motivation must have ends
                        other than mere retaliation. Nevertheless despite the divergence in our
                        views on this action there are many areas of agreement between Israel and
                        the US and nothing is being undone. Our objective is to seek to stabilize
                        the border and help Jordan prevent incidents fomented by others. To do this,
                        we must have someone to work with; therefore, we seek to shore up King
                            <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>'s regime and to restore
                        the status quo ante or even improve on this. The magnitude of King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>'s request for assistance is such
                        that we are not able to meet it in entirety. What we have under
                        consideration will not alter the military situation or threaten Israel in
                        any way. We plan to do the minimum necessary to bolster the King's position
                        with his armed forces.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> said that in shoring up the
                        regime Israel and the US shared an interest. However, Israel hoped that what
                        we did would not adversely affect Israel's economic, political or military
                        position. Of particular concern was the type of hardware that might appear
                        on Israel's frontier. It had been a tradition with the two governments to
                        discuss problems such as these and to reach a consensus. This had created an
                        atmosphere of confidence. If Israel's reaction to what the US planned to do
                        is a factor in the situation, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName>
                        hoped the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> could be taken into our
                        confidence as we reached decisions.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> touched on the situation in
                        Egypt noting an apparent contradiction in its policies. On the one hand
                        Egypt seemed to be exercising prudence in not seeking a confrontation with
                        Israel and, he believed, <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> was
                        exercising restraining influence on Syria. At the same time, however,
                        propaganda from Cairo within the past two days had taken on a new stridency
                        in attacking King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> suggested that if there is a
                        dialogue between the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_UARG1">UARG</gloss>, <pb n="718" xml:id="pg_718" facs="0750"/>the US seek to moderate Cairo's output. Radio Cairo and the Voice of the
                        Arabs he thought were of extreme psychological importance in the present
                        situation.</p>

                            a.m., December 13, 1966; Deputy Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HTW1">Hoopes</persName> was also present</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> opened by
                        expressing the US Government's admiration for the coolness and courage with
                        which King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> and the Government
                        of Jordan were meeting the present crisis. He reiterated the US view that
                        the Israeli raid of November 13 had been a serious and unfortunate
                        miscalculation; he acknowledged that great psychological damage had been
                        done, and that the pressing problem now was to repair that damage. He said
                        however that we have reason to believe that the raid presaged no basic
                        change in Israeli policy.</p>
                    <p>He said he would hand <persName corresp="#p_KGA2">General Khammash</persName>
                        a paper which represented his own recommendations, that he had discussed
                        this paper with his colleagues in the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>,
                        and that he believed they were in agreement with him. While the paper did
                        not represent at this point a definite US decision and was therefore labeled
                        “draft,” he expected that it would be formally approved, and he wished
                            <persName corresp="#p_KGA2">General Khammash</persName> to take a copy
                        with him. He said that the President was prepared to send Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_MWBJ1">Macomber</persName> to Jordan immediately to
                        discuss the entire range of problems, including those dealt with in the
                        paper. (It was subsequently agreed that, since <persName corresp="#p_KGA2">General Khammash</persName> was pausing for 24 hours in London, it
                        would be more appropriate for Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MWBJ1">Macomber</persName> to depart Washington on 14 December than 13
                        December.)</p>
                    <p>The Secretary then read aloud, paragraph-by-paragraph, the paper entitled
                        “Measures For Strengthening Jordan's Defenses” which is attached as Tab A
                        hereto.</p>
                    <pb n="719" xml:id="pg_719" facs="0751"/>
                    <p>At the conclusion of the reading, <persName corresp="#p_KGA2">General
                            Khammash</persName> appeared grave, quiet and crestfallen. He responded
                        in a low voice. He said that he was aware of the large financial and
                        manpower implications in the lists he had presented on his arrival here, but
                        that the lists did not exaggerate Jordan's true requirements. He said
                        terrorism is rising; Jordan is beleaguered; Israel is not the only foe;
                        Jordan must also face the <gloss target="#t_PLO1">PLO</gloss>, Syria, and
                        the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. Iraq is another potential enemy,
                        although quiescent for the moment. Unfortunately, whatever the Israeli
                        intentions may be, their assurances can no longer be trusted. The Jordan
                        Army was humiliated by the raid of November 13 and this has caused the
                        people of Jordan to view the Army with suspicion; it has also caused the
                        Army to question King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>'s
                        leadership and his policy of moderation toward Israel.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KGA2">General Khammash</persName> said that Jordan was
                        projecting no military buildup, but was merely seeking to remedy
                        “deficiencies” in supporting arms, especially artillery and air defense. He
                        emphasized that the Jordan Army is presently handicapped by obsolescent
                        equipment, and that it needs a great deal more mobility than was indicated
                        in the US response (60 <gloss target="#t_APC1">APC</gloss> and a number of
                        trucks). He said he must be very frank regarding the US response. He
                        appreciated the assistance it represented, but it would not meet the
                        criteria of “adequate defense” as set by the Jordan Officer Corps;
                        therefore, it would not meet the problem of loyalty and reliability. Again
                        he expressed the view that the projected increase of 16,000 men and the
                        infusion of new equipment would represent no military buildup. He expressed
                        the hope that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MWBJ1">Macomber</persName>
                        would be endowed with the necessary authority to “expand the list.”</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that the US response had been developed in the context of
                        three constraints: (1) availability of items, having in mind the heavy US
                        requirements in Southeast Asia and Europe; (2) the financial cost to the US,
                        having in mind the continuing downward congressional pressures on the <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> budget; and (3) the heavy cost to Jordan
                        arising out of a substantial enlargement of its armed forces. With respect
                        to point (3), he alluded to a “partnership relationship” between the US and
                        Jordan, and said that partners must restrain each other from irresponsible
                        acts. <persName corresp="#p_KGA2">General Khammash</persName> said he could
                        only repeat that he was “honest,” and that his requests represented “bare
                        minimum needs.”</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that we agree in principle on the necessity of some pay
                        increase for enlisted personnel, but we want to discuss with Jordan how the
                        funds can be found, and also how Jordan proposes to finance the purchase of
                        the ground equipment and the F–104s under existing agreements. He said that
                        these would be among the matters which Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MWBJ1">Macomber</persName> would be prepared to discuss in
                        Amman.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_KGA2">General Khammash</persName> asked whether the
                        Secretary had yet seen his own paper assessing the current situation in
                        Jordan. The Secretary replied in the negative, and <persName corresp="#p_KGA2">General Khammash</persName> then presented him with a
                        paper which he had prepared after his arrival in Washington.<note n="2" xml:id="d367fn2">The paper, undated, bears a notation that <persName corresp="#p_KGA2">Khammash</persName> gave it to <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> during their meeting. (Ibid.,

                        said that the US earnestly desires peace and stability in the Middle East.
                        He said that he hoped sometime to visit Jordan “as a tourist.” <persName corresp="#p_KGA2">General Khammash</persName> assured him that we would
                        be welcome “in office or out.” The Secretary concluded the meeting by
                        reiterating the US view that King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> has acted with courage, wisdom and restraint; that
                        we believe the US package represents a substantial and prompt response; and
                        that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MWBJ1">Macomber</persName> will be
                        departing Washington on 14 December to pursue the entire range of
                        outstanding problems with the King and the Government of Jordan.</p>

                    <p>In a meeting of December 13, 1966, between US Secretary of Defense Robert
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and Major <persName corresp="#p_KGA2">General Amer Khammash</persName>, Chief of Staff,
                        Armed Forces of Jordan, the Secretary of Defense made the following
                        points:</p>
                    <p>1. The US understands and shares the great concern which the Israeli action
                        of November 13 has caused the Government of Jordan. The US has notified the
                        Government of Israel, in the strongest terms, of its concern and of the
                        serious implications of US-Israeli relations should there be a recurrence.
                        The US has strong reason to believe that the attack at Samua does not
                        presage a change in Israeli policy.</p>
                    <p>2. The US appreciates the unfortunate effect which the raid has had on
                        Jordan's sense of security and on the morale of the Jordan Armed Forces. The
                        US fully recognizes the important role the armed forces play today, and must
                        play for some time to come, in the maintenance of Jordanian stability and
                        security. The US is especially aware of the need to assure the armed forces
                        that adequate measures are being taken respecting their basic equipment,
                        organization and pay; and also to increase the visible defense of Jordan's
                        border villages. The <pb n="721" xml:id="pg_721" facs="0753"/>US is prepared
                        to provide prompt and meaningful assistance to meet these needs.</p>
                    <p>3. The US is seriously concerned however about the financial implications of
                        Jordan's projected force goals and indicated equipment requirements.
                        Security is vital, but it can never be absolute; moreover, it is rarely a
                        function of the size of armed forces, but is more often a function of their
                        quality and spirit. It could be a tragedy for all concerned if the
                        Government of Jordan were to embark upon a military buildup which later
                        events proved to have been an incommensurate response, and for which
                        resources were shown to have been inadequate.</p>
                    <p>4. The US believes it would be wiser for Jordan to concentrate on qualitative
                        factors designed to improve the firepower, mobility and communications of
                        its forces, rather than to embark upon a force expansion at this time. The
                        US must ask the Government of Jordan, as a condition of further assistance,
                        to forego any manpower increases until it can discuss more fully with the
                        King and his advisers the financial implications of any force expansion.</p>
                    <p>5. The US notes the Government of Jordan's view that some increase in the pay
                        of enlisted ranks is required in the present circumstances. The US agrees in
                        principle, but would want to discuss this matter with Jordan to determine
                        how the necessary resources could be found.</p>
                    <p>6. The US has already accelerated the delivery of certain items in the
                        current program as a first step in our effort to meet the problem facing the
                        Government of Jordan.</p>
                    <p>7. The US is now prepared to deliver (by airlift to the extent feasible) an
                        additional quantity of material within the next 30–60 days as set forth in
                        the Annex hereto. The US regards this additional material as representing a
                        very substantial and forthcoming response. It requires diversions from US
                        forces and from the forces of several allied and friendly countries. It is
                        designed to meet the indicated priorities of the Jordan armed forces and at
                        the same time to constitute a sufficiently prompt and dramatic manifestation
                        of US support to meet the psychological problem facing King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>.</p>
                    <p>8. The 6 F–104 aircraft listed in the Annex will be provided on a loan basis
                        from the United States Air Force inventory, pending the availability of the
                        planes originally designated for Jordan. These latter aircraft will be
                        available for substitution beginning in July 1967, as agreed between the two
                        governments, and will constitute a more modern and powerful version of the
                        F–104 A/B than the loan aircraft.</p>
                    <p>9. Jordan must recognize that the United States is constrained from meeting
                        its full requests by their adverse financial implications for both the
                        United States and Jordan, and their adverse implications for a Middle East
                        arms race, which the United States does not wish to stimulate.</p>
                    <pb n="722" xml:id="pg_722" facs="0754"/>
                    <p>10. The US notes the intention of the Government of Jordan to proceed with
                        the purchase of ground equipment under the US-Jordan agreement of 1965 and
                        to exercise the option to procure additional F–104 aircraft under the
                        US-Jordan agreement of 1966. The US is fully prepared to honor these
                        agreements, provided that the Government of Jordan can give satisfactory
                        assurances that the necessary funds for their purchase and support will
                        continue to be forthcoming from sources external to Jordan. This is in
                        accordance with the terms of both agreements. In this connection, the US is
                        prepared to give strong diplomatic support to Jordan's efforts to obtain the
                        necessary funds from sources such as Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, but cannot
                        contemplate a change in the terms of the contracts.</p>
                    <p>11. The US will continue to keep under close study the situation in the
                        Middle East and the requirements of the Jordanian armed forces. The US is
                        prepared to send a special emissary to discuss with the Government of Jordan
                        a number of questions, including (a) the relationship of recent events to
                        the limits on Jordan's budget as defined in the several US-Jordan
                        agreements; (b) the optimum size and appropriate equipment of the Jordanian
                        armed forces; (c) the levels of external assistance likely to be available
                        from traditional sources; and (d) what role the US might usefully play in a
                        Jordanian effort to develop supplementary financial support from other Arab
                        states which have an important stake in the continued integrity and
                        stability of Jordan.</p>
                    <p>12. The US reaffirms its admiration for the manner in which the King and the
                        Government of Jordan are facing the hard problems created by recent events,
                        and extends renewed assurances of US friendship and support.</p>

                    <p>President Johnson raised the subject of Jordan and Israel during a telephone
                        conversation with <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Arthur Goldberg</persName> at
                        5:40 p.m. on December 13, 1966. After discussion of unrelated subjects, he
                        asked <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> if “they” had checked
                        with him about Jordan and Israel, stating that he had told them not to do
                        anything for India, Pakistan, Jordan, and Israel without checking with
                        him.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> replied that they had, that
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> had given Johnson a
                        memorandum of the conversation (presumably <ref target="#d365">Document
                            365</ref>) and that he was seeing Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> on December 16.</p>
                    <p> Johnson said, “What we'll do is, the proper time, we won't be chintzy with
                        them, we'll go back to Africa or something else. We can't make a deal, but I
                        just think they're damn fools to let that <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> get thrown out.”</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> replied, “Well I think they
                        know that, and I'll be glad to talk to them.”</p>
                    <p> Johnson indicated his approval, and after brief comments on unrelated
                        subjects, the conversation concluded. (Johnson Library, Recordings and

                            from <persName>Saunders</persName> to <persName>Rostow</persName>
                            expressed his “disquiet” at the handling of the “Jordan package.” He
                            stated that although the package was small and defensive and represented
                            the minimum necessary to meet King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>'s political requirements, the delay in reaching

                            as a reliable friend, and downgraded his stature in the King's eyes.
                            Such details, he commented “do not receive the attention they deserve
                            when the President writes the details of the scenario.” He complained
                            that <persName>Rostow</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> had had “to rush off to New York on a

                            community, and asked, “Is there no way to stiffen the President's will
                            and enliven his memory concerning all we have already done for Israel,

                    <p>4. It essential that King not take action inconsistent with existing
                        relationship between US and Jordan as emotional reaction to report received
                        from <persName corresp="#p_KGA2">Khammash</persName>. If you have any reason
                        believe that King will take steps toward establishment Military Directorate
                        for West Bank or other action detrimental our objectives, you should advise
                        him that we believe this would have very serious consequences for Jordan and
                        might seriously complicate US-Jordan relations.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_MWBJ1">Macomber</persName> has pressed hard for no
                        increase but for a substantial improvement in quality. <persName corresp="#p_KGA2">General Khammash</persName> wants an increase of
                        10,000 from the present 50,000 on deck to 60,000. However, <persName corresp="#p_MWBJ1">Macomber</persName> believes the King is under
                        pressure to increase numbers as well as quality—his generals do not find it
                        credible that they can meet the threat from <hi rend="italic">both</hi>
                        Israel and Syria without a numerical increase. (<hi rend="italic">Note:</hi>
                        The United Arab Command's plans for Jordan implied a total strength of
                        75,000 including an 8,500 national guard. The Government of Jordan has
                        authorized a strength of 55,000, but had not gone farther than 50,000, a
                        level we had never formally agreed to.) <persName corresp="#p_MWBJ1">Macomber</persName> believes a 2,000-man increase is reasonable to
                        absorb the new equipment we are adding. He hopes to hold the line at that.
                        But if he can't, he feels the pressure is strong enough to warrant taking
                        out a small insurance policy by accepting a 5,000-man increase, but for one
                        year only.</p>

                        the Jordanian defense budget of some $54 million. We have been providing a
                        declining level of budgetary support ($37 million in 1962, $32 million in
                        1966). We have told Congress that we are continuing to reduce this support.
                        And we had planned cuts of $5 million a year beginning this year.</p>
                    <p>DoD estimates that apart from the costs of the <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> package the add-on costs are as follows:</p>
                    <p>1. pay raise: $6 million</p>
                    <p>2. 2,000 men to handle new equipment: $2.5 million</p>
                    <p>3. 3,000 men to 55,000 total: $3.5 million</p>
                    <p>Total: $12.0 million</p>
                    <p>Where will this $12 million additional come from?</p>
                    <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_KGA2">Khammash</persName> says he can cover these
                        costs for one year out of <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> funds (though
                        we are somewhat skeptical).</p>
                    <p>2. Saudi Arabia and Kuwait could be tapped by Jordan, with our backing, in
                        the event the <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> contribution does not come
                        through (but we're already expecting them to pick up the $70 million balance
                        from the tank and plane sales and therefore can't expect much more).</p>
                    <p>3. We ourselves could scratch our $5 million cut in budget support, and might
                        put in some additional contingency fund if necessary (though this would
                        undercut the important goal of shifting Jordan to development funding).</p>

                    <p>1. Concluded negotiations with King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> afternoon December 21. In course of this and earlier
                        meetings we have come to following understandings:</p>

                        predicated on this assumption and aimed primarily at easing current
                        situation, rather than dealing with longer term threat of revised

                        out that dramatic effort to strengthen Jordan army along lines of <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> package was happening in apparent
                        conjunction with introduction of foreign Arab troops into Jordan. While

                        incompatible with Jordan's own interests. He cannot <pb n="729" xml:id="pg_729" facs="0761"/>give an absolute guarantee that he will be
                        able to keep foreign troops out of his country but he does guarantee to the
                        President that he will do all he can to keep them out.</p>
                    <p>4. The King has committed himself to hold increase in current actual force
                        levels (50,000) to an increment of 3,000. He wishes President to know that
                        he understands and shares US concern for escalating troop strength. He asks
                        him to understand, however, that some increase at this time is absolutely
                        essential. He also wishes to personally assure the President that at
                        earliest opportunity he will try to cut back his troop strength. He has
                        specifically agreed one year from now to reexamine need for additional 3,000
                        troops in light of political and financial conditions existing at that
                        time.</p>
                    <p>5. King intends to continue his moderate policies and measures to enhance
                        area stability. In this connection, Jordan will persist in its efforts to
                        prevent terrorist infiltration into Israel.</p>
                    <p>6. King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> understands that
                            <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> is fully prepared honor US-Jordanian
                        sales agreements of 1964 and 1965 provided <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> can continue to meet payments on schedule from funds
                        obtained from sources external to Jordan. He understands also that US not
                        prepared to alter terms of these agreements. He knows we are willing to give
                        vigorous diplomatic support to <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> effort
                        obtain necessary funds from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. He is fully aware, too,
                        our position that any funds obtained from such sources or from <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> would be applied first to meeting <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> obligations under US purchase agreements
                        and would be available for general support of <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> forces only after US obligations met. (In early February
                        King plans to visit Saudi Arabia and Kuwait in search of funds; and in March
                        will go to Libya for same purpose.)</p>
                    <p>7. With respect to option to purchase 24 additional aircraft,<note n="3" xml:id="d373fn3">After extensive U.S.-Jordan discussions in early 1967
                            on this subject, <persName corresp="#p_BFJ2">Burns</persName> reported
                            in telegram 2938 from Amman, April 12, that he met with <persName corresp="#p_KGA2">Khammash</persName>, who was authorized by the
                            King to conclude the revision of the F–104 package. The Jordanian
                            Government was exercising its option for 6 additional F–104s and planned
                            to exercise its option for the remaining 18 aircraft in March 1968.
                            Delivery of the 18 aircraft currently on order was to begin in July 1967
                            and continue through June 1968. Delivery of the next 18 aircraft was to
                            begin in March 1969. Payment due in 1967 on the ground package and the
                            first 18 aircraft would be $26.5 million, with the possibility of
                            deferring $2 million until 1968. (Ibid., DEF 19–8 US–JORDAN)</note> King
                        understands that we are prepared interpret “on or about January 1” liberally
                        and that we believe it would be preferable wait to exercise this option
                        until he has, with our support, obtained necessary funds from Saudi Arabia
                        or Kuwait. In any event, he understands if <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> exercises option in January, payments totalling 5.4 million
                        will have to be paid in January to <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> and
                        that these obligations would have prior claim on <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> funds over their use to finance any increase in force
                        levels.</p>
                    <pb n="730" xml:id="pg_730" facs="0762"/>
                    <p>8. King understands that we acquiesce on enlisted men's pay raise of
                        magnitude of twenty-five percent. In our agreeing to this, he understands
                        that we will take raise into account in later negotiations for a new ceiling
                        in Jordanian military budgetary expenditures to replace current 19.2 million
                        dinar limitation.</p>
                    <p>9. I have informed King that under difficult political and financial
                        circumstances he facing <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> will not proceed
                        with all $5 million projected cut in our budget support for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 67. I have therefore indicated that, subject
                        to Congressional appropriations, our budget support payments for the coming
                        year will be reduced to $27 million rather than to $25 million. Also
                        indicated that in restoring a portion of our cut I would have to make it
                        clear that all our budget support for forthcoming year would be subject to
                        57 percent special letter of credit arrangement as we had earlier informed
                        his government.</p>
                    <p>10. On basis of foregoing I have also told <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> that we will deliver the equipment listed in
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> package and make every
                        effort to airlift a substantial portion of this equipment to Jordan in next
                        30 to 60 days. I have indicated that it will not be possible to augment
                        package to extent he and <persName corresp="#p_KGA2">General
                            Khammash</persName> requested in our first meeting, but have given him
                        list of machine guns, radios and communication wire, as spelled out <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 104754,<note n="4" xml:id="d373fn4">Dated December 18. (Ibid.)</note> noting that we were prepared to add
                        these items to initial <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                        list. King expressed disappointment that package still did not include
                        upgunning of M–48 tanks. He understands, however, that while this request
                        can be considered on another, later occasion, it is not part of our current
                        package.</p>
                    <p>11. While indicating disappointment that other items had not been added to
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> package, King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> said that present package
                        dramatically flown in to Jordan will help situation here “very, very
                        much.”</p>
                    <p>12. King believes that advance loan of six F–104's, and their presence here
                        will be most helpful. I have confirmed that we will attempt to deliver them
                        to Jordan in course of January and early February. King understands that
                        when American pilots are piloting the planes they will be used only for
                        training of Jordanian co-pilots. He has also guaranteed that every effort
                        will be made to avoid these planes coming into combat with any of Jordan's
                        neighbors as long as they are being serviced on ground by US personnel, even
                        when they are being piloted by Jordanians. Additionally, he is aware that if
                        other foreign aircraft should be stationed in Jordan while the F–104's are
                        still here on a loan basis, we will have to reexamine question of whether
                        they should remain.</p>
                    <pb n="731" xml:id="pg_731" facs="0763"/>
                    <p>13. We have agreed on proposed text for public announcement of package along
                        lines suggested <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 106068,<note n="5" xml:id="d373fn5">Dated December 20. (Ibid.)</note> with paragraph added

                        <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> would like to make
                        announcement Friday morning Amman time and agrees with us that numbers and
                        types of equipment should not be revealed publicly.</p>
                    <p>14. In course my final meeting with <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> on December 21, we also discussed tactics of
                        forthcoming Cairo meeting as well as King's current thinking with respect to
                        changes in his government. These discussions reported in <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 1569.<note n="7" xml:id="d373fn7">Dated December 22. (Ibid.)</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>15. After returning to office and dictating foregoing, I received call from
                        Prime Minister Tell who said he and <persName corresp="#p_KGA2">General
                            Khammash</persName> had talked to King re agreement which we had reached
                        and must see me at once. We met at Embassy residence and meeting began with
                        my reviewing point by point all key language of agreement spelled out paras
                        2–12 in this telegram. Prime Minister and <persName corresp="#p_KGA2">Khammash</persName>, in an intense and emotional effort, made in the
                        next two hours one last try to obtain further concessions. While much of old
                        ground again gone over, main thrust Tell-<persName corresp="#p_KGA2">Khammash</persName> argument was that U.S. response was not enough and
                        that by our failure to be more forthcoming we were denying Jordan minimum
                        necessary support needed at this critical time. They asserted that King's
                        sense of courtesy masking depth of his disappointment and that their own
                        disappointment was “many times greater” than the King's.</p>
                    <p>16. Tell argued pay raise, which King pretty much committed to after meeting
                        with officers previous evening, would not be possible. (I went over figures
                        to show that it would be.) Tell also suggested that it might have been
                        better to head off pressures for troop build-up by deciding not to take U.S.
                        package and instead going ahead with plans to accept foreign troops into
                        Jordan. <persName corresp="#p_KGA2">Khammash</persName> felt King, after
                        last night's meeting with officers, was also committed to much larger troop
                        build-up than would now be possible. <persName corresp="#p_KGA2">Khammash</persName>, in very emotional state suggested that he might
                        not be able carry on. (Unless he calms down, I suspect he may resign in next
                        day or so, as he did once before on a similar occasion. If so, I believe
                        King will be able persuade him withdraw resignation.)</p>
                    <p>17. Throughout meeting I made it absolutely clear that while recognizing
                        sincerity of their appeal we had come to the end of the line. I added,
                        however, that in view of their comments, I thought I should <pb n="732" xml:id="pg_732" facs="0764"/>contact His Majesty to see whether he was
                        having second thoughts about the agreement we had reached. At that point
                        Tell interjected to say that there was no question about going back on the
                        deal, that it had been made and it was too late now for it to be unmade.
                        Shortly thereafter, when Tell and <persName corresp="#p_KGA2">Khammash</persName> finally concluded that there was in fact no more
                        give in my position meeting ended.</p>
                    <p>18. While I have no doubt there was considerable sincerity in this eleventh
                        hour effort on the part of Prime Minister and Chief of Staff, I believe that
                            <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> while disappointed is not
                        as deeply disappointed as they are suggesting. Further I believe that under
                        the circumstances we have made about the right deal.</p>
                    <p>19. When I returned to the office I found waiting for me to carry back to
                        Washington a very courteous and appreciative letter to the President from
                        King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>. Text of letter follows
                        by separate telegram.<note n="8" xml:id="d373fn8">Telegram 1571 from Amman,

                    </p>
                    <p>20. My continued presence here now will only raise false hopes that there is
                        in fact further give in my position. I have said goodbye to King and will be
                        leaving Amman for Washington morning 22nd.</p>

                    <p>107579. 1. Under Secretary saw Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> morning 22nd to inform him that US agreement provide
                        additional arms Jordan would be announced at 10:00 p.m.<note n="2" xml:id="d374fn2">The texts of the announcement and a background briefing
                            given by a Department of State spokesman on December 22 are in circular
                            telegram 107544, December 22. (Ibid.) The text of the announcement is
                            identical to that in telegram 1572 from Amman (see <ref target="#d373fn6">footnote 6, Document 373</ref>).</note> He noted
                        difficulty of balancing <pb n="733" xml:id="pg_733" facs="0765"/>between
                        King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>'s need to maximize our
                        effort publicly and Israel's desire to see it minimized.</p>
                    <p>2. Under Secretary said package as described earlier except for very small
                        number additional light arms such as M–1 rifles and machine guns.</p>
                    <p>3. The King was committed to hold his increase in forces to 3,000 men and has
                        agreed one year from now to re-examine need for these additional troops.</p>
                    <p>4. King has assured us he will continue his moderate policies and measures to
                        enhance area stability including efforts to prevent terrorist infiltration
                        into Israel.</p>
                    <p>5. King has guaranteed that he will do his best to keep foreign Arab troops
                        out of Jordan, although he stressed he could not make an absolute guarantee
                        that he would be successful.</p>
                    <p>6. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> thought reaction
                        in Israel would be low-key, although this would depend somewhat on the level
                        of publicity given the agreement here and in the area. The action would not
                        of course be welcomed. <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>, in fact, thought
                        we were doing more than circumstances required.</p>
                    <p>7. Nevertheless, <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> understood our position
                        and welcomed (a) the candor with which we have dealt with them on this
                        problem; hoped this would continue on all matters; (b) King's determination
                        to continue moderate policies; (c) continuance of efforts control terrorism;
                        and (d) our assurances that we would be helpful to Israel on border control
                        equipment and other matters.</p>
                    <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> said he returning this
                        weekend to Jerusalem to participate in discussion of general balance in the
                        area. He thought that <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> comment on Jordan
                        deal would be limited to statement along lines that matter would be studied
                        and if military imbalance involved, Israel would move to correct it.</p>
                    <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> suggested it would be useful
                        if fact that no tanks or additional aircraft are involved could be leaked to
                        press here. Also, he hoped that no reference to Israeli knowledge of or
                        acquiescence in package would be made.</p>
                    <p>10. In later conversation with <persName corresp="#p_DRP1">Davies</persName>,
                        Minister <persName corresp="#p_EE1">Evron</persName> said Israeli Consul
                        General New York had been fully briefed yesterday and instructed to allay
                        concern among Jewish community leaders. Since <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> proceeding Israel via Miami Beach, we assume he will
                        contact others of leadership there.</p>

                        reconsider carefully its stand on <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>
                        safeguards. Drawing particularly from <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss>, I stressed importance we give to this matter, our
                        confidence and reasons therefore that <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>
                        system inspection need not endanger <pb n="736" xml:id="pg_736" facs="0768"/>Israeli security or reveal commercial secrets, and our view that
                        unilateral Israeli accession to <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>
                        safeguards would be positive contribution to world peace, raising esteem in
                        which Israel held in world and working in Israel's own self interest.</p>
                    <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName>'s response centered about three
                        points: (A) “national dignity” (B) national security (C) domestic political
                        considerations.</p>
                    <p>3. Re (A) national dignity. <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName>
                        objected to Israel's being asked to give up something while the same demands
                        were not being levied on <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. He rejected
                        idea that somehow Israel “owed <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                        something” in this matter. Israel's own peaceful disposition on area nuclear
                        matters had been made abundantly clear in recent statements by himself (<hi rend="italic">Realite</hi> interview and “Meet the Press”) and by Israel
                        Delegation in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. His researches showed him
                        he said that a basic premise of arms control agreements was mutual
                        recognition of sovereignty, right to existence of partners in agreements.
                        There seemed to be no disposition on part <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> make such elemental concession in case Israel. Instead one
                        only heard talk of war of liberation. He wondered whether <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> was not seeking do too much to increase
                        range of assurances to <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and not taking
                        sufficient account Israel's concerns. He said Israel's hopes for progress in
                        this problem rested largely on the achievement of general non-proliferation
                        treaty.</p>
                    <p>4. In my rejoinder I emphasized we not pushing Israel to take action under
                        assumption Israel owed <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> anything. Rather
                        we felt this was something Israel could do that would serve its own self
                        interest and broader interests world peace. Nuclear variable lent whole new
                        dimension to Middle East arms race and was regarded by us with utmost
                        seriousness. We were not asking Israel to do anything we would not ask
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, though in case latter, in view
                        paucity its nuclear facilities, this almost academic question at this
                        time.</p>
                    <p>5. As for possibilities general non-proliferation agreement we were hopeful,
                        but its prospects were uncertain and we could not rely on it solely as a
                        check to M.E. race at this stage.</p>
                    <p>6. Re (B) national security. In response my question <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> said that nuclear facilities in plural
                        he had referred to in conversations Nov 2 were various components of Dimona
                        complex and there no others. <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> concerned
                        that details of Dimona lay out would become known to <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> through inspections and thence through important Egyptian
                        presence at <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> headquarters. Inquiry had
                        been made to Israeli reps in Vienna and consultations undertaken with
                        experts in Israel and both agreed inspection carried substantial security
                        risk.</p>
                    <p>7. I countered with reminder that under <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>
                        procedures <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> would have say in who
                        inspectors would be and that Israel's presence or lack thereof on <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> Board of Governors would not affect
                        protection it would enjoy in this respect.</p>
                    <pb n="737" xml:id="pg_737" facs="0769"/>
                    <p>8. Re (C) domestic political considerations. <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName>'s point here was closely related to “national dignity”
                        argument. He asked how <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> could explain to
                        Israeli people if it were to unilaterally accede to <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> inspection while the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                        does nothing. Israeli people would wonder where national equality was
                        then.</p>
                    <p>9. I suggested that Israeli people might very well understand such an action
                        as we would: as a logical next step in the unilateral reassurances that
                        Israel has already given to world about its nuclear intentions. It might
                        even be argued that such unilateral action would be more palatable to
                        Israeli public opinion than a bilateral agreement with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, though I recognized that bilateral
                        agreements would ultimately be desirable.</p>
                    <p>10. <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> said that he would again
                        consult the <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> and experts on the
                        various technical problems. He agreed to take up with <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> the suggestion that my next meeting
                        on this subject be with both of them. <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> suggested that we consider putting in writing future
                        exchanges on the subject. I said I hoped we would not formalize our
                        discussions to this extent at this stage. It seemed to me that if we felt we
                        needed to put things in writing we could use informal bout de papier
                        procedure. He agreed.</p>
                    <p>11. In parenthetical remarks near end of discussion of subject <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> expressed <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> satisfaction with talks with Ambassador Bunker. Said <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> feeling was that water is essential aspect
                        of desalting project not nuclear power. Any means technically feasible to
                        get required water would be satisfactory to Israelis.</p>
                    <p>12. I closed with expressed hope <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> would
                        give this subject careful priority attention it merited. <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> said he would be in touch as soon as he
                        had had further discussions.</p>

                    <p>The Secretary opened the conversation by stating we were not yet in a
                        position to give a reply to Egypt's outstanding request for food assistance.
                        He had not had a chance to discuss the matter with the President. The
                        Secretary adverted to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName>'s presentation of December 29.<note n="2" xml:id="d378fn2">A memorandum of the conversation is ibid.</note> We had thought about
                        many of the points he had raised and felt it might be useful to go a little
                        further in the present discussion.</p>
                    <p>As to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>'s request for food assistance,
                        the Secretary said this problem raised large questions having to do with
                        food supplies and specific questions in terms of applicable US legislation.
                        He felt that in his previous conversation, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> had tended to discount the large
                        question. The Secretary referred to the Indian situation and said that we
                        were disappointed at the limited responses of other countries to India's
                        needs. We must get out of the position of being held responsible on a
                        bilateral basis for food supplies. In 18 months we had shipped over $1
                        billion worth of wheat to India. When it became apparent we could no longer
                        maintain assistance at this level, there was an adverse reaction. We had
                        sent Egypt a great deal of food. When it becomes difficult for us to
                        continue we are accused of waging a war of starvation. We must get out of
                        that context.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary referred to the problems created by the Findlay Amendment and
                        Egypt's trade with Cuba and the need for Presidential determinations.<note n="3" xml:id="d378fn3">Section 103 (d) of the Food for Peace Act of 1966
                            (Public Law 89–808, approved November 11, 1966; 80 Stat. 1526) forbade
                            the sale under Title I of P.L. 480 to any nation trading with Cuba or
                            North Vietnam except under certain circumstances if the President
                            determined the sale was in the U.S. national interest, and forbade the
                            sale under Title I of P.L. 480 to the United Arab Republic unless the
                            President determined it was in the U.S. national interest.</note> We had
                        been disappointed in the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>'s reaction to
                            <pb n="739" xml:id="pg_739" facs="0771"/>our request to exercise the
                        option to purchase rice in accordance with the terms of the previous PL 480
                        agreement. The Egyptians seemed to feel that we had let them down by even
                        asking that this be done.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said we did not know how much or on what terms the Soviets were
                        giving food assistance to Egypt, but we welcomed this kind of help. He hoped
                        that the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> would give him the necessary
                        priorities to food production in relation to its total resources.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> said that this was an
                        important meeting and that he wanted our help. He did not want to create a
                        crisis in US–<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> relations. The Near East
                        was now in a crisis situation and he wanted to work with us as a friend. He
                        didn't wish to leave the room until agreement could be reached as to what
                        should be said to Cairo. He felt embarassed by imposing on the Secretary's
                        time but he felt most sincerely that the situation was very serious. He felt
                        a deep sense of responsibility toward history. He had not come to ask for
                        wheat in the pursuit of Egyptian or Arab interests but to participate in the
                        protection of American and Western interests and the preservation of peace
                        in the area. He said that prevention was better than cure.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador said that for six months he had been giving tranquilizers to
                        Cairo. His little pharmacy was now exhausted. President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> was following these discussions very
                        closely. The Ambassador then reviewed his well-known list of actions taken
                        by the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> over the last year which he felt
                        should be read as signals of Egyptian desire to improve relations with the
                        United States. He went on to say that there could be no peace in the area in
                        the absence of a workable relationship between Washington and Cairo. There
                        could be no peace in the area and the cold war would never finish if Egypt
                        lost its position of non-alignment. The Near East was more important and
                        more dangerous than Vietnam. Egypt could not be non-aligned if the US didn't
                        do anything. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> had instructed
                        him to say that the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>'s wheat supplies
                        were very limited. The 250,000 tons en route from the Russians would last
                        for a short time and the additional 400,000 tons were not yet under active
                        discussion. What would be the effect in Cairo if after a month the Egyptian
                        people came to believe the US was exposing them to famine—not <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, not the government but the Egyptian
                        people? If wheat did not flow, the cold war will flare up. The Ambassador
                        said he must have an answer. Egypt must have wheat. Failure to get it would
                        cause the greatest repercussions on all our relations and interests in the
                        Near East and even on US relations with the Soviet Union. This was a more
                        important matter than the Soviet arms to Egypt or the Aswan Dam. It was
                        indeed the most important decision the US had faced with respect to the Near
                        East since World War II.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked if he could pose a personal question. How could he
                        interpret to his Cabinet colleagues or to Chairmen of Congressional <pb n="740" xml:id="pg_740" facs="0772"/>committees the point that unless we
                        provide food something bad would happen as anything but a threat? They would
                        react strongly to threats. As to Egypt's orientation or non-alignment wasn't
                        this something that Egypt could control?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> countered by asking if we were
                        talking in theoretical or practical terms. He believed that threats and
                        blackmail were inelegant and improper. If he were asked this question by
                        members of the Cabinet or Congressional chairmen he would reply by stating
                        that it was in the American interest to keep the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> non-aligned. This needed more than speeches. Otherwise
                        there would be greater and intolerable pressure on Egypt from the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked why Egypt really needed so many arms from the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> replied because of Israel. Israel was there. Why would
                        the US need more arms against the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>?
                        Only time would improve the Arab-Israel situation. Decades were needed and
                        an essential element was good US–<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                        relations. This would permit the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> to
                        build up its own confidence. Presently we were doing the contrary. If there
                        were no wheat there would be more tension in the area.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked if the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>'s military
                        leaders were apprehensive of an attack from Israel, why was Egypt
                        maintaining such large forces in Yemen? <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> replied, “Who knows who brought us to Yemen and who
                        knows who will bring us into other situations if you leave us?”</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked how it happened that this responsibility for feeding
                        Egypt had been concentrated on the United States.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> said we should look upon our
                        ability to give food aid to Egypt as a blessing. Egypt would not require any
                        more help after two or three years. If we listened to him the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would disappear from the Middle East and
                        an Israel settlement would become possible. There was no reason why Egypt
                        should be forced to succumb to the pressure of a great power close to its
                        borders.</p>
                    <p>There followed some discussion as to how the Ambassador should report the
                        conversation to Cairo. It was agreed that something along the following
                        lines could be said: <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> saw
                        Secretary for 70 minutes January 12. Most of discussion was taken up with
                        wide-ranging exploratory and useful discussion current problems in <gloss target="#t_NE1">NE</gloss>, many of which had been raised by <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> in his December 29 meeting with the
                        Secretary. Re <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> wheat request, the
                        Secretary informed Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName>
                        that pressure of business relating to opening of Congress, State of the
                        Union message, and other matters had not permitted him complete necessary
                        consultations. These consultations presently going forward. It was hoped
                        that there could be another meeting with Ambassador within about ten
                        days.</p>

                        current situation in Near East with Secretary (at lunch) and Acting

                            reported that the Lebanese Government accepted the P.L. 480 proposal but
                            requested a larger program at a lower interest rate and accepted the

                    <p>3. Hakim said GOL's intention was to protect Intra's creditors to maximum
                        extent possible but that it could not give any creditors consideration more
                        favorable than that given others. He said preliminary auditors report on
                        Intra would be ready in about one month and its substance could be conveyed
                        to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PDJ1">Porter</persName>. He said that it

                        informed judgement could be made on whether Intra to be refloated or

                        be considered separately from Intra problem, that <gloss target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss> had not been party to Intra transactions and in fact at

                        Lebanese traders. He said he hoped <gloss target="#t_CCC1">CCC</gloss>

                        especially because Lebanon closest of all Arab states to U.S. policies and

                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>'s informal
                        message to you this morning<note n="2" xml:id="d380fn2">See <ref target="#d382">Document 382</ref>.</note> makes it plain that the
                        Israelis are not going to repeat the mistake they made in November. Our
                        reaction to their raid on Jordan shook them badly. This time, they're
                        carefully warning us that their patience with Syria has about run out.</p>
                    <p>Despite <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>'s restraint, Israel is
                        either on the brink of another attack or is pushing us to curb Syria.
                        Israeli Charge Evron warned State this morning that “continuation of Syria's
                        policy would force Israel to take action.”<note n="3" xml:id="d380fn3">In a
                            meeting with Acting Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HWJ1">Handley</persName> that morning, <persName corresp="#p_EE1">Evron</persName> delivered an oral message stating in part, “The
                            continuation of this aggressive policy will force Israel to take action
                            in self-defense as is her international right and national duty.”

                        <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> said about the same publicly.</p>
                    <p>Since the first of the year, the Israelis have built a full record in the
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> of Syrian-based attacks. To strengthen
                        their case further, they've accepted U Thant's appeal for an emergency
                        meeting of the Israel-Syria Mixed Armistice Commission. This costs little
                        since press reports suggest that Syria will reject or sidestep the
                        appeal.</p>

                    <p>We probably can't stop the Israelis from another attack without laying our
                        whole relationship on the line. We've offered border control equipment for
                        them to test, but any system is months off. However, we're pulling out the
                        stops short of a showdown to encourage continued restraint:</p>

                            File, United Arab Republic, Vol. V.</note> Much of what he said was a
                        repeat of his familiar analysis of how important it is that the US maintain
                        a position in Cairo over the next 3–4 years until oil revenue put the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> on its own feet. Essentially, he made two
                        points:</p>
                    <p>1. The importance of a US decision on food aid within the next ten days. He
                        had obviously absorbed Mr. <persName>Rostow</persName>'s Saturday<note n="4" xml:id="d381fn4">January 14.</note> admonition that it was time he
                        stopped describing Cairo's acceptance of Soviet wheat as a threat to the US
                        and started thinking of it as a threat to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. He made very clear that, in painting the specter of
                        Moscow's filling the Egyptian wheat gap, he was not threatening the US but
                        simply stating a fact of life—that a sick man needs moral support from more
                        than one quarter.</p>
                    <p>2. His three-part plan for progress in the Middle East which he had outlined
                        to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> but not to Mr.
                            <persName>Rostow</persName>:</p>
                    <p>—Keep the Israeli issue in the icebox.</p>
                    <p>—Achieve a modus vivendi among the Arab governments:</p>
                    <p>(a) Use the good offices of the US to further the Kuwaiti mediation of the
                        Yemen dispute;</p>
                    <p>(b) Do what we can to help reestablish British relations with the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. He explained this second point as relevant
                        to the first in that the British have substantial influence in Saudi Arabia
                        and can do a lot to break down the animosity between <persName corresp="#p_FAAAS1">Faisal</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>.</p>
                    <p>—Maintain a workable economic relationship with the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, including encouraging the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> to help. He
                        described the importance of this in ways that do not sound like a threat but
                        they come close. As he put it: Just as no government can expect to have good
                        relations with any nation in the western hemisphere without the approval of
                        the US, so is it true with the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> in the
                        Middle East.</p>
                    <p>He raised again the proposal he had made to Mr. <persName>Rostow</persName>
                        on Saturday of our sending to Cairo another mission like the Ed Mason
                        enterprise several years ago.<note n="5" xml:id="d381fn5">Economist Edward

                                <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1961–1963, vol. XVII,
                                Document 230</ref>.</note> He felt that, if we agreed to a new round
                        of food aid, he could sell this to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>. When he asked what I thought of the idea, I said I
                        felt it could be useful if it connoted a willingness on the part of the
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> government to adopt more pragmatic
                        economic policies and to consider the analysis of western economists.</p>
                    <p>In general response I told him I felt he was addressing two points not
                        necessarily wholly related. First is the political element of our response
                        to <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> food requests. Contrary to some
                        impressions that <pb n="745" xml:id="pg_745" facs="0777"/>might be logical
                        in Cairo, our delay in deciding should not be read as political. Second, I
                        felt that our delay had to be read in the context of our broader concern
                        over the world food problem.</p>
                    <p>I explained how the US and the world are going through a transition in their
                        thinking about agricultural development and food aid. Washington in
                        particular in the last three months had been coming to grips with this new
                        situation in a way that almost required delaying any decisions on food aid
                        until we had sorted out our position on the worldwide problem. I realized
                        the difficulty of convincing Cairo that preoccupation rather than
                        premeditated neglect could be a reason for our delay, but I felt this was
                        much closer to the truth and hoped he could convince his government.</p>
                    <p>When I turned the discussion to Syrian-Israeli relations, he had little to
                        offer in the way of interpretation but did volunteer that he had cabled
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> yesterday that the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> should do what it could to restrain Syria.
                        I told him we appreciated that because we were very much concerned that the
                        Israelis might launch another strike if terrorist activity continued, and
                        especially if it cost another Israeli life. He diverted the discussion to an
                        exposition on how the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> had been quite
                        responsible on the Israeli issue. I agreed that it had been better than some
                        of its neighbors and hoped that in this instance it could do all in its
                        power to avert another blowup.</p>
                    <p>In parting, I left with him the two <gloss target="#t_USDA1">USDA</gloss>
                        paper-back books on the world food problem and outlined to him the new facts
                        about the world food situation as we see it. He ended by reiterating his
                        plea for a US decision “within 10 days”.</p>
                    <p>He retained his composure throughout, but was more emphatic than I had ever
                        seen him.</p>

                    <p>120440. 1. Following is text of “piece of paper” delivered January 16 by
                            <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> Embassy to White House, described as
                        message from Premier <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> to
                        President Johnson but bearing no salutation or signature line:</p>
                    <p>“Today I took a most difficult decision—not to authorize a military reaction
                        to the brutal Syrian provocation which took place yesterday morning.
                        Terrorists from Syria mined the village of Dishon and put anti-personnel
                        mines on a football ground. A young man was killed and others wounded. This
                        outrage came as a climax to a period of sustained Syrian aggression which
                        included the following acts over the past ten days: wholesale penetration of
                        the Israeli side of the frontier; attacks with light arms on our farmers
                        inside and outside the Demilitarized Zone; bombardment of Israelis on
                        sovereign Israel territory with tank shells; laying of mines in roads and
                        fields, and totally unprovoked shooting on Israeli vessels on Lake Tiberias
                        which is Israeli territory.</p>
                    <p>Through all this period we kept our reaction to the minimum and tried to
                        avoid escalation. The country is seething with indignation. It seems that
                        Syria wishes to appear as the champion of anti-Israel militance, and to
                        embroil it in the aggressive policy.</p>
                    <p>If we have decided not to act today it is because we still hope that Syria
                        will understand the danger of her present course.</p>
                    <p>Since we agreed to be in close and frank contact I felt bound to share my
                        deep concern with you.”</p>
                    <p>2. Embassy should deliver following message in response either through
                        Foreign Ministry or Prime Minister's office. Message should be prepared in
                        style similar to <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> text, i.e., on plain
                        paper without <pb n="747" xml:id="pg_747" facs="0779"/>salutation or
                        signature lines. Text follows: “Thank you for writing to me candidly about
                        the present difficult situation on Israel's northern border. I respect the
                        courage you have shown in dealing with it.</p>
                    <p>I was saddened to learn of the fatality caused by the mine explosion at
                        Dishon. We share Israel's sorrow about this senseless and brutal act.</p>
                    <p>I want you to know how fully I appreciate the painful dilemma that you and
                        your colleagues face in coping with continuing acts of terrorism along
                        Israel's borders. No government can be expected to adopt a passive attitude
                        toward incidents that threaten the lives and properties of its citizens. The
                        tragedy is that the search for security can lead to actions which,
                        perversely, threaten to destroy chances for the permanent peace we all seek
                        and which thus in turn pose a serious dilemma for this government. I am
                        therefore particularly gratified by your decision not to authorize military
                        retaliation. I say this, believe me, in full appreciation of how difficult
                        that decision must have been for you. I am convinced, however, that there
                        are, fortunately, alternatives to military retaliation that in the long run
                        will provide Israel with a greater measure of security. Your government and
                        mine are already engaged in discussions concerning possible ways in which
                        technology we are developing might help strengthen the capability of the
                        Israeli border forces to intercept infiltrators. I believe this to be a
                        promising approach, and I can assure you of our continuing interest in
                        seeing this program go forward.</p>
                    <p>I earnestly hope that your government will continue to meet the present
                        situation with the same high statesmanship which it has so frequently
                        displayed in the past under trying circumstances. We believe that the
                        evidence from years past demonstrates that military retaliation is not the
                        answer to this problem. We have already seen enough of the present pattern
                        of events in the Middle East to realize that armed reprisals not only fail
                        to put a halt to terrorism, but on the contrary, strengthen the radical and
                        irresponsible forces in the Arab societies that provide a favorable climate
                        for terrorist activities.</p>
                    <p>I am encouraged by the initiative of Secretary General U Thant in calling
                        attention to the present dangerous situation along the Israel-Syria border
                        and asking both the Israeli and Syrian Governments to agree to an emergency
                        meeting of the Israel-Syria Mixed Armistice Commission. I welcome your
                        government's initial favorable reaction to his proposal. I hope that your
                        government will be flexible about the details of the emergency meeting in
                        the interest of furthering the overall objectives of relieving tension on
                        the border.</p>
                    <p>We have instructed our Ambassador in Damascus to approach the Syrian
                        Government urgently to call attention to the dangers of the situation, to
                        stress our belief that acts of terrorism within Israel are a <pb n="748" xml:id="pg_748" facs="0780"/>major factor threatening the peace, and to
                        urge full cooperation with the Secretary General's appeal.</p>
                    <p>Let me once again assure you of my personal close attention and deep concern
                        for Israel's security.”<note n="2" xml:id="d382fn2">Telegram 2421 from Tel

                        to point finger at Syria as responsible for terror attacks. He hoped that
                        Syria would not be allowed to “fuzz” situation by taking position it could

                    <p>The Under Secretary noted that there were two sides to this approach.
                        Therefore calling attention to actions and Syrian responsibility could have
                        opposite effect from that desired. Acts have been carried out in such a way
                        that Syrians can reap credit domestically yet deny responsibility in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. We have urged the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to take action and are giving strong support to its efforts.

                        there considerable risk in Israeli inaction in face of terrorism, greater

                        almost quiescent from 1957 to 1965. There were indications of Arab
                        realization that Israel was here to stay and now Arab solidarity seems well
                        along the way to complete breakdown. The fixing of world attention now on
                        the need to keep Israel's borders quiet could defuse a very dangerous
                        situation.</p>
                    <p>The Under Secretary undertook to look into Israel's military requests and to
                        continue weighing the desirability of a stronger USG public statement on
                        terrorism.</p>

                        for the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. These consolidate the <gloss target="#t_IRG1">IRG</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss>
                        decision <pb n="750" xml:id="pg_750" facs="0782"/>and the dissenting views
                        of AID, E and H in a range of four alternatives with back-up rationale.

                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> continues to press for
                        a decision on his government's PL–480 request. He is again attempting to put
                        off Cairo by telling them you have been too busy testifying on the Hill to
                        finish up the consultations necessary to get a decision this week on this
                        important and delicate matter. While he agrees that setting a time limit is
                        not helpful, he says his government is growing ever more insistent for an
                        answer. Thus he has reported to Cairo that he hopes to get the decision from
                        you this week. This position remains the same, though more and more
                        emphatic, that a negative decision would be a catastrophe, benefitting only
                        the Soviets and those seeking confrontations and polarization in the Near
                        East area to the detriment of western and moderate interests.</p>

                    <p>That you authorize us to negotiate a new six-month PL–480 agreement with the
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> in accordance with one of the
                        following alternative proposals:</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Alternative A</hi>: A $68 million program containing
                        250,000 tons of wheat, 500,000 tons of corn and/or milo and some vegetable
                        oil, tobacco and tallow. Dollar repayment over ten years, two year grace
                        period, US Treasury rates. This would assist us in maintaining tolerable
                        relations with the <gloss target="#t_UARG1">UARG</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Alternative B</hi>: A $52 million program containing no
                        wheat but all of the other commodities in A above on the same dollar
                        repayment terms. The prospect of future US wheat assistance would be held
                        out <pb n="751" xml:id="pg_751" facs="0783"/>to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. This might still be attractive enough to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and indicate our desire to minimize policy
                        differences.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Alternative C</hi>: A $25 million program containing
                        250,000–300,000 tons of wheat, with the remainder made up of other
                        commodities. Dollar repayment over fifteen years, no grace period, US
                        Treasury rates. This could be acceptable to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> provided the preconditions attached to A and B above are
                        sufficiently watered down.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Alternative D</hi>: A $16 to $17 million program of
                        250,000 tons of wheat, just matching the recent Soviet wheat aid. The <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> might accept on credit terms of A above and
                        provided there were no preconditions. However, this further shortening of
                        the leash might well be counterproductive in terms of hopes for improved
                            US–<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> relations.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Discussion:</p>
                    <p>Opinion is divided on this difficult and complex foreign relations problem.
                        This is reflected in the spread of alternatives. The issue is where the
                        balance falls—i.e., on the side of consequences to our Near East interests
                        or with the unfavorable repercussions on Congressional attitude toward both
                        food and dollar aid. PL–480 legislation requires that you determine it in
                        the national interest to make concessional food sales to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Alternatives A and B represent the decision of the Inter-departmental
                        Regional Group for Near East and South Asia. Considerations underlying this
                        decision are: A negative or inadequate US response will be taken by Egypt as
                        a challenge. The reactions of Egypt, the most powerful Arab country, can be
                        detrimental to our interests, especially in the current increasingly tense
                        and unstable Near East scene. There are few major situations in the area
                        where we do not bump into Egypt and its influence. Recent American oil
                        discoveries in Egypt have added new dimensions to that country's economic
                        future and our interests there. Egypt has some influence in less developed
                        areas where we contest with the Communists for position.</p>
                    <p> US–<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> relations have not changed for the
                        better since we ended PL–480 assistance in June. But time has run out on
                        keeping Egypt's April 1966 request on ice as was indicated by <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s reference to a “starvation war” in
                        a recent major speech. The implications of this long delay have had some
                        beneficial effects in terms of increased Egyptian concern with its food and
                        population problem and of signals from <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, through private American and foreign government
                        contacts, of a desire for better relations. Offer of a modest PL–480
                        program, in terms of <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> needs, will
                        preserve at least the minimum effective US–<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> relationship, maintain some of our influence in Cairo, keep
                        up the hope of those around <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
                        who favor good relations, continue to offer an alternative to
                        ever-increasing reliance on the Soviets and <pb n="752" xml:id="pg_752" facs="0784"/>provide an umbrella for cooperative Egyptian pound programs
                        in the critical areas of agricultural production and population control.</p>
                    <p>There will be adverse reactions to renewed PL–480 assistance from some
                        leaders friendly to us in the Middle East area and from certain elements in
                        Congress, but, on balance, <gloss target="#t_IRG1">IRG</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss> decided such criticism would be less
                        disadvantageous to US interests than the probable foreign policy effects of
                        not doing so. A fuller explanation of this rationale is set forth in
                        Enclosures 1 and 2,<note n="2" xml:id="d384fn2">The enclosures, all unsigned
                            and undated, are not printed. Enclosure 1 is entitled “Rationale for the
                            Decision of the Interdepartmental Regional Group for Near East and South
                            Asia Re PL–480 for the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>.” Enclosure 2
                            is entitled “Comments of the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence
                            and Research Re PL–480 for the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>.”</note> including the conditions precedent to a new PL–480
                        agreement.</p>
                    <p>Alternatives C and D reflect concern with domestic reaction. AID, with the
                        endorsement of the Economic Affairs and Congressional Relations Bureaus of
                        State, believes that the disadvantages of further loss of Congressional
                        support for the Administration's foreign aid programs outweigh the possible
                        advantages to US foreign policy interests of a new PL–480 program with the
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. AID is skeptical that Egyptians
                        will starve if PL–480 is not available, and that such assistance affects
                        Egypt's long-run policies toward the US and the Near East area. (By
                        contrast, the <gloss target="#t_IRG1">IRG</gloss> and Intelligence and
                        Research Bureau assessments indicate that the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>'s long-term non-alignment policy is vulnerable to full
                        dependence on the Soviets, that there is some scope for <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> changes of policies to avoid confrontations
                        with the US, and that alleged starvation could be made into an issue.) If a
                        decision is made to go ahead on foreign policy grounds, AID and the Economic
                        Bureau believe the program should be kept sufficiently limited ($25 million)
                        so that Congress can be shown we are still pursuing a “short leash” policy
                        toward the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. The Congressional Relations
                        Bureau believes that the opposition in Congress is so strong that no PL–480
                        program of any size should be initiated at this time. To the catalogue of
                        Egyptian activities that incense some members of Congress may soon have to
                        be added charges, yet unsubstantiated, of <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> use of poison gas in Yemen. A fuller explanation of these
                        positions is set forth in Enclosures 3, 4 and 5.<note n="3" xml:id="d384fn3">Enclosures 3, 4, and 5 consist of comments by AID, the Bureau of
                            Economic Affairs, and the Bureau of Congressional Relations,
                            respectively.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>Alternative D would undoubtedly be the easiest to live with from the domestic
                        standpoint, but it would be too small to support any preconditions much less
                        maintain a minimum effective relationship with the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. While it would match the 250,000 tons of Soviet wheat
                        actually agreed to, it does not take into account the additional Soviet <pb n="753" xml:id="pg_753" facs="0785"/>offer of 400,000 tons which
                        apparently remains open but not yet agreed upon.</p>

                    <p>126458. 1. Dept officer informed Israeli Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> and Minister <persName corresp="#p_EE1">Evron</persName> Jan 26 that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> had now completed certain plans related to our earlier
                        decision to accelerate F–104 deliveries and training for Jordan. In next few
                        weeks we would be sending 6 F–104s to Jordan on temporary basis. These would
                        be US Air Force planes, would be maintained by US Air Force personnel and
                        would be withdrawn as Jordan's own F–104s were delivered. We were taking
                        this step within context our effort achieve maximum psychological impact in
                        Jordan through rapid and visible response to King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>'s request for assistance. While in
                        Jordan, aircraft would be used for training Jordanian pilots and ground
                        crews.</p>
                    <p>2. Dept officer stated that this action would be presented publicly as
                        integral part of our December commitment to accelerate training and delivery
                        F–104s for Jordan. We did not intend to initiate publicity and would not
                        comment on status of aircraft or details our arrangements with <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss>. We wanted <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> to know, however, that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                        had taken every precaution to assure that there would be no incidents
                        involving these aircraft; specifically, they would not be flown in border
                        areas. Dept officer stressed that this and other details being very closely
                        held and requests <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> do likewise.</p>
                    <p>3. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> said this
                        information would be helpful to Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> in calming fears which presence these aircraft <pb n="754" xml:id="pg_754" facs="0786"/>in Jordan might arouse. At same
                        time, noting <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>'s concern re publicity
                        currently being accorded to airlift in Jordan, <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> urged that arrival of F–104s be kept in low key. In
                        addition, he urged early favorable response to <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> request for delivery of eight rather than presently
                        scheduled four A–4F's to Israel in December (<persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName>

                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> Vice President <persName corresp="#p_MZ1">Zakaria Muhieddin</persName> evening Jan 31. It can
                        only be described as somber. <persName corresp="#p_MZ1">Muhieddin</persName>
                        marshalled his considerable resources of inner strength, charm, intelligence
                        and last, but by no means least, quiet determination. Highlight of
                        discussion was opening statement by <persName corresp="#p_MZ1">Muhieddin</persName> who had obviously been very well briefed on
                        previous <persName corresp="#p_BDC1">Bergus</persName> conversations with
                            <gloss target="#t_UARG1">UARG</gloss> officials (<gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>, Presidential Adviser Al-Khouli,
                        DePriMin <persName corresp="#p_FM5">Fawzi</persName>, et al). <persName corresp="#p_MZ1">Muhieddin</persName> neatly and effectively summed up
                        these several hours of conversation in few minutes.</p>
                    <p>2. He was not optimistic over future of US–<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> relations. He believed <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                        had made substantial contribution toward containment Arab-Israel dispute. He
                        thought <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> had demonstrated its objective
                        was to maintain truly independent nonaligned position. <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> had welcomed American economic interests in
                        development its oil resources realizing that for “many years at least”
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, as other Arab countries, <pb n="755" xml:id="pg_755" facs="0787"/>needed American capital, know-how,
                        and accessibility to Western markets.</p>
                    <p>3. He felt that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has not brought itself to
                        recognize forces of change at work in Arab world. <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> shared US desire for stability in area and did not “export
                        revolution.” (Comment: Muhieddin and other Egyptian interlocutors have been
                        quite sensitive on this point.) But US seemed to feel it could best protect
                        its interests by aligning itself with Arab leaders such as <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> and Feisal (with much heavier
                        emphasis on latter) who determined resist change. Feisal was doing his best
                        promote US–<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> confrontation and apparently
                        succeeding in his effort. Both Feisal and <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName> seemed convinced that time had come work openly and
                        otherwise to cripple if not destroy present <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> regime. US, willy-nilly, had let itself become party to
                        these efforts.</p>
                    <p>4. Primary theater of confrontation was, of course, Yemen. <persName corresp="#p_MZ1">Muhieddin</persName> frankly stated that objective Jan
                        27–28 Najran bombings had been bring physical and moral “pressure” on Feisal
                        to desist from anti-<gloss target="#t_YAR1">YAR</gloss> activities.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MZ1">Muhieddin</persName> clearly implied such
                        attacks on Saudi Arabia would continue despite <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>'s full awareness that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                        might react.</p>
                    <p>5. He acknowledged that <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> economic
                        situation was not good, that serious mistakes had been made in the past, and
                        that the next couple of years would not be easy. He made it clear that
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> would use its scarce hard currency
                        resources purchase wheat and maintain relationships with “cooperative”
                        creditors. Debt payments to others such as <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> or <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> were obviously of
                        lesser priority. He was pessimistic re new <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> stabilization
                        agreement.</p>
                    <p>6. On wheat he spoke little and mostly in terms of resentment which US
                        behavior in this field has created in India. He did not play on <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> theme of US “war of starvation.” He
                        did however seem to believe there was something sinister in <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>'s lack of response to <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> requests for assistance. US, in his view,
                        was trying string along Egyptians, perhaps as part of its strategy support
                        activities Feisal and Hussein rather than giving clear-cut answer.</p>
                    <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_MZ1">Muhieddin</persName> believed that US–<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> relations were at their lowest ebb since
                        1952. Things were even worse than during period 1956–59 crises in Near East.
                        He felt that basic regard of Egyptian people for <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> and Americans had survived foregoing without much
                        difficulty. But he thought that it inevitable that animosity toward US would
                        develop throughout Egyptian society and that restoration of friendship would
                        not come quickly or easily. (Comment: This theme used by <persName corresp="#p_FM5">Fawzi</persName> and others.)</p>
                    <p>8. Throughout conversation <persName corresp="#p_BDC1">Bergus</persName> and
                        Parker did their best point out fallacies and contradictions <persName corresp="#p_MZ1">Muhieddin</persName>'s position. They drew heavily on
                        Secretary's conversations with <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName>
                        and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BLD2">Battle</persName>'s continuing
                        discussions with <gloss target="#t_UARG1">UARG</gloss> leadership. They
                        stressed conviction <pb n="756" xml:id="pg_756" facs="0788"/>that <gloss target="#t_UARG1">UARG</gloss> assumption that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> had changed its basic policies toward Egypt and area was
                        both erroneous and dangerous. While ensuing discussion with <persName corresp="#p_MZ1">Muhieddin</persName> was hardly a “dialogue of the
                        deaf” neither do we believe that there was much impact on him.</p>
                    <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_BDC1">Bergus</persName> and Parker left with
                        impression <gloss target="#t_UARG1">UARG</gloss> becoming increasingly
                        convinced that broad US–<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> confrontation is
                        unavoidable. There is little basis for believing that Egyptians any longer
                        flinch at such a possibility. In Egypt, as elsewhere in this part of world,
                        there is strong streak of fatalism.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>1. (S) Reference is made to a memorandum by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of
                        Defense (<gloss target="#t_ISA1">ISA</gloss>), dated 20 January 1967,
                        subject as above, which requested the views of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on
                        an Israeli request for military assistance on a grant aid basis.</p>
                    <p>2. (S) The Joint Chiefs of Staff do not consider that grant military aid to
                        Israel is justified by the internal or external threat. In addition, neither
                        the need for insuring Israel's pro-Western orientation nor Israel's economic
                        condition justify such aid. Provision of grant aid to Israel would not be in
                        consonance with established <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> policy and
                        would be contrary to US interests in the Middle East. For additional
                        information on the adverse effects of a grant aid program, see Appendix
                            A.<note n="2" xml:id="d387fn2">Neither Appendix A nor B is printed.
                            Appendix A, unsigned and undated, is entitled “Advisability of Grant
                            Aid/Sales to Israel.”</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>3. (S) Israel's present military forces are capable of defending successfully
                        against any individual or collective Arab attack; currently programmed arms
                        shipments to Jordan and expected deliveries to other Arab states do not
                        affect this capability materially. Israel's superior <pb n="757" xml:id="pg_757" facs="0789"/>offensive and defensive capabilities would
                        be improved by acquisition of 200 modern armored personnel carriers, but
                        this improvement is not needed at the present or in the next three to five
                        years to insure Israel's security.</p>
                    <p>4. (S) Aside from the basic questions of grant aid and Israel's security
                        needs, providing armored personnel carriers to Israel in CY 1967 would
                        either delay programmed deployments to Southeast Asia, further degrade our
                            <gloss target="#t_CONUS1">CONUS</gloss> position, or require diversion
                        from existing commitments to other countries. Moreover, a US agreement to
                        sell additional major items of military equipment to Israel is not advisable
                        since it would:</p>
                    <p>a. Negate the effect of the US warning to Israel in the wake of its recent
                        attack on Jordan.</p>
                    <p>b. Aggravate the current unstable internal situation in Jordan.</p>
                    <p>c. Serve to establish further the United States as the primary supplier of
                        military equipment to Israel.</p>
                    <p>d. Provoke adverse Arab reactions.</p>
                    <p>e. Further contribute to the Arab-Israel arms race with the United States
                        supplying both contestants.</p>
                    <p>5. (S) M–113A1 <gloss target="#t_APC1">APC</gloss>s are also produced in
                        Italy under the US/Italian coproduction project; however, sale to Israel

                        Attache to consider our draft Memorandum of Understanding<note n="3" xml:id="d388fn3">Not found.</note> on US-Israeli cooperation in the
                        field of anti-infiltration technology. From this meeting, as well as from
                        other recent discussions with and public statements by Israeli officials,
                        there has emerged an Israeli position which may be summarized as
                        follows:</p>
                    <p>1. The application of electronic and other technological developments to the
                        problem of protecting Israel's borders against Arab clandestine penetration
                        attempts is not a new concept; Israel has been experimenting with this
                        approach for some years.</p>
                    <p>2. The Government of Israel is prepared to examine and test the latest
                        American devices and techniques to determine whether Israel can improve its
                        own effectiveness in this field. It is disappointed, however, with what we
                        have come up with so far and is not yet prepared to sign the proposed
                        agreement.</p>
                    <p>3. In any case this approach can never provide a complete answer to Israel's
                        security problem. To give it undue weight as part of a “static” defense
                        policy would limit Israel's sovereign right to defend itself by whatever
                        means it deems necessary. Even while Israel continues to practice military
                        restraint it must maintain a credible deterrent posture. This means that it
                        cannot permit the impression to be created that it has renounced the right
                        to choose the manner, place and time in which it will act to assure the
                        security of its borders. Politically, undue emphasis on anti-infiltration
                        technology would create a defensive, ghetto psychology that would encourage
                        increased Arab harassment and foster a defeatist attitude in Israel. Both of
                        these developments would constitute a setback to Israel's search for a
                        permanent settlement of the Arab-Israel problem.</p>
                    <pb n="759" xml:id="pg_759" facs="0791"/>
                    <p>4. Israel thinks the U.S.G. is overselling the anti-infiltration idea,
                        creating the impression that it can solve Israel's security problem. Israel
                        was particularly disturbed by the description of anti-infiltration
                        technology as an “alternative” to military reprisal in the President's reply
                        to Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>'s recent
                            message.<note n="4" xml:id="d388fn4">See <ref target="#d382">Document
                                382</ref>.</note> In the Israeli view this emphasis, which they also
                        see reflected in comments by various U.S.G. officials, suggests a
                        fundamental U.S. failure to understand the true nature of the threat Israel
                        faces. Those on the Arab side who advocate terrorism—the Syrian Government,
                        Palestinian extremists and their ideological mentors—must be shown that this
                        is a self-defeating doctrine before it becomes too deeply rooted to be
                        destroyed. By advocating “passive defense,” the United States is encouraging
                        the aggressor while asking the victim to limit his freedom of action.</p>
                    <p>We have endeavored to make clear to our Israeli contacts that we do not view
                        our cooperative anti-infiltration efforts as a cure-all, but rather as part
                        (one might say the U.S. component) of a more measured and precise response
                        to the type and level of threat Israel now faces than are massive
                        retaliatory raids of which Samu is the most recent example. The latter, in
                        our judgment, exacerbate rather than contain the problem. The raids
                        encourage the terrorists in their aim of goading Israel into intermittent
                        hostilities with its neighbors. Fundamentally, we do not believe that Israel
                        can achieve absolute security, so long as there is no peace between it and
                        its Arab neighbors, or that it can shoot its way to peace. We think military
                        retaliation is both ineffective and reckless and may in time give serious
                        substance to Palestinian terrorism which, despite some tragic successes, is
                        still a shadowy and relatively disorganized force.</p>
                    <p>At the same time we agree that efforts to improve Israel's anti-infiltration
                        capabilities should be carried out quietly, and we have accordingly
                        endeavored to avoid focussing public attention on them. The fact is that the
                        first official public acknowledgment of U.S.-Israeli cooperation under way
                        in this field came in a press conference by Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> on January 24. Israeli complaints that
                        we are overselling the anti-infiltration concept seem prompted primarily by
                        privileged references we have made in private forums to our joint efforts in
                        this field, in an attempt to reassure Congressional and other friends of
                        Israel in this country regarding our continuing interest in Israel's
                        security. We would therefore not rule out some degree of Israeli stalling in
                        getting the anti-infiltration device study into operation, but believe this
                        to be primarily for tactical reasons.</p>
                    <p>The Israeli Government, as you know, has argued that the United States
                        over-reacted to Israel's November 13 raid against Jordan. Israel <pb n="760" xml:id="pg_760" facs="0792"/>has also been clearly concerned that our
                        reaction to that raid would adversely influence our response to Israel's
                        requests for assistance in the economic and military field. Perhaps to
                        counteract this as well as to maintain world sympathy and concern for
                        Israel, Israeli spokesmen have made a concerted effort of late to dramatize
                        the current Arab terrorist threat to Israeli security. The present Israeli
                        tendency to downplay the importance of anti-infiltration technology, as an
                        answer to terrorism, would appear to be a part of that effort. Despite some
                        lack of enthusiasm in Israeli military circles, we do not interpret this as
                        an indication of official Israeli indifference to our anti-infiltration
                        proposals and believe we should continue to push those proposals quietly but
                        firmly.</p>

                                p.m. on February 14. Feinberg had requested an appointment with the
                                President before departing for Israel on February 18. (Ibid.,

                                President himself should lay the groundwork for this. (Ibid.,

                    </list>
                    <p>In preparation for your talk with Abe Feinberg, you ought to know where we
                        stand on this year's Israeli aid requests. State, Defense and AID are
                        putting them all together, and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> will have one package of recommendations for you in the
                        next two weeks.</p>
                    <p>My preliminary feeling is that aid for them will be tough this year and that
                        you may want to use your talk with Feinberg to lay the groundwork for a slim
                        response. We need not feel defensive about this since our aid in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1966 was the highest single year ever by 25%
                        because of the plane sale (see attached chart).<note n="3" xml:id="d389fn3">The chart is not attached.</note>
                    </p>
                    <pb n="761" xml:id="pg_761" facs="0793"/>
                    <p>The Israelis argue that they need continued help over the next 2–3 years
                        while they work their way through the austere economic measures necessary to
                        make them more competitive in European markets and help close their trade
                        gap. They point to their especially high debt repayments and their heavy
                        defense burden. But given their substantial foreign exchange reserves, some
                        of their points are exaggerated by normal aid standards.</p>
                    <p>These austerity measures have thrown Israel into a recession, which we expect
                        to be short-lived. The government allowed Israel's growth rate to slip to 7%
                        in 1965 (previously over 10%) but was shocked when it slumped to 1–2% in
                        1966. This is probably a main reason for their aid requests.</p>
                    <p>They've made six separate requests, totaling at least $75 million:</p>
                    <p>1. Grant military aid—$9.4 million. They've asked for 200 armed personnel
                        carriers and $2 million in spares for tanks we've already sold. They are
                        clearly trying to match our December Jordan package. Since their raid caused
                        that package, no one here wants to give in on this. Besides, we've never
                        given grant military aid to Israel, and no one feels we should break that
                        precedent, especially so soon after the Israeli raid. <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> sees no serious military requirement for
                        the <gloss target="#t_APC1">APC</gloss>s. However, <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> considers the <gloss target="#t_APC1">APC</gloss>s important, and we'll undoubtedly end up considering a
                        credit sale, though State and Defense oppose.</p>
                    <p>2. Credits of $14 million to buy maintenance items for Hawk missiles and
                        tanks. They want the same terms we gave on the 1962 Hawk sale (10% down, 10
                        years, 3.5%). Defense doesn't believe we should finance maintenance and, in
                        any case, couldn't come close to 1962 terms today. However, if you feel it's
                        essential to come up with some military help, there might be a little give
                        here with harder terms.</p>
                    <p>3. Development loans of $20 million. They got only $10 million last year
                        (plus $10 million Ex-Im), and we've already given them that $6 million left
                        over from <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1963. With today's even tighter
                        aid criteria it will be tough to justify any AID lending at all, though
                        Ex-Im loans are still possible. Even the Israelis know this request is
                        unrealistic.</p>
                    <p>4. PL 480—$32 million (same as last year). Congress has been increasingly
                        critical of highly concessional sales to Israel where per capita <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss> is already higher than in several European
                        countries. However, we could probably come up with $23 million on harder
                        terms, even without wheat.</p>
                    <p>5. Deliver 8 aircraft next December instead of the 4 now scheduled. We all
                        feel this would be desirable but, since these are new production items
                        needed in VietNam, we'll want to hear Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s final view.</p>
                    <p>6. An exception to AID policy to let Israel bid on AID-financed fertilizer
                        purchases for Korea and VietNam. AID will probably come <pb n="762" xml:id="pg_762" facs="0794"/>around on this since we can pay half in
                        dollars and half in excess Israeli pounds.</p>
                    <p>In addition, we have just agreed to increase their cotton textile quota by
                        35%.</p>
                    <p>In the background is desalting. Ambassador Bunker's report will be ready
                        shortly. His economic study<note n="4" xml:id="d389fn4"> Bunker enclosed a

                        $50 million would be required to produce water at realistic cost. He found
                        Eshkol more relaxed on the timetable than he had expected. It doesn't look
                        as if we'll be spending much money on this in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1967, but if we ever decide to go ahead, it will cost us
                        quite a bit. Of course, you will want to hear from Bunker before you say
                        anything to Feinberg that could be read as a commitment.</p>
                    <p>What this adds up to is that—with last year's high aid level behind and
                        desalting possibly still ahead of us—we ought to be able to make a low year
                        stick this year. Therefore, I'd propose leveling with Abe, explaining your
                        problems and asking his help in making them clear to others.</p>
                    <p>If you have a moment, it would be worth your time to skim the attached
                        description of the overall US-Israeli balance sheet.<note n="5" xml:id="d389fn5">The attachment, unsigned and undated, entitled
                            “U.S.-Israel Relations,” is not printed.</note> It was done for our
                        panel of outside consultants on Middle Eastern affairs who met here over the
                        weekend. It's a neat and straightforward statement of what we've done for
                        Israel and how our relationship has been pretty much a one-way street. You
                        might want to get this balance across to Abe as a means of letting him know
                        there are limits.</p>

                            discussion has been found.</note> the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>'s April 1966 request for a new PL 480 agreement. This is
                        the toughest—but the most important—decision facing us in the Middle East
                        today. Many of us—and <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s vice
                        president as well—feel we're rapidly sliding into a showdown. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> more and more sees us behind all his
                        troubles in the Middle East. To us, the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                        looks increasingly incompatible in interests, outlook and temperament.</p>
                    <p>Although Egypt needs the food, the real question is whether we try to
                        maintain a relationship with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>.
                        Last summer, we extended $70 million in <gloss target="#t_CCC1">CCC</gloss>
                        credit, but that's run out. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> tided
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> over with 250,000 tons of
                        grain—about five weeks' imports—and appears to have offered to help round up
                        another 400,000. Even that will leave the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> at least 600,000 tons short of its <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1967 grain needs. But entirely apart from food needs,
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> regards our decision as
                        the main indication of whether or not we're out to get him. We have little
                        else going for us, since our economic aid has shrunk to a little technical
                        assistance and school feeding.</p>
                    <p>One key question is whether abandoning the field would result in unchallenged
                        Soviet influence or whether <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s
                        own interest in maintaining his independence would bring him back to the
                        West. Many of our friends—some Israelis, British and Saudis—have urged us to
                        stand aside and let the full weight of <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s economic problems hem him in. His foreign exchange
                        is at rock-bottom, and he has even had to default his latest repayment to
                        the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>. Yet it was interesting to hear that
                        Israeli Teddy Kollek during his last trip here told Averell Harriman that we
                        should “keep our relations with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> open and not leave the field to the Soviets.” He felt
                        we had given <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> too much in the
                        past but hoped we wouldn't go to the other extreme now.</p>
                    <p>Since our effort over the past 5 years to get closer to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> has gained us little positive, it's
                        tempting to try the tougher line. But we've <pb n="764" xml:id="pg_764" facs="0796"/>received enough quiet signals from <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> through Bob Anderson and other
                        private Americans to make us wonder whether he isn't already as close to the
                        brink of complete dependence on Moscow as he can afford. Most recently
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s top military man has
                        invited a group of top-level US business executives to visit the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> this Easter. If he is trying to find a
                        western anchor again, it's hard to cut him adrift completely.</p>
                    <p>Why should we care?</p>
                    <p>We're all reluctant to picture the consequences of a break with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>. Arguing that line rubs us all the
                        wrong way because no one likes the idea of paying off a bully.</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, there are few major situations affecting our interests in the
                        Near East, where we don't bump in to Egyptian influence. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> could cut off important overflight
                        rights—as he has just done on our airlift to Jordan.<note n="3" xml:id="d390fn3">The <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> Foreign Office
                            informed the Embassy on February 12 that the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> Government had decided to cancel its previous

                        restraint on American trade. He can make plenty of trouble for friendly
                        regimes—and for us—in Jordan, Saudi Arabia or Lebanon. He could cause
                        trouble for our shipping in the Suez Canal, bring out the demonstrators
                        against Wheelus Base, stir up more trouble for Israel via the Palestine
                        Liberation Organization or even trigger the nationalization or harassment of
                        our oil companies.</p>
                    <p>More positively, <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> is still the
                        most powerful figure in the Middle East. At least out of respect for
                        Israel's power, he has restrained wilder Arabs who have pushed for a
                        disastrous Arab-Israeli showdown. Despite its mounting economic problems,
                        the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> has the trained manpower and the
                        will to modernize that will make it the most advanced nation in the area.
                        Two American companies have brought in promising oil finds, and the chances
                        of the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> becoming a substantial oil
                        exporter look good. It's hard to argue that we should burn all our bridges
                        with the capital of the Arab world.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> has been
                        considering four alternatives:</p>
                    <p>1. A $68 million agreement through June including 250,000 tons of wheat,
                        500,000 tons of corn and/or milo and some vegetable oil, tobacco and tallow.
                        Dollar repayment over 10 years, 2 year grace, US Treasury rates.</p>
                    <p>2. A $52 million deal with all the above except wheat. Same terms.</p>
                    <p>3. A $25 million program with 250–300,000 tons of wheat and the remainder in
                        other commodities. Dollar repayment over 15 years, no grace, Treasury
                        rates.</p>
                    <pb n="765" xml:id="pg_765" facs="0797"/>
                    <p>4. A $17 million program of 250,000 tons of wheat, just matching the recent
                        Soviet deal. Dollar repayment over 10 years.</p>
                    <p>This spread of alternatives reflects the division of opinion. The first two
                        are the choices posed by those concerned chiefly with the consequence for
                        our Near East interests. The last two reflect concern with domestic
                        reaction. AID and Doug MacArthur have predicted strong reaction on the Hill.
                        We would also expect strong reaction from our friends in the area. But while
                        I understand all the pressures for letting this decision ride, I have
                        watched our relations with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
                        closely since 1961 and am reluctant to see us close this door. Our
                        experience in Indonesia is strong argument for buying a little insurance
                        against a better day.</p>
                    <p>This program is not all political. The <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> is
                        a natural potential showplace to demonstrate what can be done in
                        agricultural production and population control. Its problems are as acute as
                        anywhere, and yet it has the homogeneous population, compact area and happy
                        combination of water, soil and climate to get relatively quick results. The
                        government is putting more into agricultural development, and so far in
                            <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1967, it has bought some 700,000 tons
                        of grain here on <gloss target="#t_CCC1">CCC</gloss> credit.</p>
                    <p>Time is running out, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName>
                        has seen Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> twice, and the
                        Secretary has promised to get him an answer. This need not influence our
                        decision, but in all fairness we ought to answer soon and not allow the
                        decision to drift any longer. Our purpose at lunch is to get a sense of your
                        priorities.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>, which summarized reports
                            suggesting that Israel's nuclear program might be moving at a faster
                            pace than previously indicated. (Ibid.) A February 17 memorandum from
                                <persName corresp="#p_DRP1">Davies</persName> to Bunker, outlining
                                <gloss target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss> views on the Israeli desalting
                            project, states, “Some recent intelligence reports suggest that Israel
                            may be constructing a chemical separation facility and proceeding so far
                            in the production of bomb components that assembly of a nuclear weapon
                            could be completed in 6–8 weeks.” It states, however, that pending a
                            fuller assessment, <gloss target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss> was inclined to
                            view these reports with reservations. (Ibid., E 11–3 ISR) In a March 9
                            letter to <persName corresp="#p_DRP1">Davies</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Barbour</persName> commented, “I was pleased to see
                            the <gloss target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss> paper's cautious appraisal of
                            recent alarming reports on Israel's nuclear activities and intentions.
                            Such caution is well placed. Moreover, my own impressions from such
                            information as is available to us is that Dimona is not running at full
                            blast.” (Ibid.)</note> describing conversations with two Israeli
                        contacts suggests Israel could be much closer to nuclear weapons capability
                        than we had supposed. We are requesting urgent assessment these and other
                        recent reports by Washington intelligence community. While we will reserve

                    <p>4793. 1. In farewell call Feb 23 on Anwar Sadat he remarked that US policy in
                        Middle East and particularly toward <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> even
                        worse than that of John Foster Dulles. Dulles had said flatly <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> broke and US had no intention of providing
                        aid. We dangled hope of aid and never gave answer while at the same time he
                        suspected we engaged in unfortunate behind scenes actions with enemies of
                        UAR as well as arming them. Our delay in response brought forth speech by

                        other than peace and security and no chosen instrument. Reviewed many
                        factors involved in world food problem. Pointed out that at various times we
                        were accused being more partial one Arab than another but accusations often
                        reflected inter-Arab differences. Arms sales to Jordan concerning which he
                        had expressed alarm had initially stemmed from <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> levying of requirements on Jordan. What had happened is
                        that events had changed relationships between Arabs and that what appeared

                    <p>5030. 1. I made farewell call which lasted one hour and ten minutes on
                        President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> March 4. After
                        exchange pleasantries during which he expressed regret my departure, I said
                        I wished reflect on some of my final conclusions and impressions as I left
                        this country where I had made many friends and in which I had had a very
                        rewarding tour of duty.</p>
                    <p>2. I said I was more convinced than when I came of the rightness of US goals
                        in the area. Seeking peace and stability as we do, we must attempt maintain
                        as friendly relations as possible with as many countries as possible. This
                        not an easy course. In large measure changes in relations Arab countries to
                        each other frequently resulted in suspicions re US motives and aims. For
                        example, I mentioned sales arms Jordan stemming from <gloss target="#t_UAC1">UAC</gloss> assessment defense needs that country, an arrangement which
                        Egyptians now appeared in some strange way view with suspicion. On Yemen,
                        Saudis suspected we more tolerant Egyptian attitudes than of their own and
                        Egyptians considered we supported Saudis. In truth we have no material
                        interest in Yemen and wish only see peaceful resolution that problem, which
                        is danger to relations between our friends the Saudis and our friends the
                        Egyptians. In accordance his instructions, Hassan Sabry el Khouly and others
                        his government have kept me fully informed re <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> efforts at various times resolve situation. I still hoped
                        way could be found bring about peaceful resolution this difficult area
                        problem. At various times Egyptians had indicated to me that if US wanted
                        solution Yemen problem, we should play more active role that direction. I
                        wanted to ask him today whether on my return Washington to assume broader
                        responsibilities for area relations I should urge my government offer join
                        in one of several offers mediate or take initiative on our own in that
                        direction.</p>
                    <p>3. President then launched into lengthy discussion Yemen, saying he had gone
                        to Jidda to conclude agreement Feisal against advice his colleagues and had
                        entered agreement “on my own responsibility”. As he landed for Jidda
                        meetings, he felt nervous and uncertain, but felt he must make effort
                        resolve conflict. Since that time many actions had entered into situation,
                        including Islamic Pact, Aden problem and other difficulties. He could not at
                        present be hopeful solution. Yemen operation not now costly to <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> although has been in past. <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> can remain indefinitely and will do so if
                        necessary. He was always interested offers <pb n="769" xml:id="pg_769" facs="0801"/>solution but not hopeful in view Feisal's arrangements
                        Jordan and in view their determination to view his earlier efforts as sign
                        weakness, which Jidda agreement had not in fact reflected.</p>
                    <p>4. I said I took it from his remarks that he would not oppose any efforts by
                        US if we thought we could be helpful but he did not appear hold out much
                        hope chance success any US efforts. He replied this was his attitude
                        although he appeared pause and be somewhat reflective in his response.</p>
                    <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> then launched into thirty
                        minute tirade of most emotional character yet displayed in my meetings with
                        him. He said <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> proud, independent country
                        with its own dignity. He had decided in thinking over my call on him to be
                        very frank and he hoped I would not take offense at anything he said, but he
                        must deal lucidly and frankly with issues. <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> would not respond US pressure. It did not want American
                        wheat. During time we had provided wheat he had gone to bed each night
                        disturbed that <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> dependent on US for food
                        and had resented each item in American or world press reminding <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> that five out of each eight loaves of its
                        bread were provided by US. <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> would not
                        accept interference by other countries. It was not influenced by Russia and
                        would not be. Whether he remained or not, attitudes <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> re its own independence would be consistent and those
                        lieutenants he trained would take same position as he took. <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> had no designs other countries contrary our
                        impression and our press but wanted, for example, Aden to be ruled by
                        revolutionary forces and not British stooges. Re Israel, his views are well
                        known. He hoped Arabs could return.</p>
                    <p>6. He then switched to <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>, asking why he
                        should pay <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> 104 million dollar debt when
                        it would not give him seventy million dollars to which he felt entitled. In
                        meeting in that room a few days ago, when some of his colleagues voiced
                        concern re <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> relations <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>, he had stated <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> must stand on own feet and if <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> and all Western Interests refused do business with <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> would
                        still survive and make progress. <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> would
                        have been better off if it had not in developing its economic plans based
                        those plans upon continued supply wheat which had distorted development
                        efforts by permitting broader program than justified. If any country
                        attempted hurt <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> would respond and no doubt could do damage US and other
                        countries.</p>
                    <p>7. I replied by asking his permission be as frank with him as he had been
                        with me, saying I would not under any circumstances wish offend him in my
                        last meeting but I must answer as frankly as he had on statements he had
                        made.</p>
                    <p>8. The US had entered into food arrangement, which admittedly had become
                        issue of its own between us, in hope providing help which would accelerate
                        development and be of help to Egyptian people. Based on his speeches, it
                        appeared he had given up hope continuing these arrangements <pb n="770" xml:id="pg_770" facs="0802"/>before I had and before Executive Branch
                        had completed deliberations on matter. During recent days, for example,
                        consultations had been under way with Congressional leaders, that
                        consultation had not been helped by his own statements and those of Heikal
                        with respect our relations and motives. (I mentioned specifically latest
                        Heikal article.)</p>
                    <p>9. He interrupted, saying he had given up hope of wheat several months ago
                        and reminded me that he had never before brought up wheat in conversation
                        with me and that I had always raised matter first. He could not approve
                        efforts his Ambassador Washington to obtain wheat in manner that appeared be
                        begging on knees.</p>
                    <p>10. I went on to say US Government and I personally respected need for <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> be independent, dignified country and we
                        wanted see it develop viable economy and we still hoped for success in those
                        goals and in his achievements and aims for his people.</p>
                    <p>11. He referred to fact that he owned several newspapers in Beirut and that
                        Saudis and Jordanians also had newspaper spokesman in area. Indicated he had
                        been restrained in his response many of their attacks on <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> but could only accept so much and had had
                        to respond to them.</p>
                    <p>12. I said that I wished remind him as I had in past that he was world figure
                        and that each utterance coming from him was read and interpreted throughout
                        world and that his remarks more important than newspaper stories one kind or
                        another. While this great compliment to his influence in world, it was also
                        responsibility to bear as I well recognized. I said there was no doubt
                        ability many countries hurt each other, including ourselves, but we must
                        find way to build lasting friendship which I was convinced both sides really
                        wanted. I hoped he could find satisfactory relationships <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> and with West. He replied, “If we cannot,
                        we will go on with other countries.”</p>
                    <p>13. In closing I repeated that US policy in area had not changed and that we
                        sought continued friendship <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and that
                        while I had not succeeded in removing suspicions and doubts and problems
                        from agenda, I had every intention in new assignment continue my efforts and
                        I hoped he would view future as long time indeed in which we would try
                        overcome various problems between US in relations often marked by such ups
                        and downs.</p>
                    <p>14. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> was more emotional than I
                        have ever seen him and at moments developed glaze over eyes typical of that
                        we have seen when he makes speeches. He was at all times extremely cordial
                        to me, very friendly and warm and at various moments of tirade against US
                        said not to take it personally. In view his attitudes re US mediation Yemen,
                        I cannot be hopeful. Suggest we wait few days, however, to see whether idea
                        picked up by lower level officials.</p>

                    <p> CAP 67111. Fresh from his stop in Cairo, Hal Saunders of my staff who is
                        quietly touring the Middle East<note n="2" xml:id="d394fn2">
                            <persName>Saunders</persName> visited the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Syria, and Israel. He reported
                            his conclusions in a May 16 memorandum to <persName>Rostow</persName>,
                            which <persName>Rostow</persName> forwarded to the President on May 17.
                            (Ibid., Name File, <persName>Saunders</persName> Memos)</note> has
                        reported the following.</p>
                    <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> should be told soon one way
                        or the other about wheat. It has come to symbolize our future intent toward
                        him and his regime.</p>
                    <p>2. Help on the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> negotiations is nearly as
                        important. Officials argue they've cut expenditures, have made real economic
                        achievements. Their self help performance is “relatively positive.”</p>
                    <p>3. No one in Cairo believes the Soviets and <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> are working hand in glove. There is parallelism of
                        policy, but Cairo wants to avoid Soviet control.</p>
                    <p>4. Because the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> is the chief power in the
                        Middle East, and modernizing rapidly, Saunders believes we should build some
                        kind of new relationship.</p>
                    <p>5. He doubts this can be done unless you and <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> meet somewhere to define your areas of common
                        interest and disagreement. He acknowledges the risks, but hopes we will
                        consider this carefully, since Cairo persists in seeing everything we do in
                        the area as directed against him—those not actively with him must be against
                        him. (WWR Comment: Perhaps a letter from you could do the job.)</p>
                    <p>6. Hal commends a cautious but revitalized policy to rebuild our position in
                        Cairo, avoiding equally the over-enthusiasm of the early 1960's and the
                        distrust of today.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Comment</p>
                    <p>We've shown this to Nick Katzenbach only. He plans to pursue wheat for the
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> a bit further on the Hill before
                        making a recommendation to you. Probably a small amount as a gift, about
                        matching the Soviet Union's 250,000 ton gift (which Ellender, among others,
                        seems to prefer over a credit sale!). We have some doubts on the timing,
                        because it may be seen both in Egypt and Arabia as a reward for raising
                        hell. But this will be looked into before the recommendation comes to
                        you.</p>

                    <p> Hal will be back in ten days, when we can go into the complex of Middle East
                        issues with a fresh look.</p>

                    <p>To the White House eyes only for <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt
                            Rostow</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_WWH1">Howard
                            Wriggins</persName>
                    </p>
                    <p>Following impressions my intensive talks in Cairo with Foreign Minister,
                        Treasury and Economy Ministers and others bear on your wheat decision.</p>
                    <p>First. We ought to say something to Egyptians about wheat soon one way or the
                        other. Dragging out line that we have food request “under consideration”
                        reaps all disadvantages of negative answer without gaining advantages of
                        keeping door open. Months of ambiguity plus other events Mid East have
                        convinced Egyptians we have cast our lot with other side and for that reason
                        have decided against wheat aid. They say bitterly that even Dulles gave them
                        an answer.</p>
                    <p>Second. Wheat decision unfortunately more than ever symbol our future intent
                        because it involves both development and human requirements. We would be a
                        lot better off if we could get off this wicket but for moment it looks as if
                        wheat alone can break stalemate. I think we might get away with dollar sale
                        as long as grace period long enough to cover next three years which
                        Egyptians see as period of real economic pinch. After that, they not
                        euphoric but do seem have reason hope oil and other slowly increasing
                        exports plus improved import substitution will begin pay off.</p>
                    <p>Third. To economic insiders, help in new <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>
                        negotiations almost as important as food decision. Main point made to me by
                        Nazi Deif and Hamed El Sayeh whom you met last fall is that they have
                        succeeded in bringing expenditures under control in six months since <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> talks began. Therefore new situation exists
                        here and Gunter Mission must come end March with some give its position.</p>
                    <p>Fourth. Despite political symbolism both these issues and contrary conception
                        created by usual intra-<gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> justification our
                        aid program in <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. This far from purely
                        political program designed bribe <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> keep out of our <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>.
                        Washington, especially the press and Congress, badly needs understand that
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> not just proverbial rathole down
                        which we pour our aid. All Washington fully aware foreign exchange bind.
                        Point not widely appreciated is degree to which this a place of real
                        achievement and sound planning. I now understand why World Bank relatively
                        optimistic despite gaps in execution. I well know weakness this argument in
                        offsetting <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s polemics, but it
                        important President know that self-help case relatively positive.</p>
                    <p>Fifth. I found no one Cairo willing assert that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> and Soviets working hand in glove. Soviet-like
                        political model adopted for pragmatic reasons since Western style democracy
                        not suitable <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s style. <pb n="773" xml:id="pg_773" facs="0805"/>Hard evidence any firm Moscow-Cairo
                        understanding lacking. Soviet influence and parallelism interests
                        substantial. But Egyptian desire avoid Soviet control is unanimous
                        impression.</p>
                    <p>Sixth. Because Egyptians are making honest development effort and do not look
                        like Communist tools, believe it still possible build some kind US–<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> relationship if we consider it worthwhile.
                        After seeing energy with which Egypt modernizing, I do not see how we can do
                        otherwise, though I recognize domestic pressures may tip judgment other way.
                        Common argument for relationship is that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> can cause us so much trouble elsewhere. This true but
                        in my view misses simpler main point that Egypt clearly chief power modern
                        Middle East.</p>
                    <p>Seventh. If we do want to sustain long-term US position Cairo, only sound
                        foundation I can see is eventual meeting between <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> and President. Because our contradictory interests in
                        Near East will always feed Egyptian suspicion we working against them, only
                        way establish accurate picture limits our objectives is for two Presidents
                        reach understanding each other's purposes and agree on inevitable areas
                        disagreement. I could see this working out much as President's understanding
                        with Ayub. I realize hard thought needed weigh risks for President against
                        disadvantages, but I am convinced as never before that wide gulf
                        misunderstanding unlikely be bridged any other way. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BLD2">Battle</persName> essentially agrees, though he wisely
                        cautious we should not try this unless we willing sustain followup.</p>
                    <p>My main reason for arguing this case is that our biggest problem in Cairo
                        today is that no amount of logic sufficient persuade Egyptians that
                        everything we do in Near East not directed at them. It amazing what shreds
                        of evidence they have woven together to prove this to themselves. These not
                        just debating points. Every official I talked to from Foreign Minister on
                        down obviously sincerely believes this. Main thread this fabric of illogic
                        seems be philosophy those not helping them must be against them.</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately, there just enough truth their evidence to make it difficult
                        refute. For instance, editorial and Congressional statements that get most
                        play made by people who have in fact chosen sides here. Even more damaging,
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> statement that tensions
                        in Middle East “sparked by <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>” considered
                        coup de grace in argument that we view Cairo as the enemy.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, if we wish stop drifting this part of world one major pillar
                        revitalized policy must be some effort rebuild in Cairo. Last five years
                        have taught us not go too far too fast or expect too much. Fortunately
                        international tools at hand in <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> and World
                        Bank study and not impossible try moving gradually to position we shooting
                        for in 1961–62.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>1. Your talk with Abe coincides with the arrival here of State-<gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> recommended response to recent Israeli
                        assistance requests.<note n="2" xml:id="d395fn2">A March 8 memorandum from
                                <persName>Rostow</persName> to the President states that Feinberg
                            came in that day after his return from Israel to report “a strong
                            feeling in Israel that we are shifting our policy away from them.”
                            Feinberg urged U.S. responsiveness on the Israeli requests, especially
                            by granting or allowing the Israelis to purchase 200 armored personnel
                            carriers and by providing credit for Hawk missile and Patton tank spare
                            parts. (Ibid.)</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>2. Abe has reported that exaggerated Israeli publicity on our shipments to
                        Jordan, pressures from Syria, and economic recession resulting from
                        overenthusiastic anti-inflationary measures have left the Israeli Government
                        nervous and discouraged.</p>
                    <p>3. You may wish to consider the following factors in assessing what we ought
                        to do for them this year:</p>
                    <p>(a) Their December raid on Samu precipitated our emergency military
                        assistance to Jordan, costing us about $9 million this <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> for defensive military equipment. The Joint
                        Chiefs hold this has not changed the military balance in the area. In sum,
                        the Israelis do not have much of a claim on us for the steps we took to help
                        sustain Hussein after their raid nearly brought him down. However, Nick and
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Arthur</persName> told the Jewish community
                        leaders we would take our increased commitment to Jordan into account “in
                        giving sympathetic consideration to Israeli requests for assistance.” While
                        we made no commitment to match exactly for Israel what their action at Samu
                        forced us to in Jordan, Arthur, under continuing pressure in New York, feels
                        strongly we should do nearly that.</p>
                    <p>(b) Israel has not yet given us permission to visit the nuclear plant at
                        Dimona. Our last visit was in April, although we had an informal
                        understanding that visits would be allowed every six months.</p>
                    <p>(c) They have not yet replied to your letter of May 21, 1965 to <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> urging acceptance of <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards.</p>
                    <p>(d) We have already increased our textile import quota by some 60%, a
                        concession worth $2.5 million in Israeli foreign exchange earnings.</p>
                    <pb n="775" xml:id="pg_775" facs="0807"/>
                    <p>4. State and <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> have recommended the
                        restricted package (items (c) to (f), below). Items (a) and (b) are
                        fall-backs suggested by State. Nick recommends that no package be agreed
                        until firm arrangements have been made for the next inspection of
                        Dimona.</p>
                    <p>(a) Sell 100 Armoured Personnel Carriers on commercial credit. (The Israelis
                        asked for grant assistance for 200 <gloss target="#t_APC1">APC</gloss>'s.
                            <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> recommends against supplying any
                            <gloss target="#t_APC1">APC</gloss>'s now, but State believes half their
                        request, on a sales basis, would be tolerable, and could be justified as
                        improving their border patrol capability. Value roughly $3.7 million.)</p>

                    <p>5. An important question is how we communicate this package, if it meets with
                        your approval. Ideally, it would be best to tell Feinberg none of these
                        details, but reserve them for official discussions with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName>. If possible, it would be best simply
                        to hear him out sympathetically, indicate that our careful studies are
                        nearing conclusion, and remind him of some of the steps Israel has not taken
                        to be helpful to us. But if you feel it necessary to tell him something, you
                        could indicate that some <gloss target="#t_APC1">APC</gloss>'s will be
                        available on terms to be discussed with the Israeli Government, and that the
                        matter of spares will also be discussed.</p>

                        approaches made by the Department to <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> on
                        this subject should place the matters raised by <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> with you in their proper perspective. These
                        particular incidents simply reinforce some basic suppositions which I
                        believe that many of us have felt for a long time. I would hope that our
                        discussions with <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> would therefore
                        concentrate primarily on the basics to the end that a more acceptable method

                    <p>In the Near East <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
                        <hi rend="italic">is happiest and most productive in those situations where
                            it has been welcomed by the local authorities and used by them as an
                            adjunct to its own internal security services</hi>. [<hi rend="italic">2
                            lines of source text not declassified</hi>] These close relations
                        naturally create an instinctive warm glow between the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> and these particular countries. While this
                        in itself is not reprehensible, I do believe that it colors the attitudes of
                        the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
                        <pb n="777" xml:id="pg_777" facs="0809"/>and contributes to a readiness
                        there to divide the Near East into “the good guys” and “the bad guys”. I
                        think that this factor should be constantly borne in mind both by the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> leadership and our own policymakers on the
                        seventh floor and in the White House. At issue is the question as to whether
                        the US can in fact accept the proposition that some at least of the Near
                        East states are fully sovereign, are jealous of their sovereignty and are
                        legitimately entitled to that jealousy. There should also be recognition
                        that <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> in the 50's had and then lost [<hi rend="italic">1 line of source text not declassified</hi>]. That there
                        should be feelings of nostalgia for this among the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> leadership is probably also natural but such feelings
                        should not be allowed to color judgments.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, at least in the Near East, <hi rend="italic">has yet to prove that it can operate usefully and
                            effectively in a sophisticated and/or hostile environment</hi>. Since
                        the loss of its [<hi rend="italic">2 lines of source text not
                            declassified</hi>] the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> has been able
                        to produce very little by way of useful intelligence [<hi rend="italic">less
                            than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. This little has been produced at
                        considerable risk to our relations and presumably considerable cost to the
                        taxpayer. At the same time intelligence targets in the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> are probably increasing in number. We may
                        have come to the point where the experts should make a basic re-examination
                        of targets in the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and methods of
                        achieving them. Hide-bound attitudes as to methods plus the nostalgic
                        hostility towards the <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> regime
                        mentioned above can only give us more trouble in Egypt.</p>
                    <p>[<hi rend="italic">5–1/2 lines of source text not declassified</hi>] The only
                        safe assumption is that the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> is probably
                        aware of most, if not all, of our intelligence operations in Egypt or with
                        Egyptians in other countries. From this assumption flow two rather important
                        considerations:</p>
                    <p>1) We are constantly at risk that the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                        will blow an operation at a time and in circumstances of its own
                        choosing,</p>
                    <p>2) That Egyptian informants are being coached to tell us what the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> wants us to hear. This must be kept in mind
                        in evaluating the product of such informants.</p>

                            from Amman, March 19, commented on a telegram from the Defense Attache
                            Office in Tel Aviv (not found) transmitting a message from <persName corresp="#p_RY1">Rabin</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_KGA2">Khammash</persName>. The telegram expressed concern about the
                            possibility of another Israeli attack on Jordan and recommended warning
                            the Israelis against the possible “catastrophic consequences” of such an
                            attack. Noting that the Jordanians had rejected any direct contact with
                            Israel in the wake of the Samu raid, it recommended that if the Israelis
                            had information for the Jordanians, they should forward it to the
                            Embassy in Amman, which would pass it to the appropriate authorities.
                            (Ibid.) Telegram 2567 from Amman, March 19, reported that <persName corresp="#p_KGA2">Khammash</persName> confirmed that it was still
                            Jordan's policy to take all possible action to prevent infiltration into

                        raid against Jordan which we firmly believe could have catastrophic

                        emphasizing that US interests in Middle East great and preservation those
                        interests depended in part on US relations <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. During periods those relations good US interests better
                        protected than in periods strain between two countries.</p>
                    <p>Non-alignment basic to <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> policy and without

                        Soviets attach Middle East.</p>
                    <p>Over recent years basic US presence has been PL 480 wheat. <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> now under specific instructions not
                        ask for wheat although purely personally he recognizes wheat has been major
                        counter Soviet influence.</p>
                    <p>While wheat arrangements between us now discontinued must make major and
                        speedy effort find way restore relations between us. Situation now highly
                        delicate but not impossible overcome.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> recommended we search for new
                        avenues cooperation but was not specific in suggestions. Urged we take new
                        look at Yemen and as he had suggested many times before recommended offer US
                        good offices to bring about solution this difficult problem. <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> does not wish overthrow <persName corresp="#p_FAAAS1">Faisal</persName> and has no desire harm US interest

                        appears desire prolong Yemen conflict to bring about US–<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> military confrontation which would be very
                        difficult situation for both countries. Essential US overcome belief in
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> that US does not want conflict to
                        end and condones <persName corresp="#p_FAAAS1">Faisal</persName>'s actions.
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BLD2">Battle</persName> recalled suggestion
                        he made President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> during their
                        last meeting re possible US willingness help pave way solution. Neither
                        President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> nor Vice Presidents
                            <persName corresp="#p_AFMAH1">Amer</persName> and Sadat to whom similar
                        suggestion advanced appeared encourage possibility. <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> responded by urging US make another
                        effort this direction.</p>
                    <pb n="781" xml:id="pg_781" facs="0813"/>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> then reviewed importance Western
                        position <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and expressed concern
                        difficulties with US increased as result absence relations with <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>. He urged US encourage <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> take initial step to bring about resumption relations, since
                            <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> larger power and must not be reluctant
                        make first move.</p>
                    <p>In summary Kamel urged early action by US find modus vivendi, based on
                        continuation icebox policy re Israel and effort restore waning confidence
                        between US–<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. He emphasized again
                        situation sensitive but controllable.</p>
                    <p>Secretary in responding expressed concern difficulty US had to get across
                        fact to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> that US wants good
                        relations <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. Expressed concern that
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> has concluded for reasons
                        not clear to us that US wishes ill to <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                        regime. This not the case with President Kennedy, President Johnson nor
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>. Suspicions erode
                        confidence and undoubtedly affect willingness <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> listen to us in our statements desire maintain good
                        relations. Secretary agreed Israeli problem probably manageable and domestic
                        pressures not as important an influence politically as some Arab observers
                        believe and not of nature to eliminate chance good relations.</p>
                    <p>Secretary then mentioned Arab neighbors afraid of <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> has created
                        impressions that have led to fear of his intentions. Leadership cannot be
                        demanded, it must be granted. If <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> wished
                        to lead Arabs and Arabs willing to be led US would have no objection but
                        this would be different situation from insistence and coercion. We would
                        hope Nasser could find way to reassure Arabs including King <persName corresp="#p_FAAAS1">Faisal</persName> of peaceful intentions in manner
                        which would remove attitudes of fear.</p>
                    <p>One effect of level of arms Russia has put into <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> is to upset equilibrium and raise concerns other countries.
                        Imperative some effort be made settle arms race. Once in past Secretary had
                        asked Gromyko whether Russia willing assist in limiting arms race. Gromyko
                        had replied affirmatively with respect nuclear arms but negatively with
                        respect conventional arms. Therefore must conclude <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> considers present policy advantageous to Russian interest
                        particularly when Russians make public reference to special friendships with
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, Algeria and Syria.</p>
                    <p>Another point of difficulty is that Nasser has never fully understood
                        problems inherent in dealing with giant democracy and all its complexities.
                        What is said can make tremendous difference in attitudes and speech such as
                        that on February 22 can cause great harm. This particular speech came at
                        moment of consultation Congressional leaders re new PL 480 agreement. While
                        US does not need flattery or cajoling silence itself might be great
                        contribution.</p>
                    <p>One channel we must look to in period strain is private field. Business ties
                        and private investment to extent <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> wishes
                        permit can help improve political relations.</p>
                    <pb n="782" xml:id="pg_782" facs="0814"/>
                    <p>Secretary agreed consider various points made by Ambassador and expressed
                        appreciation his efforts over past years improve relations between US–<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>.</p>

                    <p>In considering our <hi rend="italic">policy on the supply of arms to the Near

                        <hi rend="italic">Recalled</hi> our hope that a plateau in Near East arms
                        supply had been reached about a year ago after we had concluded arms sales
                        to certain Near East countries, and our hope that a sustained pause in the
                        further supply of arms to the area could be maintained; noted that meanwhile
                        the Soviet Union had continued to ship arms to certain countries in the Near

                        the Near East had been negative; and agreed that the Soviet Union probably
                        continued to see advantages in its military relationship with certain Near
                        East countries, and that there was no evidence that the Soviet Union would
                        be interested at this time in an understanding with Western suppliers on

                        not only the Arab-Israeli confrontation but also the relations between the
                        so-called “progressive” Arab states (e.g., <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, Syria, Iraq) and the more traditional Arab states (e.g.,
                        Saudi Arabia, Jordan), as well as the prospects for internal stability in
                        certain of the Arab countries which are friendly to us (e.g., Jordan,
                        Lebanon); noted that urgent considerations arising out of the Israeli attack
                        on Samu in November 1966 had most recently caused us to agree to provide
                        certain additional military equipment to Jordan; noted also that there is a
                        direct relationship between our policy on arms for the Arab states and
                        Israel and <pb n="783" xml:id="pg_783" facs="0815"/>our policy on arms for
                        Iran, given the Shah's concern over the threat he sees from <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>; and noted finally that, when it is
                        consistent with our broad foreign policy objectives, we have a
                        balance-of-payments interest in selling arms to certain buyers.</p>
                    <p>Agreed that our interests would be best served by the maintenance of only
                        such military forces and capabilities in the area as would deter the
                        outbreak of hostilities between the Arab states and Israel, and/or among the
                        Arab states themselves. The Group agreed that a drastic reduction—if not a
                        complete moratorium—on imports of arms into the area would be desirable, not
                        only to help maintain peace but also to permit countries in the region to
                        devote maximum resources to internal economic and social development; and
                        agreed that it remains particularly important to avoid the introduction into
                        the area of sophisticated new types of weapons systems, including nuclear
                        weapons. The Group agreed, furthermore, that Soviet cooperation is essential
                        for effective arms control in the Near East and that we should continue to
                        explore on all appropriate occasions the possibilities of an understanding
                        with the Soviet Union on this subject; and that an effective understanding
                        would also require the cooperation of various other European countries
                        (e.g., the United Kingdom, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, and
                        Italy, as well as Czechoslovakia).</p>
                    <p>The Group agreed that, while working toward our long-run objective of
                        effective arms control for the area, we should continue to exercise maximum
                        restraint in supplying arms to countries in the Near East. Given our current
                        lack of control over other external sources of arms for the area, we must
                        retain the flexibility to supply arms selectively so as to help maintain an
                        equilibrium that may deter an outbreak of hostilities. As regards the
                        Arab-Israeli confrontation, despite Soviet shipments to the Arabs we should
                        avoid becoming involved as the major supplier of arms to Israel and should
                        encourage the Government of Israel to look generally to Western European
                        suppliers for arms needed to maintain an effective defense against Arab
                        forces. The Group also agreed that, within a general policy of maximum
                        restraint, it may also continue to be desirable for us to supply limited
                        quantities and types of arms to help friendly countries in the area to
                        maintain internal security and political stability; but that the supply of
                        arms in such cases should be decided upon only with full consideration of
                        the aim to avoid an escalation of the arms race and to maintain peace in the
                        area.</p>

                    <p>In considering the pending request of the Government of Israel for (1) the
                        grant of 200 armored personnel carriers (<gloss target="#t_APC1">APC</gloss>'s—Model M–113 A1) valued at approximately $7.4 million, (2) the
                        grant of tank parts valued at $2 million, and (3) the supply on soft
                        concessional <pb n="784" xml:id="pg_784" facs="0816"/>credit terms of
                        follow-on Hawk missile spares and M–48 tank parts valued at $14 million, the
                        Group:</p>
                    <p>Agreed that Israel does not have a valid military requirement at this time
                        for the APC's; that, in any event, the recency of Israel's attack on Samu
                        (Jordan) made it undesirable for us to accede at this time to the supply of
                        new weapons; that the supply of improved new <gloss target="#t_APC1">APC</gloss>'s of the M–113 A1 type would tend to escalate the Near East
                        arms race; and that if Israel were adamant about obtaining new <gloss target="#t_APC1">APC</gloss>'s, our own interests dictated that the
                        United States should not be directly involved.</p>
                    <p>Reaffirmed that we should maintain our established policy against supplying
                        grant military aid to Israel and that we should reject the Government of
                        Israel's request of grant aid for <gloss target="#t_APC1">APC</gloss>'s and
                        tank parts. The Group agreed, furthermore, that we should refuse to sell
                        Israel the M–113 A1's or to agree to the sale of the similar U.S.-licensed,
                        Italian-made Model M–113, for either credit or cash; and should the
                        Government of Israel ask to purchase our <gloss target="#t_APC1">APC</gloss>'s, we should encourage it to look to other sources in Western
                        Europe for equipment.</p>
                    <p>The Group also reaffirmed its view that it would set an undesirable precedent
                        to provide credit for Israel for the purchase of follow-on military spares
                        and parts. The Group agreed, however, that if it should be determined that
                        some concession on military supply should be made to Israel, a credit in the
                        range of $7–10 million might be offered at the current going rate (5 1/2%
                        interest, 7 years, 10% down payment) for the purchase of spares and
                        parts.</p>

                        Group:</p>
                    <p>Noted that a Lebanese request for tanks had been made more than a year ago;
                        that we had recently made Lebanon an offer, pursuant to a long-standing
                        request, to supply two Hawk missile batteries on concessional credit terms,
                        and that our offer was now before the Government of Lebanon for decision;
                        and that the prospects of funds for additional military purchases by Lebanon
                        have been adversely affected by Lebanon's commitment to purchase fighter
                        aircraft from France, the probability that no further funds will be
                        available from the United Arab Command, and conflicting budget demands in
                        Lebanon. The Group also noted the importance attached by the Government of
                        Lebanon to the purchase of tanks, the importance of continued support by the
                        Lebanese armed forces to the stability of the moderate government of
                        President <persName corresp="#p_HC7">Helou</persName>, the fact that we have
                        not supplied any military <pb n="785" xml:id="pg_785" facs="0817"/>equipment—apart from a few recoilless rifles—to Lebanon for several years,
                        and the desirability of maintaining some U.S. military tie to Lebanon.</p>
                    <p>The Group agreed that, because of the various factors noted above and because
                        of the relatively small size of the proposal in question, that our agreement
                        to supply a limited number of M–48 tanks to Lebanon would not be
                        inconsistent with our broader policy on the supply of arms to the Near East
                        and would not constitute a major factor in accelerating the arms race; and
                        agreed that we could now offer to sell up to 35 M–48 tanks to Lebanon,
                        together with necessary support spares and basic load ammunition. Lead time
                        on delivery of the tanks is estimated at 24 months, and the estimated cost
                        of the entire package is $4.25 million. The Group agreed that no further
                        financial accommodation should be offered to Lebanon beyond the amount of
                        concessional credit already contemplated for the supply of Hawks, and that
                        the burden of any decision on procurement as between Hawks and tanks should
                        be left to the Government of Lebanon; if part of the contemplated credit is
                        not used for the Hawks, it could be applied to the sale of tanks.</p>

                            summarized here is attached.</note> It doesn't give the Israelis
                        everything they asked for and runs lower than last year. However, on all but
                        one item, I think they'd have to admit we've been as responsive as possible
                        given our limitations.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> recommends about $48
                        million (Israel's requests total $76 million). We've tried to be as generous
                        as possible in balance of payments type aid because <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> faces unemployment after deliberately
                        slowing economic growth to shake out uncompetitive industry, narrow Israel's
                        trade imbalance and get ready for association with the Common Market. The
                        package includes:</p>
                    <p>—$23.5 million in PL 480 (feedgrains, oil, maybe tobacco, no wheat).
                        Agriculture is thinking of 75% dollar sale. Last year dollar sale was only
                        25%. I'd go only to 50% this year.</p>
                    <p>—$9 million in credit for tank and Hawk missile spares. Defense opposes
                        credit for normal maintenance items, but would make an exception to beef up
                        the package. I recommend this inconspicuous military help.</p>
                    <p>—$5 million in covert aid for Israel's anti-Communist African programs. This
                        is a private request from <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> to
                        help with his budget and doubles last year's program. [<hi rend="italic">2

                    </p>
                    <p>—About $10 million in Ex-Im loans. We can't assign an exact price tag yet
                        because we don't have details on the project. But we'd invite the Israelis
                        to submit a fertilizer project to Ex-Im instead of to AID.<note n="4" xml:id="d401fn4">A handwritten note, apparently in Johnson's hand,

                    <p>—We'd offer to accept Israeli bids on AID off-shore procurement for 12
                        months. Though the price tag is relatively small, this is important in
                        helping put unemployed Israelis to work. Defense is also increasing
                        procurement in Israel. <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>'s
                        Finance Minister has made a strong pitch for this.</p>
                    <p>—We'd give the Israelis Hawk missile capability to do all their own
                        maintenance. This costs us nothing but cuts them in on some classified
                        data.</p>
                    <p>The attached charts shows where this would put us in relation to past years.
                        Since last year's plane sale was unusually high, I think we can justify this
                            <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1967 level. We still have the
                        desalting project to talk out, and to emphasize that I recommend we move
                        quickly in naming Bunker's successor.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> recommends we turn them
                        down on two items:</p>
                    <p>—They asked for $20 million in Development Loans on top of the $6 million you
                        authorized last fall from an old loan. Israel is doing so well that it ought
                        to be using Ex-Im rather than the softer AID loans. Congress is grumbling
                        about adding Israel to the list when it's trying to limit the number of
                        countries receiving aid. Last year we split their request of $20 million and
                        offered $10 million each from AID and Ex-Im. I think this is the year to get
                        out of AID lending and refer them entirely to Ex-Im. They'll gripe, but this
                        is reasonable.</p>
                    <p>—Far tougher to turn down is their request for 200 Armed Personnel Carriers
                        ($7.4 million). <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> tells us
                        informally that <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> is personally
                        interested and that a turndown will trigger a violent reaction from
                        Jerusalem—and by implication from Israel's friends here.</p>
                    <p>I agree with State and Defense that we can't give these via grant. A grant
                        would amount to starting a Military Assistance Program in Israel, since all
                        previous deals have been credit or commercial sales. This would be a major
                        change in our policy not to be a major arms supplier in the Middle East.</p>
                    <p>The real issue is whether to offer a credit sale instead. We understand
                        informally they'd settle for that. <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> earlier recommended that we sell 100. Now he
                        agrees with Defense to recommend against supplying <gloss target="#t_APC1">APC</gloss>'s on any terms. The argument:</p>
                    <p>—We ought to keep the brakes on the Middle East arms race. When we completed
                        the Israeli aircraft deal in March 1965, we told <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> that sale completed a round of escalation. We said we
                        didn't foresee further sales soon unless the Soviets made more. As far as we
                        know, they haven't, and our December sale to Jordan was too small to affect
                        the balance.</p>
                    <p>—We don't want to become Israel's sole military supplier, but Israel is
                        trying to maneuver us into that position. In our aircraft deal, <pb n="788" xml:id="pg_788" facs="0820"/>we made them agree they'd continue to look
                        to Europe for most of their equipment. Good <gloss target="#t_APC1">APC</gloss>'s—unlike the aircraft—are available in Europe at reasonable
                        prices. Israel has 1,000 old ones, and selling even 100 opens the door to
                        our modernizing the whole line.</p>
                    <p>—We should be tough as long as they play coy on their nuclear position.
                            <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> has invited our technicians
                        to visit Dimona on 22 April.<note n="5" xml:id="d401fn5">Telegram 3020 from

                        last visit. Only when they report will we know whether we should use all our
                        leverage to make them agree to visits every six months.</p>
                    <p>—We don't think Israel needs <gloss target="#t_APC1">APC</gloss>'s urgently.
                        The 1,000 in operation are World War II vintage and will have to be replaced
                        in five years or so. But the Israelis do a remarkable job of keeping
                        equipment running, and the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> feels that
                        immediate modernization is not essential.</p>
                    <p>—We shouldn't compensate the Israelis for our Jordan package since that
                        resulted directly from their attack. They won't take seriously our counsel
                        of restraint if we reward them now.</p>
                    <p>The strongest argument for a turndown in my book is trying to get a grip on
                        the Middle East arms race. The only approach that could work is an
                        understanding with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to stop big
                        shipments. We've probed before, and the Soviets have shown little interest.
                        But in the context of persuading the Israelis to sign the Non-Proliferation
                        Treaty, they might show more. This is a long shot. But if you decide you can
                        stand the heat, a pause in sales might be worth a try. We could stand up to
                        Israel's friends confident that we're not just stalling. If by fall, the
                            <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> has come to naught, then we'd
                        reconsider.</p>
                    <p>I've double-checked with <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>,
                        and he doesn't feel we'd be reneging on a commitment to refuse the <gloss target="#t_APC1">APC</gloss>'s. Even so, if you approve a turndown, the
                        way we couch our answer will be important. The spirit of our response should
                        be more “not now” than a flat “no.”</p>
                    <p>My suggestion is to have <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>
                        give them our answer. I can background Abe Feinberg, but the official
                        request came through <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>, and
                        I think we ought to try building him as our sympathetic but firm spokesman
                        to the Israelis. The key problem in US-Israeli relations is that the
                        Israelis like to think they have a special relationship with us, while the
                        State and Defense professionals treat them and the Arabs with the same cool
                        even-handedness. <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>
                        <pb n="789" xml:id="pg_789" facs="0821"/>should be warmer and more candid,

                        to President tonight:</p>
                    <p>“A major border clash centering in and around the Southern and Central
                        Demilitarized Zones took place today. The trouble apparently began when an
                        Israeli tractor plowing in the DZ near Haon was fired upon by Syrians. The
                        resulting battle lasted most of the day and involved mortar, artillery and
                        tank fire and several aerial dogfights. Israel claims to have downed seven
                        Syrian MIG–21 aircraft without loss to its own air arm, and claims to have
                        damaged several Syrian ground positions that had fired on Israeli
                        cultivators and settlements. Syria also claims a victory, alleging that five
                        Israeli aircraft were shot down and at least 70 Israelis killed in fighting
                        that came about when Israel ‘insisted on aggression.’ Syria admits losing
                        four MIGs and suffering 5 deaths.</p>
                    <p>“There are no reports yet from <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> truce
                        observers. We have no basis for assessing Israel's claim that the plowing
                        that touched off the <pb n="790" xml:id="pg_790" facs="0822"/>day's events
                        was being done in a field that had been under regular cultivation by Israel
                        for years. With both sides claiming victory, there is a fairly good chance
                        that fighting will not be resumed tomorrow.”</p>
                    <p>2. Department taking following line with press on “if asked” basis:</p>
                    <p>“We regret the hostilities and loss of life involved. We are continuing to
                        study the situation and will be interested particularly in reports that come

                        meetings. This move particularly welcome in view renewed shooting southern
                        DZ this morning and military preparations apparently being made by both

                        Although Syrians may have been bloodied on April 7, it seems unlikely they
                        will desist from further responses to Israeli plowing. This threatens in

                    <p>B. Rivalries and disputes among the Arabs reduce their chances of doing
                        anything significant about their quarrel with Israel; these rivalries also
                        create some danger of precipitating crises from which large-scale
                        Arab-Israeli hostilities could develop.</p>
                    <p>C. The Israelis seem likely to continue existing policies, including
                        occasional retaliatory action; they would resort to force on a large scale
                        only if they felt their security seriously endangered.</p>
                    <pb n="792" xml:id="pg_792" facs="0824"/>
                    <p>D. The Soviet leaders almost certainly view the Arab-Israeli dispute as
                        promoting their interests. But they do not wish to see it develop into armed
                        conflict. While continuing to supply arms to their Arab friends, they
                        probably wish to keep the arms race from getting out of hand.</p>
                    <p>E. If and when the Arabs come to believe that the Israelis are at the point
                        of deploying strategic missiles,<note n="2" xml:id="d404fn2">In the context
                            of an Arab-Israeli conflict, strategic missiles would be those capable
                            of striking the major population centers or military installations of
                            the enemy, i.e., missiles with a range roughly between 100 and 500
                            miles. [Footnote in the source text.]</note> a phase of sharply
                        increased Arab-Israeli tensions will probably arise. This is likely to occur
                        within the next two to three years. In this event, the Egyptians would
                        probably press the Soviets for help.</p>
                    <p>F. To such an appeal the Soviet leaders would probably feel that they had to
                        respond in some way. They would probably pledge to help Egypt or other Arab
                        states if attacked and would probably provide token technical aid on the
                        Egyptian missile program. They might go so far as to provide a missile
                        system, but we believe they would not supply nuclear warheads or assist in
                        the development of a nuclear weapons program.</p>
                    <p>G. Although periods of increased tension in the Arab-Israeli dispute will
                        occur from time to time, both sides appear to appreciate that large-scale
                        military action involves considerable risk and no assurance of leading to a
                        solution. In any event, the chances are good that the threat of great power
                        intervention will prevent an attempt by either side to resolve the problem
                        by military force.</p>

                    <p>I believe you are familiar with the recommendation of the Interdepartmental
                        Regional Group for Near East-South Asia (<gloss target="#t_IRG1">IRG</gloss>/NESA) that <pb n="793" xml:id="pg_793" facs="0825"/>we should
                        not accede to Israel's request for 200 armored personnel carriers (<gloss target="#t_APC1">APC</gloss>s), on either a grant aid or sales
                            basis.<note n="2" xml:id="d405fn2">See <ref target="#d400">Document
                                400</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>I personally support that recommendation, and believe it would be a serious
                        mistake for us to provide <gloss target="#t_APC1">APC</gloss>s to Israel at
                        this time, either 200 or any lesser number. I recognize our interest in the
                        maintenance by Israel of an adequate deterrent against attack by any of its
                        Arab neighbors, but the present and prospective military balance in the
                        Middle East strongly favors Israel. The Joint Chiefs of Staff have recently
                        confirmed their view that Israel will be militarily unchallengeable by any
                        combination of Arab states at least during the next five years.<note n="3" xml:id="d405fn3">See <ref target="#d387">Document 387</ref>.</note> As
                        presently trained and equipped, the armed forces of Israel are greatly
                        superior in effectiveness and firepower to those of their potential
                        opponents, individually or collectively.</p>
                    <p>Israeli security is also strengthened by the US policy of maintaining a
                        controlled military supply relationship with those Arab states who show
                        moderation toward Israel and who resist opportunities to acquire Soviet
                        equipment; this helps to avoid a polarization of the Arab-Israeli dispute
                        along East-West lines. Our dramatic airlift of equipment to Jordan last
                        winter was necessary to save King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>'s regime, which had been badly undermined by the
                        unfortunate Israeli raid against Samu in November. Our failure to act could
                        have led to a rapid deterioration in Jordan, involving the introduction of
                        Egyptian armed forces and Soviet advisers and equipment. Provision of
                        additional <gloss target="#t_APC1">APC</gloss>s to Israel at this time
                        could, in my judgment, only serve to undercut the good effect of what we did
                        for Jordan, to “pay twice” for the Israeli miscalculation at Samu, and to
                        agitate a situation that is now relatively quiescent.</p>
                    <p>In the agreement of March 1966 for the purchase of Skyhawk aircraft,<note n="4" xml:id="d405fn4">See <ref target="#d283">Document
                            283</ref>.</note> Israel explicitly recognized that that sale did not
                        constitute a precedent for future U.S. action, and further agreed “to
                        continue to look to Europe for the bulk of its military requirements and not
                        to regard the U.S. as a major arms supplier.” In making its current request
                        for <gloss target="#t_APC1">APC</gloss>s, the Israelis would appear to be
                        disregarding these conditions which they accepted just over a year ago. In
                        my judgment, our recent supplementary aid to Jordan has not altered the
                        validity of these conditions.</p>
                    <p>I therefore recommend that we turn down the Israeli request for <gloss target="#t_APC1">APC</gloss>s, and suggest that they should look to
                        Western European sources if they consider it necessary to purchase <gloss target="#t_APC1">APC</gloss>s at this time.</p>

                        until after 28 April when we'll have a report on this weekend's inspection

                        recommend against. Their arguments boil down to:</p>
                    <p>A. Uneasiness about fueling any arms race. Congress is concerned. Our
                        India-Pak decision tried to restrain that buildup, and we've kept our Middle
                        East programs to the minimum. <gloss target="#t_APC1">APC</gloss>'s would
                        not seriously affect the arms balance, but no one wants to start another
                        round of sales. In the context of the Non-Proliferation talks, we may even
                        try for tacit Soviet agreement to hold down arms shipments to the Middle
                        East. This sale wouldn't upset that effort, but our skirts would be cleaner
                        without it.</p>
                    <p>B. Concern over too close a military relationship while Israel's nuclear
                        intentions are in doubt. Our intelligence people suspect—on uncertain
                        evidence—that Israel may be building a separation plant. Our inspection team
                        will visit Dimona this weekend for the first time in over a year. With the
                            <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> ahead of us, we may need a clear
                        expression of Israel's position. We can't bargain with <gloss target="#t_APC1">APC</gloss>'s, but we could hold them until we're sure
                        our inspection team gets full cooperation.</p>
                    <p>Our dilemma is that foreign policy interests argue against a sale now, but
                        the Israelis will treat a “no” as a broken promise. Israel could <pb n="795" xml:id="pg_795" facs="0827"/>do without <gloss target="#t_APC1">APC</gloss>'s this year, but <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> believes that we promised something in return for
                        their keeping quiet on our Jordan package last December.</p>
                    <p>If we go ahead, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>
                        recommends we minimize repercussions by selling only 100. He suggests
                        stretching delivery through 1970, but after our airlift to Jordan, I'm
                        afraid that won't work. In any case, we must control publicity and timing.
                        Defense tentatively concludes that Israel could set up an assembly line
                        using some US-supplied parts, but Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> believes this would make our relationship too
                        close.</p>
                    <p>You may want to hear argument before deciding. On foreign policy grounds
                        alone, I would recommend telling the Israelis we can't sell <gloss target="#t_APC1">APC</gloss>'s now, but would reconsider next year. But
                        if you want to go ahead, I recommend 75–100 now and promising to discuss
                        assembly in Israel.</p>

                        for a scenario<note n="6" xml:id="d406fn6">The first option is revised in
                            Johnson's handwriting to read: “Hold APC's and package until after 28

                    <p>I'm willing to say “not now”</p>
                    <p>II. <hi rend="italic">Amount and terms of PL 480</hi>. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> recommended $23.5 million
                        because Agriculture judged that Israel will need less than it asked for.
                        Your figure was $28 million—the full Israeli request. One way to avoid
                        rushing more scarce grain than needed would be to negotiate $23.5 million
                        now but say we'll go up to $28 million if Israel needs more.</p>
                    <p>In view of Congressional pressure to tighten terms, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> recommended 75% dollar sale at
                        about 4.5% interest (last year 25% at 2.5%). Normally, we would figure on
                        moving to 50% dollar sale at maybe 3.5% as an appropriate transitional step.
                        You initially preferred last year's terms, but you may want to consider
                        slight hardening this year to put us on a better footing with Congress.</p>

                    <p>I have sent you a separate memo on the Israeli aid package.<note n="3" xml:id="d407fn3">
                            <ref target="#d406">Document 406</ref>.</note> I recommend you not give
                        Abe any answers until you have discussed this with Secretaries <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>. Your options on timing are:</p>
                    <p>1. Hold the whole package until after we get the report on our Dimona
                        inspection about 28 April.</p>
                    <p>2. Release everything in the package except your decision on <gloss target="#t_APC1">APC</gloss>'s until we're sure the Israelis have
                        cooperated fully with our inspection team.</p>
                    <p>3. Release the whole package now.</p>
                    <p>The main reason for holding off is to demonstrate that you're serious about
                        nuclear non-proliferation. Even this year's whole aid package wouldn't be
                        enough to bargain with on this life-or-death issue <pb n="797" xml:id="pg_797" facs="0829"/>(as Israel sees it). However, as we
                        approach the time when we may need to press Israel to sign the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>, we must consider how much leverage we need
                        to hold in reserve. So far the Israelis have succeeded in keeping this apart
                        from the rest of our relationship.</p>
                    <p>The only counter big enough to sway <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>, I suspect, will be the US-Israeli relationship
                        itself. By purely foreign policy standards, we should be drawing back a
                        little now to signal how seriously we take this issue. I realize this
                        creates a domestic dilemma, but I should think the Jewish community itself
                        with its liberal tendencies would be strongly attracted to the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Israel has never leveled with us on its nuclear intent. Our intelligence
                        people have scattered—but as yet unconfirmed—evidence that Israel is quietly
                        but steadily placing itself in a position to produce nuclear weapons on
                        short notice. We also know that Israel is investing large sums in a French
                        built surface-to-surface missile designed to carry a nuclear warhead. I must
                        emphasize that we do not know exactly what Israel is doing or what its
                        position on the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> will be. But we know
                        enough to be seriously concerned. Therefore, it may be wise to take special
                        care with each step this year.</p>

                    <p>Washington, April 20, 1967, 10:10 a.m.</p>
                    <p>Mr. President:</p>
                    <p> Hal Saunders and I have staffed out the paper done by Dave Ginsburg.<note n="5" xml:id="d407fn5">Reference is evidently to an unsigned and undated
                            memorandum for the President on the subject “1968—American Jewry and
                            Israel,” attached but not printed.</note> I wanted you to have, as he
                        did them during the night, Hal's direct comments on the paper<note n="6" xml:id="d407fn6">An April 20 memorandum from
                                <persName>Saunders</persName> to <persName>Rostow</persName> with
                            his comments is attached but not printed.</note>—including their flavor.
                        Hal is an extremely well-balanced analyst of the Middle East.</p>
                    <p>I would divide my own comments in two parts: first, the items in David's
                        paper which we had planned already to support or could support; second, our
                        security relations with Israel.</p>
                    <p>1. This is the position with respect to David's non-military proposals:</p>
                    <p>—Food purchases: already provided for.</p>
                    <pb n="798" xml:id="pg_798" facs="0830"/>
                    <p>—Development loans: EX–IM is the proper source, given Israel's level of
                        income and foreign exchange position; but there is no reason why Linder
                        cannot be very generous.</p>
                    <p>—Stimulating Israeli fertilizer exports: provided for in our package.</p>
                    <p>—Repayment in commodities: a new proposal now being staffed out. It seems
                        possible to me, especially if Israel would make the deal proposed by David
                        in the first part of paragraph 16 (p. 17).<note n="7" xml:id="d407fn7">The
                            proposal was for Israel to retain from $150 to $250 million of its
                            foreign exchange reserves in the United States in order to ease the U.S.
                            balance-of-payments difficulties.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>—Exports to the U.S.: <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> is pressing this as
                        hard as it can; perhaps Bob McNamara could press it a little harder.</p>
                    <p>—Desalinization: This should go forward urgently: <persName corresp="#p_VJJ1">Jack Valenti</persName> would be fine but, as with Eric Johnston, he
                        might need to put himself in the position to approach the Arabs with some
                        kind of parallel project in order not to damage his moving picture interests
                        in the Middle East. Such an approach was not ruled out in the Bunker terms
                        of reference; but it may be more important for <persName corresp="#p_VJJ1">Jack</persName> than for Ellsworth. <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> proposes Bowie; but Dillon and others are
                        possibilities.</p>
                    <p>—An American University in Israel: Without intimate knowledge, Hal's marginal
                        comment on page 15 seems wise; namely, that it is unlikely we could create a
                        new institution up to high existing Israeli standards; but we might increase
                        our already substantial support for Israeli institutions now in being.
                        Nevertheless, an “American University” in Israel might be looked at
                        afresh.</p>
                    <p>—Visits to Israel by high-level U.S. officials and a visit to the U.S. by
                            <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> seem manageable.</p>
                    <p>2. Security problems.</p>
                    <p>a. In general David's paper does not recognize something which the Israeli
                        government does recognize even if sometimes reluctantly; namely, the U.S.
                        has legitimate interests throughout the Middle East and the maintenance of
                        those interests is, by and large, in the long-run interest of Israel,
                        because, where our influence is strong, we strengthen the hand of Arab
                        moderates. It is odd that as thoughtful a man as David should not have made
                        this point.</p>
                    <p>b. Our critical problem with Israel is that they have wanted the advantage of
                        a U.S. guarantee but have simultaneously wanted to maintain a military
                        establishment which could be effective if the U.S. guarantee did not operate
                        in a crisis. The technical reason for the Israel position is their anxiety
                        about a quick Arab strike against them—from the air or on the ground—which
                        we might be too slow to deal with. It is this ambiguity which has, quite
                        understandably, in some ways led <pb n="799" xml:id="pg_799" facs="0831"/>them to build up their military establishment in ways which made it easier
                        for the Russians to have their offers of military aid accepted in the Middle
                        East. The <gloss target="#t_APC1">APC</gloss> question relates to this. Bob
                        McNamara and others think that <gloss target="#t_APC1">APC</gloss> purchases
                        from the U.S. might open up another round of Soviet military credit sales to
                        the Arabs in the Middle East. I am not sure that is necessarily so if the
                            <gloss target="#t_APC1">APC</gloss>'s are moved in on a clear
                        replacement basis. There is another problem with certain members of Congress
                        who have resisted our being an active part of the Middle East arms race.</p>
                    <p>c. The nuclear question. This is critical for large U.S. interests. We have
                        been able to live with this ambiguous Israeli defense policy in terms of
                        conventional weapons. Should they wish to have both a national nuclear
                        capability and U.S. guarantees, we would be in an almost impossible
                        position. Moreover, if they insisted on it, it might well destroy the
                        possibilities of a non-proliferation treaty throughout the world. Therefore,
                        we must develop a much deeper understanding with them on the nuclear
                        question if we are to proceed with a policy of being, quite openly and
                        without apology, their friends.</p>

                    <p>9598. 1. Met with Pres <persName corresp="#p_HC7">Helou</persName> evening
                        April 18. His main themes were (A) deterioration in Lebanese political
                        stability, (B) necessity for <gloss target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss> commence
                        economic and social development program despite lack of funds, (C) massive
                        Soviet aid offer to Lebanon, and (D) urgent, almost desperate plea for US
                        assistance.</p>
                    <p>2. Soviet comprehensive assistance package is major new factor in equation.
                        Offer, which buttresses increased Soviet activity in Lebanon in other
                        fields, includes inter alia (A) Soviet purchase large amounts Lebanese
                        apples and citrus fruits in exchange for Lebanese agreement buy equivalent
                        value of commodities in <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> which now
                        being purchased in third countries. (B) Proposal to construct up to twenty
                        (presumably <pb n="800" xml:id="pg_800" facs="0832"/>consumer goods)
                        factories in Lebanese private sector with Soviets agreeing purchase total
                        production. (C) Financing and constructing the usual steel plant. (D)
                        Wide-ranging proposals to finance a variety of <gloss target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss> development projects, particularly in hydro and electricity
                        generating and distribution projects. (E) Financing and technical assistance
                        in road projects as well as a possible subway system. I feel sure offer also
                        included armament sales proposals although <persName corresp="#p_HC7">Helou</persName> skipped several sections in reading to me from very
                        detailed multi-page Soviet proposal.</p>
                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_HC7">Helou</persName> said he had been sitting on
                        Soviet proposal since March 13 and so far had avoided leaks. He was aware,
                        however, that he was sitting on a timebomb and that leftist groups in the
                        country would ultimately expose existence of Soviet offer in order present
                        maximum embarrassment to <gloss target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss>. Soviets would
                        also be putting on pressure, perhaps during upcoming visit of Soviet
                        Parliamentary delegation. Soviets had stressed in original presentation that
                        they now involved in large-scale aid to Iran and Turkey and had posed
                        specific question to Lebanon as to whether she intended to act more
                        pro-Western than the <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> powers. This
                        was important propaganda point in <persName corresp="#p_HC7">Helou</persName>'s mind. Also, he added, Damascus and Cairo would of
                        course join at appropriate time in applying pressure on Lebanon to accept
                        all or part of the Soviet offer, using their own experience as model.</p>
                    <p>4. Unfortunately, said <persName corresp="#p_HC7">Helou</persName>, he was
                        not immune to such pressures since he had been unable to make progress in
                        moving the <gloss target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss>'s essential economic and
                        social development schemes off dead center. Despite his determined efforts
                        reduce graft and pare budget, the problem was very simply one of lack of
                        ready funds and ultimately he could not resist attractive offers of external
                        assistance from any sources if there was no other way to respond to the
                        legitimate aspirations of his people. The leftist and radical political
                        forces and leaders within Lebanon were more than ready to take advantage of
                        the government's inability to act. Since they would be espousing legitimate
                        social causes and economic grievances this was not the kind of situation
                        which he could control by muzzling the press or calling in the security
                        forces to suppress leftist agitation. In any case, he also believed that
                        social progress was essential and he could only chide himself for not having
                        started sooner. (He did not take refuge in the genuine excuse that the Intra
                        Bank crisis was a major set-back to his plans.)</p>
                    <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_HC7">Helou</persName> emphasized that he was not
                        raising the bugaboo of Soviet assistance in Lebanon to apply leverage on the
                        US. But the simple fact was that he had to have untied credits of the kind
                        represented by US grain sales in order to give him a free hand in financing
                        the most urgent projects (e.g., housing, education, public health, roads)
                        without the further long delay which specific and detailed project planning
                        would <pb n="801" xml:id="pg_801" facs="0833"/>involve. Proposed credits
                        from international institutions or from such countries as Kuwait and France,
                        although available, required substantial down payments and too much time to
                        implement. He needed action now. In response to my many remonstrations on
                        the dangers of Soviet economic penetration and my comments on the lack of
                        comparability of Soviet proposals for Lebanon (which gave them strong
                        foothold in economic life of country) as contrasted to Iran (exploitation of
                        petroleum resources which had no other ready market), <persName corresp="#p_HC7">Helou</persName> simply responded that he fully agreed.
                        His main objective was to keep the Soviets out of Lebanon. The pitfalls he
                        clearly understood. What he needed was an alternative course of action which
                        would keep the opposition quiet.</p>
                    <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_HC7">Helou</persName> then made it clear, in a
                        somber and sometimes impassioned presentation, that his only source of help
                        was from the US. The psychological impact of US assistance was as important
                        as the financial. Without visible US support he could not stave off the
                        pent-up pressures for development and social progress which ultimately would
                        present the left with its golden political opportunity, and as well bring in
                        a Soviet presence. He painted a gloomy picture of the future, and said that
                        his successor would indeed have infinitely worse problems than he, unless
                        something were done quickly to stem the leftward drift of the country. The
                        socialist Arab states were of course already at work, nibbling away at
                        confidence in Lebanon's free enterprise system.</p>
                    <p>7. I took the opportunity to make the point that I had been disturbed about
                        the steady deterioration and leftward trend in Lebanon as represented by
                        such events as Lebanese sponsorship of Afro-Asian Writers Conference; the
                        apparent succumbing to outside pressures to make decisions that obviously
                        were not in Lebanese interest; and the inability of the <gloss target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss> to restrain propaganda attacks in the local
                        press in such obvious matters of self-interest as Sixth Fleet visits. I
                        noted with concern the growing permissiveness with regard to criticism and
                        attack against the US. Helou accepted the criticism and admitted that much
                        of it was apt. The real problem, he reiterated, was that the <gloss target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss> had been unable to start its development
                        programs. This had brought about a legitimate focus of unrest and loss of
                        confidence in the government which was seized upon by the radical political
                        elements. As he had reminded me many times before, he thought it was in the
                        self-interest of the US to help him create an environment which would
                        reverse this trend and make it possible for the <gloss target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss> not only to do that which needed doing to develop the
                        country, but also to emphasize the supporting role of the US. It was up to
                        the US, as the stronger partner, to take the initiative to create the
                        ambiance for closer cooperation between Lebanon and the US in all
                        fields.</p>

                    <p>8. During the course of the conversation I took the opportunity to describe
                        the US grain credit proposals, as set forth in State 173820.<note n="2" xml:id="d408fn2">Telegram 173820 to Beirut, April 12, instructed the

                        <persName corresp="#p_HC7">Helou</persName>, while unhappy with high cost

                        substantial interest in considering any US offer which was “acceptable” even
                        if not clearly “advantageous.” His problem was to get funds, and any funds
                        generated by our credits would be immediately channelled into development
                        projects. He said he would like as large a program as possible, if we could
                        come to agreement. I informed him that I had just discussed the matter with
                        FonMin Hakim and had given him latest information I had. We agreed I would
                        again see Hakim immediately in order to present to <gloss target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss> in clear terms the nature and conditions of the US

                    <p>9599. Subject: US Sixth Fleet.</p>
                    <p>1. During the course my discussion with President Charles <persName corresp="#p_HC7">Helou</persName> April 18, I raised issue of present
                        propaganda attacks levied upon Sixth Fleet and its presence in
                        Mediterranean. Referred to <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName>
                            statement<note n="2" xml:id="d409fn2">Reference is to a statement made
                            by <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> in an interview that
                            appeared in U.S. News and World Report. In response to a question
                            whether he would expect help from the United States if Israel were
                            attacked in force by its neighbors, he stated that Israel would rely
                            primarily on its own army but that he would expect help “especially if I
                            take into consideration all the solemn promises that have been made to
                            Israel. We get these promises when we ask the United States for arms and
                            are told: 'Don't spend your money. We are here. The Sixth Fleet is
                            here.' My reply to this advice is that the Sixth Fleet might not be
                            available fast enough for one reason or another, so Israel must be
                            strong on its own.” (U.S. News and World Report (Vol. LXII, No. 16),
                            April 17, 1967, p. 76)</note>

                        President as I did with Foreign Minister Hakim April 17 (see Embtel
                            9452).<note n="3" xml:id="d409fn3">Telegram 9452 from Beirut, April 17,

                            statement. <persName corresp="#p_PDJ1">Porter</persName> told him the
                            United States could not constantly engage in public debate over
                            statements by leaders of other states and assured him that U.S. policy
                            toward the Middle East as stated by President Kennedy and other leaders
                            had not changed. (National Archives and Records Administration, <gloss target="#t_RG1">RG</gloss> 59, Central Files 1967–69, DEF 7
                            LEB–US)</note> Reiterated that unauthorized statement by a leader of a
                        given state does not constitute United States policy. With due recognition
                        to existence free press in Lebanon, expressed distress over unbridled
                        propaganda attacks against United States and against Sixth Fleet visits
                        Lebanon by radical Lebanese papers and few Lebanese politicians.</p>
                    <p>2. Explained to <persName corresp="#p_HC7">Helou</persName> that purpose
                        Sixth Fleet in Med twofold: (1) oppose Communist aggression, (2) safeguard
                        peace in area. Pointed out raison d'etre Sixth Fleet had to be viewed in
                        this context. Fleet not here to protect any particular state, but to
                        forestall aggression.</p>
                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_HC7">Helou</persName> stated Lebanon played
                        instrumental role in Arab League in avoiding all criticism of presence
                        nuclear weapons in Mediterranean. <persName corresp="#p_HC7">Helou</persName> commented if he could “press a button” to stop attacks
                        of politicians and newspapers against US and Sixth Fleet he would do so
                        immediately. Stated “I am not King <persName corresp="#p_HIT1">Hussein</persName>, nor King Feisal, nor President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, I am the Chief of State of
                        Lebanon”. Referred to confessional nature Lebanon's society and stated he
                        obliged play much more delicate role in facing various propaganda attacks
                        which emanate from inside and outside of Lebanon. Said he had to take into
                        consideration views of various Lebanese confessional groups and commented
                        “half the population of Lebanon looks to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> and Atassi” for leadership. Said he must work within
                        these limitations.</p>
                    <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_HC7">Helou</persName> asserted US must recognize
                        Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KR6">Karame</persName>'s position.
                        Explained that <persName corresp="#p_KR6">Karame</persName>, as Sunni
                        leader, facing domestic political opposition which ready take advantage any
                        opportunity to bring pressure to bear against <persName corresp="#p_KR6">Karame</persName> government. <persName corresp="#p_HC7">Helou</persName> said if pressures emanating from Cairo and Damascus
                        added to local pressures <persName corresp="#p_KR6">Karame</persName> faces,
                            <persName corresp="#p_KR6">Karame</persName> would find himself in most
                        difficult situation in maintaining himself in power. Nonetheless, <persName corresp="#p_HC7">Helou</persName> said had discussed question with
                            <persName corresp="#p_KR6">Karame</persName> to try to forestall action
                        which would aggravate problem of future Sixth Fleet visits.</p>
                    <p>5. I made it clear to <persName corresp="#p_HC7">Helou</persName> that if
                        Syria's so-called “government” able to pressure Lebanon into actions which
                        might mean practical withdrawal Sixth Fleet from Eastern Mediterranean, this
                        would appear have tragic consequences not only for Lebanon but for peace in
                        the area as a whole.</p>
                    <pb n="804" xml:id="pg_804" facs="0836"/>
                    <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_HC7">Helou</persName> said unfortunately no
                        delineated border exists between Lebanon and Syria and as consequence there
                        is not only unauthorized physical passage across borders but also free
                        passage ideas and propaganda. <persName corresp="#p_HC7">Helou</persName>
                        tied issue Sixth Fleet visits to US policy of assistance to Lebanon and said
                            <persName corresp="#p_KR6">Karame</persName> needs help. Explained that
                        if <gloss target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss> could point to tangible US assistance
                        offer to Lebanon, situation of <gloss target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss> would be
                        much easier in respect to staving off mounting pressures for cancelling
                        Sixth Fleet visits (see Embtel 9598).<note n="4" xml:id="d409fn4">
                            <ref target="#d408">Document 408</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>7. I reiterated to <persName corresp="#p_HC7">Helou</persName> that it
                        basically in Lebanon's interest have Fleet visits and only Cairo, Damascus,
                        and other states interested in eliminating US presence in garble would stand
                        to gain if Lebanon refused visits.</p>
                    <p>Comment: <persName corresp="#p_HC7">Helou</persName> has of course always
                        been staunch supporter Sixth Fleet visits, and needs no reminders of
                        significance of Fleet to Lebanon. His inability, for the first time, to give
                        me flat reassurances that visits will continue, is indication of the hard
                        political dilemma with which he (and Lebanon) are faced.</p>
                    <p>9. Nonetheless, <gloss target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss> is trying hard keep Sixth
                        Fleet issue from coming to head. Cancellation of general Parliamentary
                        debate April 19 through lack of quorum undoubtedly <persName corresp="#p_KR6">Karame</persName> ploy to avoid taking public position
                        in response to inevitable hostile questioning. He will have take hard line
                        position, against his better judgment, if pressures become too intense, but
                        will probably hold out for a while longer in hope US assistance offer will
                        enable him show tangible evidence US support for <gloss target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss>'s economic and social objectives.</p>
                    <p>10. This is going to be another typically Lebanese issue where the final
                        decision will be based largely on external influences and only secondarily
                        on rational self-interest of the country.<note n="5" xml:id="d409fn5">Telegram 10510 from Beirut, May 15, reported that <persName corresp="#p_HC7">Helou</persName> informed Porter that day that area

                    <p>2. On other hand, we are disturbed by <persName corresp="#p_HC7">Helou</persName>'s analysis of Lebanese political situation. In
                        particular, his apparent assessment that moderates might be relinquishing
                        initiative to anti-Western elements seems unduly pessimistic. We tend to
                        feel that <persName corresp="#p_HC7">Helou</persName> failed to mention
                        those groups in Lebanon (including military) whom, we feel, would not stand
                        by idly in face of bid for power for Left. We recognize that Lebanon is
                        probably now in a political drift and that continued reluctance to stand up
                        to those who seek to undermine its integrity might entail a relinquishment
                        of that integrity. However, we feel situation need not necessarily lead to
                        disintegration of forces which have held Lebanon together, particularly if
                        moderates are given positive leadership. It had been our understanding that
                        most political leaders were in agreement that extremism must be contained
                        for sake of Lebanon's future welfare.</p>
                    <p>3. We would therefore appreciate receiving the Embassy's analysis of
                        President <persName corresp="#p_HC7">Helou</persName>'s assessment, and its
                        projection of Lebanon's political future in the light of that analysis. In
                        particular, (a) will responsible political leaders allow the present drift
                        to get out of hand? (b) Is existing power structure seriously threatened?
                        What are the alternatives? How would these alternatives affect U.S.
                        interests? (c) Will those who have benefited most under Lebanon's system of
                        private enterprise be unwilling to accept larger degree of control over
                        their power and wealth as insurance against extremism? (d) Will net effect
                        of knowledge of “massive Soviet aid offer” referred to by <persName corresp="#p_HC7">Helou</persName> be strengthening or weakening <pb n="807" xml:id="pg_807" facs="0839"/>of moderates? (e) What would be
                        political impact in Lebanon if Soviet projects carried out? (f) Would
                        existing power structure accept a significant Soviet bloc influence in
                            Lebanon?<note n="4" xml:id="d411fn4">Telegram 9869 from Beirut, April
                            27, conveyed the Embassy's analysis. It stated that although most
                            Lebanese political leaders preferred to follow a pro-Western neutrality,
                            this was a difficult task when the Egyptians, Syrians, and Soviets were
                            attacking the United States for a variety of reasons, including policy
                            toward Israel, Vietnam, and aid to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>; it would be impossible if the Soviets offered sizable
                            aid to Lebanon and the United States did nothing. The Embassy thought no
                            Lebanese Government could survive turning down Soviet aid under those
                            circumstances. It concluded that if the United States sought to retain
                            the advantages it derived from Lebanon's free economic and political
                            systems and pro-Western stance, it would have to provide support along
                            the lines requested by the Lebanese leadership. (Ibid., POL LEB)</note>

                    <p>The Acting Secretary asked jocularly if Mr. Younes had discovered any oil on
                        his visit to the United States. Mr. Younes had said that he was trying to
                        discover more American explorers for Egypt's oil. The TENNECO Company was
                        interested in two areas in the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. Some
                        difficulties had cropped up in the TENNECO/<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> negotiations but Mr. Younes felt that these could be
                        reconciled. The <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> had a great interest not
                        only in oil production but in such related enterprises as petro-chemicals,
                        insecticides, and fertilizer industries. Mr. Younes had <pb n="808" xml:id="pg_808" facs="0840"/>also talked to the leadership of Phillips
                        and Standard of Indiana. With the latter, studies were going forward as to
                        how the best use could be made of the gas which would be a byproduct of the
                        oil operations at el-Murgan Field. He acknowledged that Standard of Indiana
                        had had a mixed experience with the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>.
                        There had been lengthy delays in previous negotiations. Mr. Younes said he
                        was now in full charge of oil matters in the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. There was a brief discussion of the type of arrangement
                        being made between the Egyptian Oil Authority and Phillips. Although the
                        joint company would have three Egyptian and only two American members, it
                        had been agreed that no vote would be binding unless at least one American
                        were in the majority.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Younes said that as result of his talks with the oil companies he had the
                        feeling that they would like some kind of statement of support and
                        encouragement from the US Government.</p>
                    <p>The Acting Secretary was then briefly called out of the room. In his absence
                        a discussion between Ambassador Nolte and Mr. Younes ensued as to the
                        practicability of a semi-autonomous Tourism Authority, along the lines of
                        the Suez Canal Authority, which could make binding cost-plus contracts with
                        foreign investors and management organizations in the tourism field.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> then returned and asked
                        Mr. Younes how he viewed the economic picture in the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. Mr. Younes replied that the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> would need two or three years to balance its situation. The
                        Americans could play a great role in this through their oil companies. The
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> hoped to double its oil production
                        next year, achieving an additional 7–1/2 million tons from the Murgan Field.
                        Then Phillips would follow and <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                        production would shortly be tripled.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> commented that what
                        was crucial was what we did in the meantime. Perhaps it would be as long as
                        five years before the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> could stand on its
                        feet economically. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName>
                        gave a lengthy expose of his “plan” for the improvement of US–<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> relations. This involved a) <gloss target="#t_CCC1">CCC</gloss> roll-over,<note n="2" xml:id="d412fn2">An

                        external debt situation. Throughout Kamel's presentation ran the theme that
                        the USSR could only stand to benefit from continuing poor relations between
                        the US and the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. He felt that political
                        difficulties between the US and the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                        could be “frozen” while economic cooperation was increased.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> agreed that ways of
                        cooperation must be found. He did not feel that relations between the United
                        States and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> were the principal
                        problem in US–<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> relations. He saw the
                        situation more in terms of problems between the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and the United States. He was delighted that Egypt had
                        reached an agreement with the Fund. He could not comment on what the
                        International Bank might do. He felt that the Egyptians would have real
                        problems with regard to their current economic situation. These problems
                        entered even into the question of the CCC roll-over. He felt that measures
                        which the Egyptians might take to stimulate private investment were
                        important and was all for them. But US ability to assist had to be
                        considered in terms of the political difficulties between the two countries.
                        These could not be wished away. The US wanted good relations with the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Younes felt that this made it the right time for both sides to move
                        forward. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> referred to
                        the need for Congressional support for many of the actions which the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> would like us to do. This could be
                        difficult to obtain. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName>
                        stated there was a need in the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> for a new
                        start in US–<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> relations. He had carefully
                        explained to Cairo the complexities of US constitutional processes, but now
                        some moves were required on the part of the United States. Presently there
                        existed a genuine vacuum of cooperation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> pointed out that the improvement of relations was
                        a two-way street. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KM2">Kamel</persName> stated
                        that the US as a big power should exercise more patience.</p>

                                held in Jerusalem on May 15.</note>
                        </item>
                    </list>
                    <p>We are in the midst of our annual hassle over whether Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Barbour</persName> should go to Israel's parade in
                        Jerusalem. He would go if both the French and British Ambassadors were
                        going. But London has decided at Cabinet level that its Ambassador should
                        not go this year, and Paris has agreed.</p>
                    <p>The issue is where we draw the line in lending our presence to ceremonies
                        which further recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital. <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolutions of 1949–50 recommended that
                        Jerusalem be placed under international administration. We have gone along
                        with this position. Although we do business with Israeli government offices
                        in Jerusalem, we have refused legally to recognize it as Israel's capital
                        and have kept our embassy in Tel Aviv. While the conditions that led to our
                        initial position have changed, we don't believe we should change that
                        position unless in the context of some Arab-Israeli settlement. Doing so
                        otherwise would kick off a tremendous Arab reaction.</p>
                    <p>State really doesn't feel our presence makes that much legal difference
                        because we've been to other such functions in Jerusalem. But it does fear
                        that the Israelis and Arabs would read great significance if we broke with
                        the British and French on the issue. We could probably get <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> to promise not to exploit our
                        presence, but we can't stave off some Arab reaction. The Jordanian Foreign
                        Minister has already formally asked us not to attend. He feels that Jordan
                        is especially vulnerable to Arab criticism because of Jordan's close
                        relationship with us.</p>
                    <p>The issue is not the parade itself but the fact that the Israeli government
                        uses this kind of thing to nibble away at the Western position. The British
                        have decided—at the Cabinet level after two reviews and considerable Jewish
                        pressure—that they must draw the line somewhere and that this is the place.
                        In 1965, they attended a tattoo in Jerusalem after the Israelis assured them
                        they'd make nothing of it and then six weeks later Eshkol cited British and
                        American presence as a significant <pb n="811" xml:id="pg_811" facs="0843"/>step toward Western recognition of Israel's status in Jerusalem. The
                        British were burned up, and there's a good bit of their annoyance in this
                        year's decision.</p>
                    <p>The Israelis are telling us informally that our refusal to attend will
                        provoke a crisis in our relations. That's nonsense, and we can probably talk
                        them out of that line. But unfortunately they can read our absence as the
                        kind of aloofness that doesn't help you here at home.</p>
                    <p>Personally, I can't get excited about whether we go to the parade or not, and
                        I think the British may be drawing the line at the wrong place. But they do
                        make one important point. There's no question that every Israeli move like
                        this is calculated “salami tactics.” Unhappily, there is no such thing with
                        this tough-minded, always-negotiating government—much as I love the Israelis
                        as people—as just making a nice gesture without having them attach
                        significance to it.</p>
                    <p>The main issue in this as in the aid package is whether we're now ready to
                        throw open the gates to Israel or whether we're still willing to draw the
                        line somewhere to preserve some balance between our Arab and Israeli
                        policies. They think they've made a breakthrough with you on the tank and
                        planes sales, and they're trying to exploit it to the hilt.</p>
                    <p>I hate to see something like this cause you trouble, and I think the British
                        have made a wrong decision. But Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> has decided we ought to go along with them and
                        the French, and if there were no domestic concern, I wouldn't even bother
                        you with this. He has not asked our review, but I asked to put this before
                        you. You can either let his decision stand, or I can ask him to take a
                        second look if you are concerned.</p>

                            them not to make an issue of it. Johnson's response is conveyed in an
                            attached May 4 note telling him to talk to David Ginsburg and “see if

                    <p>As requested I have reviewed the recommendations from the Department and it
                        is my own recommendation that you respond to Israel's request as
                        follows:</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">I. Military</p>
                    <p>A. You authorize the sale rather than grant of 100 <gloss target="#t_APC1">APC</gloss>'s to Israel, half the number Israel has requested on a
                        grant basis—on current non-concessional credit terms. The delivery schedule
                        should be based simply on availability rather than stretched-out delivery.
                        Israel should be requested to limit or avoid publicity on the transaction.
                        Key congressmen should be briefed, using modernization needs as the basic
                        justification for the sale. In my view there will be no difficulty with the
                        Congress on this point. This is in essence the fallback recommendation of
                        the Department except for the delivery schedule which the Department would
                        stretch out and which in my view is unnecessarily harsh on Israel.</p>
                    <p>B. I agree with the Department's recommendation that if manufacturing
                        facilities for the Skyhawk A–4H aircraft make a speed up impossible, we will
                        not be able to grant this request. It should be recalled, however, that at
                        the time of the Jordan proceedings in the Security Council we did commit
                        ourselves to an expedited schedule for delivery of these airplanes.</p>
                    <p>C. I agree with the Department's recommendation that we agree to Israel's
                        request to establish “fifth echelon” facilities for the Hawk missile system
                        insofar as such facilities relate to maintenance rather than production or
                        resale of missiles.</p>
                    <p>D. I recommend that we agree, as a one time exception to policy, to provide
                        $4 million credit for Hawk spare parts and $10 million for tank spare parts,
                        this latter figure being the figure mentioned in the original deal. The
                        Department's fallback position calls for a $9 million credit. I believe we
                        can meet Israel's request for an additional $5 million credit, since a
                        credit rather than a grant is involved and the difference is relatively
                        small. The terms should not be the more onerous terms <pb n="813" xml:id="pg_813" facs="0845"/>proposed by the Department but rather the
                        terms of the original deal; i.e., a 3–1/2% interest rate and a pay back
                        period of 10 years. To overcome the objection that this would establish a
                        precedent in a supplementary credit deal, the original contract could be
                        re-written to make this credit part of the original commitment.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">II. Economic</p>
                    <p>A. Israel has requested development loans of $20 million. The Department
                        would deny this request and refer Israel to the Export-Import Bank. I
                        recognize the difficulties involved here but perhaps we could consider
                        settling this request, as was done last year, by a $10 million development
                        loan and by a $10 million Export-Import Bank loan, or if this is not
                        possible, by assuring prompt and favorable consideration of the $20 million
                        loan by the Bank.</p>
                    <p>B. I agree with the Department's recommendation that we agree to Israel's
                        request for <hi rend="italic">permission to bid on AID supporting assistance
                            purchases of potash and phosphate fertilizers primarily for South Viet
                            Nam and South Korea</hi> for a period not to exceed 12 months. This is
                        also to our advantage since it involves Israel in aid to South Viet Nam.</p>
                    <p>C. I recommend that we agree to Israel's request for commodities under the
                        Food-for-Freedom Program by providing commodities, excluding wheat, of $26.5
                        million on the basis of Israel's requirements and our own availabilities.
                        Israel has asked for $35–36 million including wheat. The Department
                        recommends a range of $19 to $23.5 million. I believe the figure I suggest
                        $26.5 million is a good compromise. The Department's proposals, moreover,
                        are too severe with respect to payment and Israel's are too liberal. I
                        suggest a compromise, i.e., 50% local currency and 50% dollar credit sales
                        to be paid over twenty years but at the same interest rate as last year,
                        i.e., 2–1/2%.</p>
                    <p>D. I agree with the Department's proposal that we give sympathetic
                        consideration to further support of Israel's assistance programs in Africa
                        along the lines of past support for programs which indirectly benefit us
                        (Central African Republic, Chad, and Dahomey), within the limitations
                        imposed by the revised strategy for United States aid to Africa.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">General Comment:</p>
                    <p>What I have suggested, in my view, is a reasonable compromise which will be
                        acceptable to the Israelis and to American public opinion and would not
                        prejudice our relations with Arabic states.</p>
                    <p>Finally, I should like to suggest as a replacement for Ambassador Ellsworth
                        Bunker as your representative on the American-Israel Joint Nuclear
                        Desalinization project that you consider the appointment of <persName corresp="#p_VJJ1">Jack Valenti</persName>. This would follow the
                        tradition of Presidents Truman and Eisenhower who appointed <persName corresp="#p_VJJ1">Jack</persName>'s predecessor at the Motion Picture <pb n="814" xml:id="pg_814" facs="0846"/>Association, Eric Johnston, as a

                        to the solution of the problems involved. This, I know, would be a highly
                        agreeable appointment to all concerned.</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Conventional Forces</hi>. Israel has a safe margin of
                        superiority over any combination of Arab forces likely to attack it and can
                        be expected to maintain that position for at least the next five years. Arab
                        numerical force superiority is more than matched by Israel's superiority in
                        training, leadership, military doctrine and maintenance of equipment.
                        Moreover, the Arab states have made little progress in military coordination
                        among themselves. Recent border clashes have demonstrated that short of
                        general hostilities, or Israeli occupation of Arab territory, the Arab
                        states will not rush to one another's assistance. In practical terms,
                        therefore, Israel's security must be measured by its ability to maintain
                        military superiority over the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, the
                        strongest single Arab state that can challenge Israel.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Nuclear Weapons</hi>. Concerned that over the long run the
                        Arabs will achieve superiority in conventional forces, Israel is carefully
                        preserving <pb n="815" xml:id="pg_815" facs="0847"/>its option to acquire
                        sophisticated weapons, including, we believe, nuclear weapons. We have no
                        evidence that Israel is actually making a bomb, but we believe Israel
                        intends to keep itself in a position to do so at reasonably short notice
                        should the need arise. The Israeli reactor at Dimona is capable of producing
                        enough plutonium to make one or two bombs a year, but thus far our periodic
                        inspections of this facility (most recently on April 22, 1967) have
                        uncovered no evidence of weapons activity. Our inspectors emphasize,
                        however, that their visits cover only the Dimona site and there can be no
                        assurance that the Israelis are not pursuing a clandestine weapons program
                            elsewhere.<note n="2" xml:id="d415fn2">A “Preliminary Report of the
                            Visit to Atomic Energy Sites in Israel, April 20 to April 24, 1967:

                            Israel-Nuclear-Dimona-Desalting.</note> Our suspicions that we do not
                        know the full story have been heightened by the Israelis' unwillingness to
                        tell us what happened to 80–100 tons of unsafeguarded uranium concentrate
                        that they bought from Argentina 4 years ago. We have also had reports that
                        Israel has acquired a nuclear chemical separation plant, which—if true—would
                        be a significant step toward a weapons capability. These reports are being
                        urgently investigated.</p>
                    <p>On the Arab side, no state is anywhere near a nuclear weapons capability. The
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> has a small 2-megawatt research
                        reactor which cannot produce significant amounts of plutonium.</p>
                    <p>Both <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> are on record as saying that their
                        countries will not be the first to introduce nuclear weapons into the area.
                        Beyond this, however, neither the Egyptians nor the Israelis have accepted
                            <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards over their entire
                        nuclear programs, in spite of our urging them to do so. The <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>'s position is that so far they have nothing
                        that requires safeguarding whereas Israel does and should therefore be the
                        one that takes the first step. Israel's position is more complex. Israelis
                        have stressed to us their concern that information obtained by <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> inspectors, which might be available to
                        the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, could aid the latter in planning a
                        military or sabotage operation against Dimona. In terms of their long-range
                        security the Israelis may also have decided that they will not accept
                        limitations upon their sophisticated weapon option in the absence of Arab
                        arms control undertakings in the conventional field.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Ballistic Missiles</hi>. Israel has contracted with the
                        French firm of Dassault to purchase an unknown quantity of
                        surface-to-surface ballistic missiles. These missiles are capable of
                        carrying nuclear warheads and would not be militarily cost-effective unless
                        so used. The missile (designated the MD–620) is now being flight-tested by
                        the French. None have apparently been delivered to Israel as yet, but
                        initial deliveries could <pb n="816" xml:id="pg_816" facs="0848"/>take place
                        sometime in 1968. Latest evidence indicates that, despite some difficulties
                        with the guidance system, the MD–620 program is moving forward. Israel is
                        also pursuing an indigenous <gloss target="#t_SSM1">SSM</gloss> R&amp;D
                        program.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>'s <gloss target="#t_SSM1">SSM</gloss>
                        program, though widely advertised for many years, has reached a virtual
                        standstill. Most of the West German scientists who were assisting this
                        effort have departed. Flight testing of the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> missiles has been suspended, and it is estimated that the
                        missile program, at its present level of activity, could not be successfully
                        completed within the next decade.</p>
                    <p>Soviet Policy. Although the Soviets have gained much from their large sales
                        of conventional weapons to certain Arab countries, we believe it unlikely
                        that they will help any Arab state toward a nuclear weapons capability.
                        There is similarly no hard evidence of Soviet assistance on the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>'s missile program.</p>
                    <p>U.S. Initiatives. The coming months may well offer our best opportunity in
                        years to press for our arms control objectives because of two possible forms
                        of additional leverage—first, a non-proliferation treaty, and second, U.S.
                        willingness to finance desalting plants in the area. We plan to pursue our
                        objectives along the following lines.</p>
                    <p>1. Safeguards and the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>. We hope the
                        non-proliferation treaty will prove to be a vehicle to help us get both
                        Israel and the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> to accept safeguards over
                        their nuclear programs. Much will depend on whether the treaty emerges with
                        a strong safeguards clause. As soon as the U.S. is ready to table a draft
                        treaty at the <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss>, we plan to discuss it
                        with the Israelis and the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. We are also
                        exploring ways of overcoming Israel's suspicions of the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>, including the possibility of getting
                        Israel a seat on the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> Board of
                        Governors.</p>
                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Ballistic Missiles</hi>. In May last year we raised with
                        Eshkol our concern over Israel's plans to acquire ballistic missiles.
                            <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> said Israel would not
                        acquire <gloss target="#t_SSM1">SSM</gloss>'s “for two, maybe three years.”
                        He indicated that if <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
                        “abandoned” his missile program, Israel would do likewise. Since the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>'s program has remained inactive in the
                        intervening year, we plan to raise this again with <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> in the near future. Our objective is
                        to try to achieve a tacit understanding with the Israelis and Egyptians for
                        mutual forebearance in the further development of their <gloss target="#t_SSM1">SSM</gloss> programs. If <persName corresp="#p_EL2">Eshkol</persName> is receptive, we are prepared to approach <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>.</p>
                    <p>3. Talks with the Soviets. Our probes of the Soviets concerning arms control
                        in the Arab-Israel context have elicited little show of interest thus far.
                        We do not expect that the Soviets will be receptive to an approach on
                        controlling the supply of conventional weapons. However, depending on the
                        course of U.S.-Soviet negotiations on the nonproliferation treaty, we may
                        have a renewed opportunity to take up the problem of nuclear weapons and
                        missiles in the Near East.</p>
                    <pb n="817" xml:id="pg_817" facs="0849"/>
                    <p>4. Put More Punch Into Our Arms Control Discussions with the Israelis. We are
                        disappointed not only in the lack of progress of our arms control
                        discussions with the Israelis but in the lack of Israeli candor that has
                        characterized them. There is a large area of Israeli activity and planning
                        that is a closed book to us. During the coming year we would like to see
                        arms control results linked more directly to Israel's requests for military
                        and economic aid.</p>
                    <p>Continuing Intelligence Surveillance. While our inspections of Dimona can
                        reassure us concerning activities there, they leave open the possibility of
                        Israeli weapons activity somewhere else in Israel. For this reason
                        continuing surveillance of Israel by every means at our disposal must remain
                        a high priority intelligence requirement. We intend also to keep a watch on
                        Israeli efforts to acquire in other countries equipment and technology
                        related to nuclear weapon and missile programs.</p>

                            package in three columns, headed “Israeli Request,” “<persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>
                            Proposal,” and “Your Decision.” A copy is in the Johnson Library,
                            National Security File, Country File, Israel Aid, 5/67.</note> It gives
                        the Israelis almost everything they want, except on <gloss target="#t_APC1">APC</gloss>'s.</p>
                    <p>The one major difference between <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Arthur</persName>'s recommendation and the Secretaries' indicates the
                        Secretaries' continuing concern over providing <gloss target="#t_APC1">APC</gloss>'s. They propose only that we license sale of 100 <gloss target="#t_APC1">APC</gloss>'s for cash, while <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Arthur</persName> recommends credit sale on
                        no-concessional terms.</p>
                    <p>The main issue remains how closely we should identify ourselves with Israel
                        in view of its unclear nuclear intentions and our interests in the Arab
                        world. I understand—and share—your desire to do everything we can to help
                        the Israelis. On the other hand, we know that every request they make is not
                        only a request for help but part of an effort to maneuver us into closer and
                        closer identification. They feel they've made a breakthrough in the tank and
                        plane sales and are pushing hard to exploit it.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> team found no evidence that Israel is
                        using Dimona to produce material for use in nuclear weapons. While this
                        conclusion is encouraging, it can't tell us one way or the other whether
                        Israel may be pressing a clandestine weapons program elsewhere. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> concludes (Tab C)<note n="5" xml:id="d416fn5">
                            <ref target="#d415">Document 415</ref>.</note> that Israel is carefully
                        preserving its option to produce nuclear weapons on short notice if it needs
                        to. Our intelligence proves nothing, but there are enough unanswered
                        questions to make us want to avoid getting locked in too closely with
                        Israel.</p>
                    <p>In addition, State and Defense worry about our substantial interests in the
                        Arab world. I know you are keenly aware of our oil interests ($2.75 billion
                        investment, $750 million in yearly profits in production alone plus
                        downstream operations) and of our obligations to our Arab friends. Our
                        greatest single liability there—and one of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s greatest assets—is the sincere Arab belief that the
                        “Zionists exercise a veto on US policy.”</p>
                    <p>These important concerns account for the rough passage this package has had.
                        The alternative to selling <gloss target="#t_APC1">APC</gloss>'s now would
                        be to tell the Israelis that our agreement to their full requests for credit
                        on military spares ($14 million) is all we can do this year but that we'll
                        consider the <gloss target="#t_APC1">APC</gloss>'s along with other requests
                        they've already made for the next generation of Israeli weapons. In fact,
                        that $14 million alone is a substantial concession—larger than the whole
                        cost of the Jordan package ($12 million) including airlift costs. If you
                        approve <gloss target="#t_APC1">APC</gloss>'s, we will need to control
                        publicity.</p>

                            the President states that two Americans at the AID mission in Yemen had
                            been charged with attempting to destroy the city of Taiz. It comments
                            that in both Cairo and Yemen, some groups wanted to get rid of
                            connections with the United States, and that those groups appeared to
                            have won. It states, “We shall be announcing tomorrow that the charges
                            are without foundation—which they are.” (Ibid., Memos to the President,

                            men were released on May 17. For further information concerning this
                            episode, see the Yemen compilation in <ref target="frus1964-68v21">Foreign Relations, 1964–1968, volume XXI</ref>.</note> We've

                        there. If we get these two out safely, our main loss will be some <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> material the Egyptians filched from one of
                        the safes left behind when our people were dragged off.</p>
                    <p>We don't think <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> staged the
                        incident in Yemen to get us out. However, once Egyptian mishandling on the
                        scene created an opening, Cairo gave vent to its emotions and played it out
                        for its full propaganda and intelligence advantage. Their readiness to see
                        us humiliated and their duplicity illustrate the bitterness they feel toward
                        us, while their willingness to set limits against harm to our people
                        suggests they want to stop short of an open break.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> summed up the reason for this
                        bitterness in his 2 May speech: “… you do not consider us your friends.” To
                        him, our cutting back food aid is the final evidence that we are working
                        against him and want to see him crushed under his economic burdens. But
                        above all, he sees <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>'s hand behind
                        everything that goes wrong for him. In his final talk with Luke Battle, he
                        admitted he is a “suspicious man,” but he also claims he has evidence that
                            <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> is working to topple him. It was
                        natural for him to see a sinister hand behind AID's roadbuilding work in
                        southern Yemen where Egyptians are training the “liberation army” for South
                        Arabia.</p>
                    <p>We've held our tempers so far, but getting our men out of jail may take the
                        lid off strong pent-up desire to wash our hands of <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>. The Egyptians have maddeningly
                        violated every code of diplomatic practice—despite Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>'s strong statement on the “rights of
                        legation”—and they've used more poison gas in Yemen. Yet on the constructive
                        side, they have reached agreement with the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>, entertained American businessmen, are negotiating with
                        another American oil company and are trying to avoid defaulting on debt
                        repayments to us. While the temptation to break will be greater than ever,
                        cooler heads will probably prevail. With the South Arabian problem reaching
                        center stage, we'll badly need someone on the scene in Cairo.</p>

                        Israel. In summary, <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName>'s view is
                        that Syrians creating dangerous situation, without any restraint. In
                        reviewing recent series incidents, <persName corresp="#p_HA3">Harman</persName> emphasized that Syrians are making increased use
                        Lebanese territory to hit at Israel, are penetrating region hitherto quite
                        free from terrorism (the area immediately north of Lake Tiberias), and are
                        suddenly putting mines on major metalled roads. Fact there have been no
                        casualties fortunate but does not diminish Syrian guilt and obvious
                        terrorist intention include women and children among victims.</p>

                        of terrorism bestows on it some immunity from Israeli response any more than
