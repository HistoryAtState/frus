                                    Committee, on the Draft Bill Regarding Trade with the Enemy</hi>
                                <note n="2" xml:id="d1fn2">According to a letter from the Secretary
                                    of the Treasury, this committee was designated in the Cabinet
                                    meeting of Apr. 3, 1917, and was to be composed of the Secretary
                                    of State, the Attorney General, and the Secretary of Commerce.
                                    (File No. 763.72112/10418.)</note>
                            </head>
                            <p>The memorandum referred to the War Trade Committee included the
                                question of the control of exports in time of war. The committee
                                respectfully submits, therefore, a draft of a bill that is believed
                                to cover this subject.<note n="3" xml:id="d1fn3">Not printed.</note>
                            </p>
                            <p>The reasons for urging the control of exports during the period of
                                the war may be grouped under two main heads: (1) by this means goods
                                are prevented from reaching the enemy; (2) economic considerations
                                make such action imperative. If we are to keep the Allies supplied
                                with food and materials to the extent suggested by the President in
                                his message to Congress, careful supervision will be necessary in
                                order to curtail our exports of certain important materials to
                                countries not actually employing them in the prosecution of the war.
                                For example, there is at the present moment a serious shortage of
                                tin plate. It occurs to the War Trade Committee that in order to
                                insure the supply of tin plate necessary for food containers during
                                the coming season, it may be desirable to prohibit the exportation
                                of tin plate. No detailed argument is necessary to demonstrate the
                                necessity of carefully supervising, and in all probability
                                restricting, <pb n="800" xml:id="pg_800" facs="0046"/>our exports of
                                foodstuffs to other than Allied countries. Important metals such as
                                lead, zinc, copper and important alloys such as ferrotungsten we
                                cannot afford to export to countries other than those allied with
                                the United States in the prosecution of the war.</p>
                            <p>It is respectfully submitted that the prompt enactment by Congress of
                                legislation embodying the provisions of the bill hereto attached is
                                a matter of urgent national importance.</p>
                            <p>To administer the export-prohibitions act, the War Trade Committee
                                respectfully recommends that an auxiliary committee of this
                                committee be created by Executive order, to be known as the Exports
                                Control Committee. This committee, we believe, should consist of a
                                representative from each of the following executive departments:
                                War, Navy, State, Treasury, Commerce, Interior, and Agriculture.
                                Some member of the War Trade Committee should be a member and act as
                                a chairman of the Exports Control Committee.</p>
                            <p>It should be the duty of the Exports Control Committee to recommend
                                to the President the prohibition of exportation of any articles,
                                subject to export licenses granted. This committee should frame
                                rules and regulations governing the issuance of such licenses.</p>
                            <p>The committee could receive valuable assistance from leading business
                                men in the various industries that would be affected by the
                                restriction of exports, and to this end it should appoint
                                subcommittees to deal with various groups of articles, e. g.,
                                foodstuffs, coals, metals, ores and alloys, hides and leather,
                                rubber, etc. A representative of the Government department most
                                concerned should sit on each subcommittee.</p>
                            <p>We believe the actual issuance of licenses, as well as any other
                                detail work in connection with keeping the records of the Exports
                                Control Committee, could be performed most advantageously in the
                                Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce of the Department of
                                Commerce, which has complete information regarding the country’s
                                foreign trade and is in close touch with the productive industries
                                of the country that are most interested in export trade.</p>
                            <p>To the Treasury Department would naturally fall the duty of seeing
                                that no prohibited article was exported. In other words, the Customs
                                Service in the various ports would require the production of a
                                license before permitting the exportation of any article on the
                                prohibited list.</p>
                            <p>It is respectfully suggested that the Exports Control Committee (in
                                case the appointment of such a supervisory body meets with your
                                approval) will have a vast amount of preliminary work to do in the
                                way of conferring with representatives of our exporting industries
                                in <pb n="801" xml:id="pg_801" facs="0047"/>order to determine the
                                policy to be pursued with respect to the restriction of exportation
                                of various articles, and that authority should therefore be given to
                                commence this preliminary work at the earliest possible date.</p>
                            <p>Respectfully submitted,</p>

                                    <p>My Dear Ambassador: In view of recent events you will be glad
                                        to hear that the Government has decided to withdraw the
                                        statutory black list as far as the United States are
                                        concerned.</p>
                                    <p>The essential principles of the law with respect to trading
                                        with the enemy are the same in your country and ours and we
                                        are quite content to rely upon the full application of that
                                        law which will no doubt take place to give us the security
                                        which we sought to obtain by the statutory list.</p>
                                    <p>It was as we always insisted a purely war measure and now
                                        that its war purposes will be attained by other means, we
                                        hasten to withdraw it.</p>
                                    <p>May I take this opportunity of expressing on behalf of my
                                        colleagues and myself our great regret that this measure
                                        should have caused misunderstandings between our two
                                        countries. When we instituted the statutory list we had no
                                        intention of affronting or injuring the American people and
                                        we deeply regret that our action should have been so
                                        interpreted in some quarters.</p>
                                    <p>Yours very sincerely,</p>

                                                either by actually winding them up or by placing

                                                should immediately consider the issue of a complete
                                                list of prohibited exports so far as possible
                                                identical with our list, the export of any goods on

                                            <item>In view of the fact that the United States is not
                                                at war with Germany’s allies it is difficult to see
                                                how, unless some special steps are taken outside the

                                                (especially) Austria-Hungary, it will be possible to
                                                detect cases where business is done with Austrian
                                                houses on German account. We can only leave it to
                                                the United States to decide on the particular
                                                measures required.</item>

                                    <p>We should like the United States Government to consider
                                        whether all these three classes of measures should not be
                                        adopted before any public announcement is made of the
                                        withdrawal of our statutory list in the United States, since
                                        otherwise there will be a serious gap in administrative
                                        measures restricting enemy trade. The result might be and
                                        probably would be that Germanophil firms would seize the
                                        opportunity to make important remittances to enemy countries
                                        which would be very undesirable. If the public announcement
                                        is postponed till measures of this kind can be put into
                                        force we could, I think, at the moment when the public
                                        announcement is finally made, simultaneously withdraw from
                                        operation the confidential black lists so far as they relate
                                        to United States firms, especially the list circulated to
                                        our bankers of firms whose transactions it is undesirable to
                                        finance, commonly called the finance black list. The
                                        establishment of a system similar to that in force in the

                                resumes the course of a conversation which I had some days ago with
                                the British officials named, with regard to the above very important
                                matter [British proposals, informally submitted, respecting carrying

                                    to suggest in unrestrained language what they then had in mind
                                    as desirable from their point of view, even though it might not
                                    be possible from ours, and stated their intention of sending a
                                    formal communication on the subject to <persName
                                        corresp="frus1917Supp02v01#p_CLR1">Lord Robert
                                        Cecil</persName>, which no doubt will reach you in due
                                    time.</p>
                                <p>Our friends in the Blockade Department are quite prepared to
                                    believe, I think, that the Department of State will not recede
                                    from its expressed position on points of law, and that it will
                                    consider the blockade to be just as illegal after we go to war
                                    as now, and will have a still poorer opinion of the black list;
                                    but they probably hope that the Department will recognize these
                                    weapons as existing <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi>, and will
                                    assume towards them, if I may so express it, an attitude of
                                    benevolent neutrality.</p>
                                <p>At the present time all goods which leave the United Kingdom [<hi
                                        rend="italic">States</hi>] for European destinations,
                                    practically without exception, are covered by British “letters
                                    of assurance” or equivalent documents. This means that the
                                    shippers consult the British authorities in the United States
                                    before forwarding their goods, and give certain guarantees that
                                    the ultimate destination of the goods is satisfactory. Then the
                                    ship proceeds upon its way, and the cargo is examined either at
                                    Halifax, Kirkwall or Lerwick, to see that it is in order, and
                                    the enforced call at an intermediate port of course involves
                                    considerable danger to the ship, and great loss of time in the
                                    manipulation of the cargo. It would be very agreeable to the
                                    people here if they might be permitted to perfect machinery in
                                    the United States for examining cargoes before putting goods
                                    into the ship, and then seal the holds and check up papers, thus
                                    obviating the necessity of undertaking similar operations at an
                                    intermediate port. From a purely commercial point of view, it
                                    would be to the advantage of the carrying vessels to be held up
                                    for a day or two longer in New York while this scrutiny was
                                    going on, if, by so doing, they might avoid an enforced visit to
                                    Halifax, Kirkwall or Lerwick. Furthermore, the danger to the
                                    ship would be considerably reduced. Ships thus examined at New
                                    York, on passing through the blockade line, would identify
                                    themselves very quickly, and would proceed to final destination.
                                    The people here think that if we raise no objections to this
                                    plan, the commercial interests involved would ask for its
                                    application just as they now ask for letters of assurance; and
                                    the position then would be that they would be under no
                                    obligation to submit to this investigation if they were willing
                                    to take the chance of getting through the blockade without
                                    “voluntarily” allowing themselves to be examined.</p>
                                <p>A more spiny problem in connection with the departure of ships
                                    from the United States arises in connection with passengers and
                                    the <pb n="805" xml:id="pg_805" facs="0051"/>handling of mails.
                                    People here assume that on the outbreak of war we ourselves
                                    shall adopt very stringent regulations respecting east-bound
                                    passengers, subjecting them all to the closest scrutiny, and
                                    excluding practically all persons objectionable to British
                                    interests as well as to our own. I think they hope, also, that
                                    their own secret service agents will be permitted to work in
                                    connection with ours, and to support each other. They regard an
                                    understanding of this kind as indispensable, unless ships are to
                                    be brought into an intermediate port, after clearing from New
                                    York.</p>
                                <p>The handling of the mails probably causes more thought here than
                                    anything else. The authorities know that we object to what they
                                    have been doing in the past, and they, on their side, deem it to
                                    be imperatively necessary to continue this scrutiny. Obviously,
                                    ships cannot proceed from New York to European ports without
                                    calling at intermediate ports if mails are to be examined,
                                    unless the examination is undertaken in the United States. While
                                    we shall exercise a censorship, very probably, it is doubted
                                    whether our censorship, unless it can be exercised jointly with
                                    the British authorities, will be satisfactory. The suggestion
                                    was made during our talk that the whole difficulty might be
                                    overcome if the British authorities simply required all mails
                                    for European destinations to be sent in transit through Great
                                    Britain. I think that my informants looked upon the suggestion
                                    of all European mails being sent to Great Britain as somewhat
                                    revolutionary, but at the same time, quite a practical method of
                                    facilitating the dispatch of correspondence.</p>
                                <p>Mr. <persName>Finlay</persName> said that if our people were
                                    willing to meet them in all or some of these plans, they would
                                    be only too happy to grant me access to all their confidential
                                    material with regard to contraband, enemy firms, and the like.
                                    In fact, they look forward to a close exchange of information of
                                    this kind, believing that, as time goes on, our interests will
                                    insensibly merge. I listened with attention to all that was said
                                    to me, merely putting in a question here and there, and without
                                    committing myself in any manner.</p>
                                <p>It is needless to say that if you desire me to step in for a talk
                                    on the general subject I am always at your disposition.</p>

                                        understood both by shippers and importers, should if

                                        fully appreciated that our statistical and other methods
                                        rendered decentralization practically out of the question
                                        and that the system should be worked, as heretofore, from

                                            >Skinner</persName> wished to emphasize his view that
                                        shipments covered by navicerts or by N[etherlands] O[versea]
                                        T[rust] permits should be subjected to no delays except in

                                        goods to the enemy had been discovered. It was considered
                                        that the proportion of navicerts which had been dishonoured
                                        was extremely small, probably no more than one in five
                                        hundred; and it was hoped that the proposed scheme for the
                                        approval in advance of N.O.T. permit would remove any ground
                                        of objection so far as concerned Holland.</item>

                                    Block</persName>, the entry of the United States into the war
                                    raises a question of financial policy of the first magnitude.
                                    There are many neutral banks, both in Latin America and in
                                    Europe, which are known to be actively assisting the enemy by
                                    granting credits as well as in other ways. The Allies have
                                    enforced regulations which prevent any such transactions being
                                    effected through their own financial markets, but so long as the
                                    great financial market of the United States remained open to
                                    these neutral banks, it was, for obvious reasons, difficult for
                                    the Allies to deny to them all Allied facilities for their
                                    business as a whole. If, however, the United States is now
                                    prepared, in the common interest, to cooperate with the Allies
                                    for the purpose of restricting the neutral financial channels
                                    now being used by the enemy, it would become possible absolutely
                                    to close all the chief financial centres of Europe and America
                                    to any neutral bank engaged in upholding enemy trade or credit,
                                    and there can be little doubt that such banks would prefer, in
                                    these circumstances, to restrict, if not entirely to sever their
                                    financial connexion with the enemy. The extent to which, and the
                                    methods by which, such pressure could justly and efficaciously
                                    be applied to each particular case would have to be carefully
                                    and cautiously considered, but it would be of advantage if the
                                    United States Government could without delay decide whether they
                                    are prepared in principle to adopt such a policy.</p>

                                <p>1. As the United States Government naturally and rightly desire
                                    themselves to assume control over the trade of their own
                                    citizens and as it is to the interest of the Allies that, as in
                                    other belligerent countries, such control should be based upon
                                    the exercise of national sovereignty rather than on the less
                                    certain application of international law, it is hoped that the
                                    United States Government will give early consideration to the
                                    advisability of prohibiting the export of all important
                                    commodities except under licence. As a complement to such a
                                    list, and as a guide to the licencing authorities, it will no
                                    doubt be necessary for the United States to adopt also, in one
                                    form or another, a list of consignees in neutral countries who
                                    are to be regarded as undesirable recipients of American goods.
                                    For obvious reasons, which have already been recognised by all
                                    the Allies, it is desirable that both the list of prohibited
                                    exports and the lists of “suspects” should be as nearly as
                                    possible identical with those adopted by the Allied countries,
                                    and consultation and collaboration for this purpose with the
                                    Allies will, no doubt, recommend itself to the Government of the
                                    United States.</p>

                                <p>1. In instituting a system of export licences, the United States
                                    Government will doubtless wish carefully to consider the
                                    accumulated information now in possession of the Allied
                                    Governments in regard to the trade affiliations of firms in
                                    neutral countries and in regard to the quantities of goods of
                                    various classes needed by neutral countries for their own
                                    consumption. The Government of the United States is, of course,
                                    aware to how large an extent these two classes of information
                                    have been utilised, in administering the system of letters of
                                    assurance issued by the trade department of the British Embassy
                                    at Washington in the case of exports to Scandinavian countries.
                                    This system has been supplemented, in the case of exports to
                                    other neutral countries, by a carefully regulated maritime
                                    control based on the same information. The discrimination
                                    between neutral consignees, and the “rationing” of neutral
                                    countries, thus established, have now been embodied in a network
                                    of international agreements, the disturbance of which would be
                                    as unjust to various neutral interests as it would be
                                    detrimental to the interests of the Allies. There will be little
                                    difference of opinion as to the need for proper coordination
                                    between the machinery for issuing American export licences and
                                    the methods of trade control hitherto followed by His Majesty’s
                                    Government and their Allies. The extent and method of such
                                    coordination is a matter for discussion, but the United States
                                    Government <pb n="811" xml:id="pg_811" facs="0057"/>will no
                                    doubt realise how desirable it will be, from every point of
                                    view, that the licencing authority to be set up in the United
                                    States shall not conflict with the machinery now in operation,
                                    just as His Majesty’s Government most keenly realise that the
                                    continued operation of that machinery must not conflict with the
                                    sovereign powers of the United States Government.</p>

                                        shipping. The general lines on which these needs can best be
                                        satisfied have already been fully explained, but there are
                                        one or two elements of organisation which have been found
                                        necessary in every belligerent country in order to establish

                                                export and supply of American coal. This would imply
                                                the prohibition of the export of the coal except
                                                under licence, whether in the form of cargoes in
                                                bulk or in the form of bunkers. Perhaps the most
                                                convenient model for such a system is that followed
                                                by the British Government. The British organisation,
                                                as gradually built up, involves in practice, besides
                                                the prohibition of the export of coal, the setting
                                                up of a list of undesirable consignees for coal

                                                discrimination between various ships must rest upon
                                                the nature of their trade, and therefore upon the

                                <p>1. The granting or withholding of insurance in respect of
                                    transactions operating to the benefit of enemies, is a vitally
                                    important element in any control over shipping. The policy of
                                    the Allies in this respect has hitherto been much weakened by
                                    the fact that any refusal of insurance would, in many instances,
                                    merely result in transferring the insurance to American
                                    companies, several of which are associated with German concerns.
                                    It is assumed that, in pursuance of the American common law
                                    against trading with the enemy, the United States Government
                                    will intervene to prevent insurance business being done by
                                    American firms on behalf of or in the interest of the enemy. The
                                    Allies would undoubtedly welcome the closest co-operation
                                    between American insurance companies and the insurance
                                    organisations in Allied countries, and as a first step to this,
                                    it might be advisable to consider the formation of a
                                    representative and responsible committee of insurance experts in
                                    the United States who would be in touch with the corresponding
                                    responsible body here.</p>

                                <p>1. It is understood that certain amendments to the shipping bill
                                    may be introduced into Congress by the responsible
                                    administrative body which might hamper the free employment of
                                    ships built, or now building, in American ports to the best
                                    advantage of the general interests of all the countries now
                                    united in fighting the German menace. Without any desire to
                                    comment upon or to interfere with the action of the American
                                    Congress, it may be pointed out how deplorable it would be if
                                    any provisions were enacted which <pb n="813" xml:id="pg_813"
                                        facs="0059"/>would prevent the employment of any ships in
                                    the way best calculated to further Allied operations. The United
                                    States Government will no doubt see the advantage of not
                                    allowing any ships building in their ports to pass under the
                                    control of a neutral in the present very serious state of Allied
                                    tonnage. But on the other hand, it seems to be a policy of
                                    doubtful wisdom in the common interest to restrict the delivery
                                    to Allied shipowners of ships building for their order in
                                    American ports. His Majesty’s Government cannot but view with
                                    the greatest sympathy and approval, the well known efforts of
                                    the Government of the United States to increase their mercantile
                                    marine and to build up the merchant service needed to man it,
                                    for a large and efficient American merchant fleet will be of
                                    inestimable value in the difficult days of reconstruction after
                                    the war. The United States may be willing to consider whether,
                                    in reliance upon this sympathy, they would not be well advised
                                    to avoid any legislation calculated to delay the immediate
                                    putting into commission of merchant ships in United States ports
                                    during the period when the new and increased merchant service of
                                    the United States is in course of development. If His Majesty’s
                                    Government can give any assistance by providing crews or taking
                                    over vessels built in American ports for the period of the war,
                                    they would of course be glad to do so under any conditions which
                                    may be mutually agreed upon in the interests of the American
                                    mercantile marine.</p>

                                <p>The question of the world’s supplies of cereals and animal
                                    feeding stuffs is a very grave one, from the point of view both
                                    of the size of the available stocks and of the tonnage available
                                    to transport them. It seems only fair and just that the Allied
                                    countries should have first call upon those sources of supply
                                    which lie nearest to them, and, after them, those neutral
                                    countries whose tonnage is to a large extent employed in
                                    services beneficial to the Allies. Those other neutral countries
                                    which forbid or discourage their shipping from engaging in such
                                    services might in justice be required to employ the ample
                                    national tonnage which they have thus reserved for themselves,
                                    in transporting their supplies of grain and fodder from more
                                    distant markets such as the Plate, Australia or India. The
                                    advantages which the Allies would thus gain both in saving
                                    tonnage and in increased certainty of supplies cannot be
                                    exaggerated and it is suggested that, in the circumstances,
                                    there would be ample justification for a prohibition of the
                                    export of cereals and feeding stuffs from the United States to
                                    neutral destinations except under licence. The United States
                                    Government would thus be able to establish a control <pb n="814"
                                        xml:id="pg_814" facs="0060"/>over the movement of such
                                    exports in accordance with the best interests of all those who
                                    are united in the contest against Germany.</p>

                                    United States, with banks situated therein. It is suggested by
                                    the Department, however, that each banker doing business in this
                                    country should scrutinize with particular care such accounts as
                                    may be held by his bank for any resident alien enemy, and in the
                                    event any suspicious transactions occur in connection with such
                                    accounts, that they be reported immediately to the board for
                                    transmission to the proper department.</p>
                                <p>The transactions which are interesting to the State Department
                                    may be divided into three classes: <list>

                                    </list>
                                </p>
                                <p>The State Department is especially interested in preventing all
                                    transfers of money by cable, by draft, or by shipments of
                                    currency or otherwise to neutral countries in Europe for the
                                    account of alien enemies.</p>
                                <p>It is, of course, difficult for a bank to determine offhand
                                    whether or not a transfer is for the account of alien enemies,
                                    when it is asked by an individual or corporation in this country
                                    to make a transfer to a bank in a neutral country.</p>
                                <p>The board is advised, however, that the State Department is
                                    anxious that bankers throughout the country should be warned
                                    that they should scrutinize most carefully every application
                                    made to them involving the transfers of funds to neutral
                                    European countries, which transfers seem intended to give aid to
                                    the enemies of this country, either directly or indirectly.</p>
                                <p>The board is further advised that the State Department is
                                    interested in banking transactions between this country and
                                    Mexico or other Latin American countries, as there is some
                                    evidence in its possession that alien enemies operating either
                                    as individuals or through the instrumentality of an American
                                    corporation, or otherwise, are desirous of fomenting trouble
                                    between this country and other Republics of this hemisphere, and
                                    in order to further their plans they must rely upon financial
                                    assistance through the form of credits opened in their behalf in
                                    this country. It is, of course, true that many accounts held by
                                    banks in this country for the benefit of alien enemies resident
                                    in countries adjacent to the United States, are ordinary
                                    commercial accounts, and up to the present time the State
                                    Department has disclaimed any disposition to interfere with the
                                    free operation of such accounts, being interested only in such
                                    transactions as may appear to the bankers who are requested to
                                    facilitate the same as being of a suspicious character.</p>
                                <p>The board is of the opinion that, in view of your intimate
                                    contact with member banks in your district, you are in a
                                    position to secure their cooperation in scrutinizing and
                                    supervising financial transactions made or attempted to be made
                                    for the benefit of alien enemies. Reports of suspicious
                                    transactions coming to the notice of banks should be made to the
                                    board by wire, in order that the officials of the proper
                                    department may be advised and immediately make
                                    investigations.</p>
                                <p>There are, of course, many trust companies, State banks, and
                                    private bankers with which your bank has no intimate
                                    relationship. The board believes, however, that if an appeal
                                    should be made to <pb n="816" xml:id="pg_816" facs="0062"/>these
                                    banks and bankers, they would readily observe such precautionary
                                    methods as you may, with the approval of the board, ask your
                                    member banks to comply with. Express companies and telegraph
                                    companies doing a banking business in transmitting currency or
                                    credits by express or by wire should also be asked to cooperate
                                    on the lines suggested above.</p>
                                <p>The attention of the Comptroller of the Currency has been called
                                    to this letter and he has been asked to enlist the cooperation
                                    of the large force of national bank examiners working under his
                                    supervision. It is believed that their assistance will be of
                                    great value in securing the information desired and in further
                                    enlisting the cooperation of the banks with which they come in
                                    contact in their work. You are requested to urge the banking
                                    departments of the States in your district to cooperate in the
                                    same manner through their bank examiners.</p>
                                <p>It is requested by the board that a copy of this letter be sent
                                    to all banks and trust companies in your district, in order that
                                    they may understand that, while innocent transactions of a
                                    domestic character with alien enemies are unobjectionable, no
                                    business of a nature calculated to give aid or comfort to the
                                    enemy directly or indirectly will be countenanced.</p>
                                <p>Very truly yours,</p>

                                <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: As the Department is aware, the
                                French Government, in conjunction with its allies, has been active
                                since the beginning of the war in restricting the commerce of the
                                Central powers. The work in connection with this effort, which can
                                be classed under the general head of “blockade”, has been
                                apportioned at Paris between three committees, and I have the honor
                                herewith to report to you regarding the results accomplished by
                                these three committees, in so far as I have been able to learn from
                                the Foreign Office, and to transmit a considerable amount of
                                statistics and data in regard thereto.</p>
                            <p>This question, I have further treated at some length in my telegram
                                No. 2068 of to-day’s date,<note n="1" xml:id="d13fn1">Not
                                    printed.</note> but desire at this time to forward to the
                                Department the information which has been supplied me by the French
                                Government.</p>
                            <p>The three committees referred to are entitled respectively:</p>
                            <p>(1) Committee for Restricting the Provisioning and Commerce of the
                                Enemy (Comité de Restriction des approvisionnements et du commerce
                                de l’Ennemi).</p>
                            <p>(2) International Committee on “Contingents” (Commission
                                internationale des Contingents).</p>
                            <p>This word “contingents” is difficult of interpretation into English
                                as it has been adapted specially since the war in a sense previously
                                not employed. Roughly, the word may be said to represent an average
                                taken from the importations into a neutral country for several
                                years, the said average being accepted as the annual amount allowed
                                to pass into the said neutral country for each class of merchandise
                                to which the “contingent” regime is applied.</p>
                            <p>(3) Permanent International Committee of Economic Action (Comity
                                permanent international d’Action économique).</p>
                            <pb n="818" xml:id="pg_818" facs="0064"/>
                            <p>These committees are all placed under the direction of a “Minister of
                                Blockade,” who has the official title of “Under Secretary of State”
                                in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, This office is at present held
                                by Baron <persName corresp="frus1917Supp02v01#p_CD1">Denys

                                the accomplishment of the task which has been assigned him. His
                                department, which is composed of a considerable staff, centralizes
                                all economic information relative to the blockade and the economic
                                situation of the Central Empires and furnishes technical reports and
                                exhaustive documents and statistics which are of the greatest
                                importance in the conduct of the economic policy of the Allies.</p>

                                enemy origin or on the advisability of accepting certain demands
                                presented by private persons to obtain products or merchandise, the
                                importation of which is generally prohibited in view of their
                                origin.</p>
                            <p>The views of the Committee of Restriction serve as a technical basis
                                for the decisions taken by the French Administration; it is also,
                                when necessary, consulted by the commission in charge of embargo.
                                The members of this committee, who are chosen for their scientific
                                knowledge, are of French nationality, but the proceedings are
                                attended by the counselors of the Italian and Russian Embassies at
                                Paris and by a secretary of the British Embassy, representing their
                                respective Governments.</p>

                                first and last committees referred to herein. The question of
                                representation in the Committee for “Contingents” was extended to me
                                verbally by Monsieur <persName corresp="frus1917Supp02v01#p_CD1"

                            <p>As regards the practical results obtained by these committees, I am
                                led to believe that the second, that is, the one on “contingents” is
                                the most fruitful, as its activities are devoted to the important
                                task of controlling the supplies entering Switzerland. The work
                                accomplished by the first-mentioned committee is also of valuable
                                assistance to the French Government and its Allies in conducting the
                                blockade, by reason of the reports on conditions in neutral and
                                enemy countries which it places at the disposal of the various
                                Allied chanceries. The deliberations of the third committee, are
                                more academic than practical, but it has served as a medium for
                                announcing certain policies of economic procedure acceptable in
                                principle by the several Allied Governments, some of which have been
                                put into execution such as the black list.</p>

                                enormous diminution that exports of foodstuffs from the northern
                                countries to England have undergone during the years 1915–16.” The
                                facts learned from this report would seem most assuredly to point to
                                the source from which Germany has in a large part received her

                                <p>Now that the United States have joined the belligerents, it is
                                    necessary to consider the best direction their activities can
                                    take in all departments, and at what particular point their
                                    assistance can complete the work commenced by the Allies.</p>
                                <p>As far as the food and economic blockade is concerned, it would
                                    appear that, little by little, the Allied countries have taken
                                    all measures compatible with international law and political
                                    exigencies, short of coming into conflict with neutrals on
                                    military and naval grounds, so dangerous from a diplomatic point
                                    of view. The appearance on the scene of the United States will
                                    change this state of things.</p>
                                <p>With regard to Switzerland, Holland, and the Scandinavian
                                    countries, having territorial or maritime frontiers in common
                                    with the enemy, the Allies have adopted two methods of
                                    procedure:</p>

                                <p>In order not to deprive these neutrals of goods necessary to them
                                    for food and for the upkeep of their normal commercial
                                    existence, while taking precautions that such merchandise does
                                    not continue its journey to enemy territory, the Allies have
                                    founded in the various <pb n="822" xml:id="pg_822" facs="0068"
                                    />countries, societies sufficiently powerful and approved of by
                                    the local authorities, who undertake to receive consignments of
                                    goods sent to them, and to see that they are not re-exported to
                                    the enemy.</p>
                                <p>The first of these organisations was the “Netherlands Oversea
                                    Trust” in Holland, then followed “The Swiss Society of Economic
                                    Supervision,” the Danish Guilds, and many associations of
                                    Norwegian manufacturers and consumers were formed.</p>
                                <p>We may say that these societies have given perfect satisfaction,
                                    having applied themselves with energy and utility to the
                                    superintendence of the goods consigned to them. The Allies may
                                    congratulate themselves upon having resorted to this method,
                                    which safeguards the sovereign rights of neutral states and
                                    prevents friction and conflict.</p>

                                    organisations, to discourage smuggling on the part of secondhand
                                    purchasers, and to induce the governments of neutral states to
                                    see that, in the interests of the population, the prohibitions
                                    laid down by them are duly carried into effect, it was thought
                                    advisable to limit the amount of imports to that received by
                                    each neutral in time of peace, while deducting that portion they
                                    had been in the habit of re-exporting to enemy countries. This
                                    is what is called the system of rations or contingents.</p>
                                <p>In Switzerland, this policy has been somewhat strictly applied,
                                    thanks to the formation in Paris of a commission, represented by
                                    France, Great Britain, Italy and Russia. Switzerland can only
                                    receive supplies via France or Italy, and the International
                                    Commission of Contingents, informed by the customs of the two
                                    countries of all imports into Switzerland, is able to follow
                                    them day by day and to stop them as soon as they are informed
                                    that the contingent has been exhausted. As a matter of fact, the
                                    Allies have decided to revise the contingents and to reduce
                                    them, not from any mistrust of Switzerland, but on account of
                                    the ever increasing difficulties of transport, both by land and
                                    sea. This revision is now terminated.</p>
                                <p>In Holland and Scandinavia the application of the rationing
                                    system presented great difficulties. It was indeed necessary to
                                    stop goods in mid-sea, and consequently, a special right of
                                    examination and detention had to be established for the
                                    inspection of neutral merchandise under a neutral flag. These
                                    measures went against the interests of the neutral country of
                                    production and the neutral country of destination. In combining
                                    the theory of the continued voyage with the rationing policy,
                                    the English prize courts have established a law authorising the
                                    seizure of neutral merchandise under a neutral flag when it is
                                    proved that the goods are being imported in quantities so <pb
                                        n="823" xml:id="pg_823" facs="0069"/>much above the normal
                                    as to render local consumption impossible, and thus warranting
                                    the presumption that they would find their way into enemy
                                    territory.</p>
                                <p>Thanks to the measures of rationing and consignment, it has been
                                    possible to prevent the neutral countries adjoining Germany from
                                    being used for the transport, by land or sea, of goods which are
                                    under the control of the Allies.</p>
                                <p>It must, however, be borne in mind that these measures cannot be
                                    brought to bear upon the products of the soil, cattle and
                                    agricultural produce. In order to control this class of
                                    production, it would be necessary to hold up fodder, fertilizing
                                    material, and the mineral oils used for the motors of
                                    fishing-boats, all of which products, exported chiefly from the
                                    United States, undergo various changes in the country to which
                                    they are consigned, arriving finally in enemy territory in a
                                    state of complete transformation. The fact that the Allies
                                    themselves are not producers of agricultural materials and its
                                    being to the interest of Great Britain to encourage the
                                    production of such material in neutral countries, whence she
                                    draws part of her food supplies, increased the difficulty of
                                    laying down rules with regard to exports of home produce from
                                    countries such as Holland and Denmark. (This peculiar situation
                                    with its attendant unfortunate consequences, is detailed in the
                                    annexed notes.)</p>
                                <p>Though we may say with truth that the system of rationing and
                                    consignment has been thoroughly carried into effect in
                                    Switzerland, and with appreciable results, it must be admitted
                                    that Germany continues to obtain from Holland and Scandinavia
                                    supplies that are by no means negligible, and which, in fact,
                                    may be estimated roughly at 2,300,000 tons for the year 1916
                                    alone, 1,250,000 of which came from Holland, and 500,000 from
                                    Norway, i. e., enough to supply nearly the whole German Army for
                                    a year.</p>
                                <p>All reports reaching us from enemy countries point clearly to the
                                    growing scarcity of food, and in order that existing supplies
                                    may last until the next harvest, the German Imperial Government
                                    have fixed alimentary rations that are scarcely sufficient to
                                    keep non-working adults alive, and are manifestly insufficient
                                    for those that work. It is no doubt to this scarcity of food
                                    that the labour troubles in Germany are to be ascribed; the men
                                    do less work, and it is necessary to shorten the working day and
                                    considerably increase the number of hands, in order to meet the
                                    demands of war.</p>
                                <p>It may be concluded, therefore, that if Germany were obliged to
                                    forego the food supplies now coming from her neutral neighbours
                                    Holland and Denmark, she would find it impossible to maintain
                                    the industrial effort necessary to keep her armies in ammunition
                                    and explosives, and would be obliged to draw upon the stock
                                    intended for fighting men in order to supply the workmen with
                                    food. In either <pb n="824" xml:id="pg_824" facs="0070"/>case,
                                    her military force would be considerably diminished. It is also
                                    to be remembered that the prolongation of the bad weather, by
                                    delaying the harvest, increases the chances of success of a more
                                    restrictive policy; and if the Allies wish to reap the immediate
                                    benefit of their control of the seas, such policy should be
                                    carried into effect without delay.</p>
                                <p>We have enumerated above the obstacles encountered by the Allies
                                    in their attempt to isolate Germany. These obstacles can now be
                                    removed by the United States who are, as a matter of fact,
                                    producers of materials, without which Holland, Denmark and
                                    Sweden can maintain neither their agriculture nor their raising
                                    of stock. America can therefore now demand, as a belligerent,
                                    that the goods she produces shall go only to neutral consumers
                                    and, even after undergoing transformation, shall not serve to
                                    feed the enemy and maintain his powers of resistance. In laying
                                    down as a condition of the delivery of oil cakes, fertilizing
                                    and other agricultural raw material, and petroleum oils, that
                                    the importing country shall not re-export to the enemy the
                                    products of their soil, America would only be applying the
                                    generally admitted rule of international law, viz., that a
                                    belligerent is bound to prevent the production of his soil from
                                    being used for the benefit of the adversary. This principle has
                                    been recognised by the neutrals themselves, Switzerland having
                                    admitted that coal supplied to her manufacturers by Germany,
                                    could not be used in the fabrication of goods intended for the
                                    Allies, even if the other elements of the manufactured object
                                    were of neutral or Allied origin.</p>
                                <p>It will perhaps be objected that, if deprived of the fodder and
                                    manure necessary to the preservation of their cattle, the
                                    neutrals would be forced to sacrifice all their property and
                                    make it over to Germany, thus supplying her with momentary
                                    abundance. This argument need hardly be considered, however, as,
                                    by so proceeding, the neutrals would ruin their agricultural
                                    prospects and lay themselves open to famine for the following
                                    year.</p>
                                <p>One may also argue that the decrease in agricultural produce
                                    which would be the result of the cessation of American exports
                                    to neutral countries, would deprive Great Britain of the food
                                    supplies she draws from these countries. Let it be remembered
                                    above all (see notes annexed) that since the note issued by
                                    Germany of the 31st January, England, in spite of all her
                                    efforts, is far from receiving a normal amount of supplies from
                                    neutral countries, whereas the share of Germany has greatly
                                    increased. One has reason to believe, however, that owing to the
                                    influence of the United States, the neutrals will have to do
                                    without the German market and will have to resort to that of
                                    England in order to dispose profitably of their redundance. <pb
                                        n="825" xml:id="pg_825" facs="0071"/>When it is found that
                                    profit is only to be made in England, sellers and conveyors will
                                    not hesitate to take the risks of obtaining it.</p>
                                <p>It is, therefore, certainly of the most vital importance that
                                    this condition of affairs be laid before the United States
                                    Government, and that they be asked to take the necessary
                                    measures to hasten a victorious peace, which is the natural
                                    desire of all the Allies, but more especially of France who,
                                    with Belgium has had to bear the most cruel and heavy
                                    sacrifices. The Norwegian Government, moreover, has admitted to
                                    our Ambassador at Christiania the necessity and efficacity of
                                    such measures, and did not hide the fact that “the intervention
                                    of America would place the North at the mercy of the Allies.”

                                <p>Since the opening of hostilities, the various belligerents have
                                    drawn up lists of prohibited exports, some of which, if
                                    considered of vital necessity to a given country, are authorised
                                    by way of exceptions, which are freely accorded, but under
                                    strict guarantee of their non-reexportation into enemy
                                    territory. The required guarantees are of two kinds: <list>
                                        <label>1.</label>
                                        <item>Consignment to a society formed in the neutral country
                                            of import, entrusted with the superintendence of the
                                            quantities consumed.</item>
                                        <label>2.</label>
                                        <item>The classification in so called “black lists” of
                                            suspected firms, to whom all shipments are
                                            refused.</item>
                                    </list>
                                </p>
                                <p>It is evident, however, that neither of these measures are in
                                    themselves sufficient, as it is impossible for the local society
                                    to control the merchandise throughout all phases of transaction,
                                    and a black list is never sufficiently complete. A suspected
                                    firm can always make use of an agent or man of straw, who acts
                                    for them, and is only discovered after the harm is done.</p>
                                <p>It follows, therefore, that the list of prohibitions should be
                                    very comprehensive, and very strictly applied.</p>

                                    the obligation to receive certain consignments for local
                                    consumption, under guarantee of non-reexportation to the enemy,
                                    such guarantee to apply to the imported product in its original,
                                    or any modified form whatsoever.</p>
                                <p>An agreement has been made between France, England, and Sweden
                                    which, if ratified, would take off the embargo which is now laid
                                    on all goods destined to Sweden.</p>

                                <p>The British Government, with the assent of the Allies, applies
                                    the rationing system to neutral countries bordering on Germany
                                    in “law” or in “fact”.</p>
                                <p>The system is said to be applied in “law”, when an agreement is
                                    made with the government or with a society of the neutral
                                    country, by which a maximum ration is fixed to cover a given
                                    period of time. If it is then proved by experience that the
                                    amount is too large, fresh arrangements are made with a view to
                                    its diminution, and, as a matter of fact, a general revision has
                                    just taken place in a restrictive sense with regard to
                                    consignments to Switzerland, and the same measures will shortly
                                    be adopted for Holland and Denmark.</p>
                                <pb n="827" xml:id="pg_827" facs="0073"/>
                                <p>The rationing system is applied “in fact” to all products
                                    (excepting in case of special arrangement) which are proved by
                                    British naval statistics to be entering a neutral country in
                                    quantities considerably greater than those imported before the
                                    war, exclusive of the amount re-exported.</p>
                                <p>The system is however inadequate, as all boats are not subject to
                                    compulsory inspection by cruisers, and the prices offered by
                                    Germany for commodities she lacks being high enough to encourage
                                    neutrals to keep only what is absolutely necessary for their own
                                    use.</p>

                                <p>The attention of the United States Government has already been
                                    called to the necessity of the establishment of “black lists”.
                                    They are of two kinds: official lists published in the <hi
                                        rend="italic">Journal Officiel</hi>, and confidential lists,
                                    which are submitted to governments only.</p>
                                <p>The French and British Governments have drawn up these lists in
                                    mutual agreement, and those appearing in the <hi rend="italic"
                                        >Journal Officiel</hi> are, with few exceptions, identical
                                    with the English statutory lists. At the outset, the English and
                                    French confidential lists differed widely, but gradually became
                                    more and more alike. The French Government included on their
                                    confidential fist, for the countries of Northern Europe, all
                                    those firms appearing on the English general black list, to whom
                                    they strictly prohibited shipments to be made.</p>
                                <p>With regard to Switzerland, the British and Italian Governments
                                    apply the French confidential black list, which is communicated
                                    to the delegate of the “Société Suisse de Surveillance
                                    Economique” in Paris, and no permit is accorded by the
                                    “Commission des Dérogations” to firms appearing thereon. Goods
                                    addressed to any such firm and consigned to the “S. S. S.” are
                                    stopped at the frontier by the custom or other competent
                                    authorities.</p>
                                <p>It would appear infinitely desirable that the U. S. Government
                                    accept the French black lists at once, forbidding all exports of
                                    any kind whatever to the firms included thereon.</p>
                                <p>As far as South America is concerned, the French Government
                                    confine themselves to the use of the list appearing in the <hi
                                        rend="italic">Journal Officiel.</hi>
                                </p>

                                <p>If the United States Government do not decide simply to put a
                                    stop to all shipments to Northern Europe, it would appear
                                    absolutely necessary that they make a declaration to the effect
                                    that no goods sent to them from America be re-exported to the
                                    Central Empires, under any form whatsoever. It would merely be a
                                    matter of putting into rigorous practice the following clause of
                                    article 5 of the agreement made by France on the 7th December,
                                    with the “Netherlands Oversea Trust.”</p>

                                    Norway.)</p>
                                <p>Consequently, it would be well to simply declare that no raw
                                    material will be authorised to enter the country, if intended
                                    for the fattening of cattle, or for the production of crops to
                                    be re-exported to Germany.</p>
                                <p>Local produce similar to goods imported by the Allies, but in no
                                    way connected with or dependent upon them, would come under the
                                    same régime. It was stipulated in the agreement made at The
                                    Hague between the French Legation and the “Netherlands Oversea
                                    Trust,” that no export permit would be granted, either directly
                                    or indirectly, for goods existing or produced in the country,
                                    similar to those consigned by sea to the trust. In case of
                                    violation of this rule, the trust would be no longer allowed to
                                    receive consignments of foreign products similar to the locally
                                    produced goods exported. All substitutes for meat would be
                                    prohibited to enter Holland, if the Dutch Government had
                                    authorised the export of cattle or meat into Germany.</p>
                                <p>The rigorous application of these two rules would undoubtedly
                                    result in a more effective blockade than that at present in
                                    force.</p>

                            <p>The attached notes give roughly the general position of the various
                                neutral European countries as regards trade with the Allies and with
                                the enemy, and as regards shipping. It will be seen that pressure of
                                the strongest kind is suggested in the case of Sweden and Spain, <pb
                                    n="829" xml:id="pg_829" facs="0075"/>very definite pressure in
                                the case of Norway, and pressure of a highly flexible and judicious
                                character in the case of Denmark and Holland. It is obvious that
                                flexible pressure, no less than very strong pressure, calls for the
                                widest discretionary powers in the Government which attempts to
                                exert it, and the whole diplomatic situation towards neutral Europe
                                will, it is submitted, require the exercise by the United States
                                Government of comprehensive powers of embargo on exports.</p>
                            <p>The figures given in the attached notes are highly confidential,
                                since they have in large part been obtained from sources which would
                                be closed were it to become known that the statistics were in the
                                possession of the Allies. They should therefore on no account be
                                used in discussions with the Governments concerned.</p>
                            <p>The seriousness of the present position arises from the fact that the
                                shipping crisis is working with ever increasing force to the
                                detriment of the Allies who depend on sea-borne supplies from
                                neutral countries, and to the advantage of Germany who is in a
                                position to receive neutral supplies across land frontiers.</p>

                                    be mentioned the latter’s recent refusal to allow the transit of
                                    bags from Great Britain to Russia, thus making it impossible to

                                    is now being applied to Sweden by the Allies, by holding up
                                    shipments to Sweden, and one of the objects aimed at by this
                                    pressure is to force the Swedish Government to ratify the
                                    January draft agreement. This agreement provides for the setting
                                    up in Sweden, with the recognition of the Government, of trade
                                    associations which can control goods imported and prevent their
                                    re-export to Germany. It also provides for an elaborate system
                                    of exchange between British exports to Sweden on the one hand
                                    and Swedish exports to Great Britain plus goods transited to
                                    Russia on the other hand. It also provides for the fixing of
                                    rations on a large number of articles imported into Sweden.</p>

                                <p>It is suggested that the United States should prohibit the export
                                    of all articles to Sweden and require from the Swedish
                                    Government compensation in the form of transit to Russia for all
                                    quantities of American products licensed for export, such
                                    compensation to be expressly in addition to the compensation
                                    guaranteed by the Swedish Government in the draft agreement with
                                    the British Government, which the Swedish Government should be
                                    called upon to ratify without delay as a part of the proposed
                                    bargain with the United States. The precise terms of any such
                                    bargain should, so far as <pb n="832" xml:id="pg_832"

                                    Transits Committee on which the United States Government have
                                    already been invited to appoint a representative, but the main
                                    object of any such bargain, on which it is possible to insist
                                    without further examination of details, is that the Swedish
                                    Government should increase the amount of transit guaranteed
                                    under the draft agreement with Great Britain, i. e., 3,000 tons
                                    a week, winter and summer, via Haparanda and an additional
                                    quantity of not less than 3,000 tons a week by other lines when
                                    the ports of the Gulf of Bothnia are open.</p>
                                <p>Besides this general bargain, it is suggested that the United
                                    States might impose the further conditions in respect of

                                <p>The attitude of the Swedish Government being a constant source of
                                    anxiety to the Allies, and that attitude constantly taking on
                                    new forms detrimental to the Allies, there will probably be new
                                    occasions for pressure as the war proceeds, but the above
                                    suggestions seem to be the most urgent at this moment. It is not
                                    considered probable that the Allies have now anything to fear in
                                    the way of actual warlike action by Sweden but she will
                                    doubtless always threaten to cut off essential supplies from
                                    them and in any negotiations care will have to be taken to
                                    prevent any such development.</p>
                                <p>In addition, detailed suggestions will shortly be made as to the
                                    best means of forcing Swedish shipping into employment. For the
                                    present, it is suggested that the Swedish Government might at
                                    least be informed that Sweden can not, in the existing shortage
                                    of world supplies, be given the advantage of the near market of
                                    the United States unless a proper proportion of her shipping is
                                    employed in the general service of the world’s commerce.</p>

                                    here that the attitude of the present Spanish Government appears
                                    to render advisable the very strongest pressure through the
                                    prohibition of exports from the United States, if a continued
                                    flow of essential supplies from Spain to the Allies is to [be]

                                    coal, the United States is believed to control other important
                                    supplies upon which Spain is dependent, such as cotton and
                                    cottonseed oil.</p>
                                <p>It is, moreover, important that all exports of oil to Spain
                                    should be carefully controlled, since Spain has for long been a
                                    notorious base for German submarines. Great Britain needs iron
                                    ore from Spain for munitions.</p>

                                <p>Norway, like other neutral countries, fears attack from Germany.
                                    Her policy has been to temporize and hope for the best. She
                                    exports milk, fish and other important articles to the United
                                    Kingdom and in the event of severe controversy with the Allies
                                    she might cut these off. At present, however, it is not thought
                                    likely either that Germany will attack Norway or that Norway
                                    will cut off supplies to the United Kingdom. Caution is however
                                    necessary. As a first step it is suggested that the United
                                    States might make any further export of copper or copper goods
                                    to Norway conditional on an absolute assurance that no further
                                    pyrites will be shipped to Germany so long as the war lasts, and
                                    might use her control over Norwegian supplies of cereals,
                                    feeding stuffs, oil, meat and leather to stop or at least reduce
                                    Norwegian exports to Germany, especially as regards nickel,
                                    carbide, fish and the other articles under 1 (<hi rend="italic"

                                <p>Some Danish ships are still lying idle in Scandinavian ports, but
                                    a regular service of produce boats is being kept running to the
                                    United Kingdom, while some vessels are fulfilling their charters
                                    in Allied interests and others are allowed to come to the United

                                    traffic with overseas countries has also been resumed.
                                    Meanwhile, with the consent of the owners, the British

                                    to requisition others, but further requisitions are for the

                                <p>British policy with regard to Denmark has been controlled by
                                    three considerations—first, the helplessness of Denmark against
                                    any attack by Germany; secondly, the desirability of not forcing
                                    a largely increased slaughtering of cattle and pigs and their
                                    export to Germany by a too drastic reduction of fodder imports;
                                    and thirdly, the necessity of maintaining the flow of Danish
                                    supplies to the United Kingdom, which is at present carried on
                                    under an agreement between the Danish and German Governments
                                    whereby the latter undertake to respect Danish produce boats to
                                    the United Kingdom, at least as far on their voyage as Norway
                                    and possibly for the whole voyage. Denmark exported 82,000 tons
                                    of bacon to the United Kingdom in 1916.</p>
                                <p>For the present, therefore, it is suggested that the United
                                    States might confine itself to prohibiting the export of fodder
                                    to Denmark and informing the Danish Government that licenses
                                    will only be <pb n="836" xml:id="pg_836" facs="0082"/>granted if
                                    Denmark will continue to supply the United Kingdom with bacon at
                                    pre-war percentage rates and curtail exports of cattle and beef
                                    to Germany at least to pre-war figures. Unless and until Denmark
                                    accepts these terms, it is suggested that licenses for exports
                                    of fodder should not be issued and perhaps also that other
                                    exports to Denmark should be curtailed, since any such
                                    curtailment will set free Danish tonnage for requisition by the
                                    British Government. Pressure along these lines can probably be
                                    continued through the summer, though the pressure would have to
                                    be relaxed if Danish slaughtering began seriously to increase or
                                    exports to the United Kingdom seriously to diminish.</p>
                                <p>This pressure would be much increased in effectiveness if it were
                                    reinforced by a threat to cut off oil supplies from the United
                                    States.</p>

                                    should be made the subject of consultation with that committee
                                    at Paris, and that American representatives should be attached
                                    to it for that purpose.</p>
                                <p>There is, however, one point on which the assistance of the
                                    United States Government would be welcome at once. In the third
                                    quarter of 1916 the Swiss exports of animals to enemy countries

                                <p>The position with regard to each neutral country has been dealt
                                    with in separate memoranda.</p>

                                    for the future, by the British Government in order to meet these
                                    two problems and to induce neutral tonnage to render reasonable
                                    services to the Allies. If the United States decide to
                                    co-operate in these measures, their effectiveness will be
                                    greatly increased, since the Allies will be in control of
                                    practically the whole coal supplies of the world and any
                                    conditions, short of compelling the neutral shipowner to run his

                                        each case that the ship, when repaired, or an equivalent
                                        ship, shall be chartered to the Inter-Allied

                                        Inter-Allied Chartering Executive, and it would be desirable

                                        shipowners on whom American coal pressure has been

                                    <item>Besides the above terms, the British Government requires
                                        neutral vessels, in return for bunkers, to call for
                                        examination at British ports when proceeding to European
                                        countries contiguous to enemy countries and it is proposed
                                        to strengthen this by requiring that they shall not carry
                                        any cargo which has not been definitely approved by the
                                        appropriate Allied authority. The object of this additional
                                        requirement will be the elimination of the delays involved
                                        in the examination of neutral ships and the quicker and
                                        fuller use of the tonnage available. Further in order to
                                        prevent the supply of coal, oil, etc., to enemy commerce
                                        raiders, etc., Great Britain requires that all shipments of
                                        coal and oil shall be approved by the British Minister in
                                        the port of destination. This prevents cargoes which might
                                        be destined for a raider or submarine being sent out to a
                                        dummy consignee or even to a real consignee who is
                                        unreliable. Vessels whose owners have complied with these

                                        reasonable service for the Allies.</item>

                                        subtractions from that list will be considered jointly by

                                    <item>There is further a black list of ships which consists of
                                        ships believed to be enemy owned or controlled or belonging
                                        to owners who have broken the undertaking to abide by the

                                        from the black list by being chartered to the Inter-Allied

                                <p>The problem of the owners who prefer to lay their ship up rather
                                    than perform any service for the Allies is a more difficult one,
                                    and would have to be met by direct pressure upon the neutral
                                    countries concerned by refusal of supplies.</p>
                                <p>In view of the military and economic factors involved, the case
                                    of each country has to be considered separately. The first step,
                                    however, must be the adoption of such a measure of common policy
                                    between the Allies as will prevent neutral countries from
                                    playing one Ally off against another. Spain, for instance, is
                                    under obligation to supply iron ore to Great Britain in return
                                    for coal, and it would be highly detrimental to Allied interests
                                    if she were enabled to escape from this obligation by obtaining
                                    supplies of American coal.</p>
                                <p>Another method of preventing the laying up of tonnage is that
                                    adopted by Great Britain in regard to Denmark, viz., requisition
                                    of the tonnage in Allied ports. This power of requisition is
                                    exercised by collusion with the neutral owners, but even in the
                                    absence of the owner’s consent there appears to be no reason why
                                    the exercise of the power should not be justified by the law of
                                    angary.</p>
                                <p>It is, of course, understood that all tonnage building in Allied
                                    ports for neutral flags has been and is requisitioned and put
                                    into Allied service, except in the case of ships sold or
                                    time-chartered to an approved Allied firm.</p>

                                            Similar control is exercised in French and Italian ports

                                            means of the undertaking given by every importer of

                                <p>In this way a very substantial control is obtained. It is not
                                    very effective in Holland where German coal is available, and
                                    recently certain firms in other countries have shown an
                                    inclination to evade the control by using American coal.</p>

                                <p>Hitherto the policy adopted has been only to impose upon neutral
                                    shipowners conditions which they will recognise as reasonable
                                    and are such as to give the shipowner every opportunity of
                                    engaging in lucrative trade, so that he is not led either by
                                    indignation or by commercial considerations to attempt to evade
                                    the bunker control by using American coal. A copy of these
                                    conditions is attached, (A). This policy has on the whole been
                                    successful. Now, however, that the United States Government are
                                    proposing to control American coal, it is possible to impose
                                    much more stringent conditions upon the supply of bunkers for
                                    neutral ships. A draft of the proposed new conditions is
                                    attached, (B). These conditions besides securing the original
                                    objects of the bunker control, namely, preventing supplies
                                    reaching enemy countries, and preventing neutral ships being
                                    used as supply ships for enemy warships, definitely require that
                                    a satisfactory proportion of neutral tonnage should be employed
                                    in essential Allied trades. It is desirable that as the United
                                    States and Great Britain practically control all the available
                                    coal in the world, the two Governments should adopt the same
                                    policy in regard to the supply of bunkers. It is, however,
                                    essential for administrative reasons that there should be only
                                    one central authority.</p>

                                <p>It will be seen that the above control is based, primarily, upon
                                    the ships white list. It is clearly desirable that there should
                                    only be one ships white list applicable both to American coal
                                    and British coal. Hitherto the list has been compiled by the
                                    British Admiralty under the instructions of a committee in
                                    London on which the Foreign Office, Board of Trade and Admiralty
                                    are represented. This committee is largely guided by the advice

                                    the conditions of supply of a specific requirement that the
                                    shipowner shall employ a satisfactory proportion of his ships in
                                    essential Allied trades will involve a series of negotiations
                                    with individual shipowners. It will further involve the
                                    consideration of the amount of neutral tonnage which may be
                                    found essential for various United States trades. It seems
                                    desirable, therefore, that the compilation of the ships white
                                    list should remain as heretofore in the hands of the Bunker
                                    Committee in London, but that the United States Government
                                    should appoint some representative in London either to attend
                                    the meetings of the Bunker Committee regularly—which scarcely
                                    seems necessary, as a good deal of the work is purely routine
                                    work—or to be available for consultation with the committee when
                                    any question affecting United States trade arises.</p>

                            <p>This report is based on the assumption that a law will be enacted
                                applying to insular possessions of the United States as well as to
                                continental United States, and including not only exportations of
                                articles in commerce but the carrying out of United States ports of
                                coal, fuel oil or other ships’ stores. The question is whether the
                                United States Government would, under the provisions of such an act,
                                be empowered to accomplish the same objects as are accomplished by
                                the Allies by their rationing of neutral countries, letters of
                                assurance, bunker control, and black lists, and if the same objects
                                can be substantially so attained, then what administrative procedure
                                and machinery are necessary for this purpose. The law should
                                prohibit and penalize the carrying out of the United States or its
                                possessions of any article proclaimed by the President except by
                                license and under rules and regulations issued by him.</p>

                            <p>A “ration” is the amount of any commodity imported or permitted to be
                                imported by a neutral country of Europe. The determination of the
                                amount of the “ration” in general depends upon an estimate of the
                                domestic needs of the neutral country, and this estimate is usually
                                made in agreement with the importing interests in the neutral
                                country concerned, such for instance as the Dutch N. O. T., Danish
                                Merchants’ Guild, and various Norwegian associations, who agree not
                                to import quantities in excess of the ration fixed. In some cases
                                these agreements are made with the neutral government itself. In
                                fixing the “ration” the aim of the Allied Governments has been— <list>

                            <p>It is understood that whereas in the past, in view of the fact that
                                the enforcement of the “rationing.” was of necessity based upon
                                maritime international law and not on sovereignty, the Allied
                                Governments have not felt able to introduce as a factor in fixing
                                “rations” the idea of putting pressure upon neutral countries to
                                render services in the form of shipping or otherwise, and have been
                                obliged to take into account the necessity of reaching an agreement
                                with the neutral countries in each case as to the amount of the
                                ration, it will now be possible, should the Government of the United
                                States so desire, to fix rations without obtaining the consent of
                                the neutral countries and to reinforce the rationing system by
                                requiring that, in exchange for exports from the United States, the
                                neutral countries should perform certain services such as employing
                                a reasonable percentage of their shipping in certain trades. Whether
                                or not this is to be done is a question of policy which the
                                sub-committee is not competent to decide.</p>
                            <p>The sub-committee has had submitted to it the confidential figures in
                                the possession of the British mission as to the imports and exports
                                of neutral countries. We understand that the Secretary of State and
                                Mr. <persName corresp="frus1917Supp02v01#p_BAJ1">Balfour</persName>
                                were anxious to know whether on a purely statistical basis new
                                rations could be worked out for certain neutral countries which
                                would prevent them from exporting their own produce to enemy
                                countries. Such calculations could hardly be made in Washington with
                                the statistics available here, and, so far as immediate questions of
                                policy are concerned the sub-committee feel that they should point
                                out that there can, in the nature of things, be no scientific
                                accuracy in any estimate of the effect upon neutral exports to
                                Germany, of a reduction of overseas imports into the neutral country
                                concerned.</p>
                            <pb n="848" xml:id="pg_848" facs="0094"/>
                            <p>For instance, the imports of fodder into Denmark in the period July
                                to December, 1916, were only 394,319 tons, as against an average
                                import less all exports for six months during 1911–13 of 459,225.
                                Yet, during the third and fourth quarters of 1916, Germany took 15
                                per cent and 24 per cent of Danish exports, respectively, as against
                                an average of 3 per cent before the war, Danish exports to the
                                United Kingdom being correspondingly reduced. Moreover, while
                                Denmark before the war exported about 5,000 head of cattle a week to
                                Germany (live and slaughtered), she is now exporting over 7,000 head
                                a week.</p>
                            <p>That is to say that while the fixing of a ration for a neutral
                                country can attain the object mentioned under (1) above, i. e., it
                                can satisfy the home requirements of the neutral country and while
                                it can, to a certain extent, at least attain the object mentioned
                                under (2), i. e., it can maintain exports from such neutral country
                                of imported or native products to the Allies, it cannot of itself
                                prevent all exports to enemy countries whether of imported or native
                                products, i. e., the object mentioned under (3).</p>
                            <p>In order to attain this last object there must be a definite
                                diplomatic agreement with the government of the neutral country
                                concerned that it will prevent such exports, since without such an
                                agreement, however low the ration of imported goods may be, the
                                native products will inevitably seek the market where they can find
                                the highest prices and that market will, under the present
                                circumstances, always be Germany. In order to reach such an
                                agreement the first thing that has to be done is to restrict exports
                                to the neutral country for bargaining purposes and such restrictions
                                must be made on diplomatic rather than on statistical grounds.</p>
                            <p>In so far as a permanent and standing modification of existing
                                rations on a statistical basis is now called for, the new rations
                                should, we feel, be worked out by the Rationing Committee and the
                                War Trade Statistical Department in London with the collaboration of
                                an American representative, rather than by any committees in
                                Washington, since these bodies in London have been working at the
                                complicated statistics involved for many months and there is no
                                English representative in Washington with sufficient statistical
                                knowledge to undertake a re-examination of each individual ration.
                                It is believed that the American representative should be appointed
                                as soon as possible to collaborate with these bodies in London.</p>
                            <p>Until the new rations are determined upon, the United States
                                Government (1) may use the present rations as one factor in
                                determining the issuance of export licenses and (2) may
                                independently use its control to cut off any part, or the whole, of
                                any existing ration as a means of pressure upon neutral countries to
                                enter into agreements. Whether these courses will be followed or not
                                by the United States, the <pb n="849" xml:id="pg_849" facs="0095"
                                />sub-committee believes that the control of exports provided for in
                                the proposed legislation will confer upon the United States
                                Government full power to do so.</p>

                                <hi rend="smallcaps">II. Letters of Assurance</hi>
                            </p>
                            <p>Hitherto, the only control over exports from the United States has
                                been carried out by the system of letters of assurance issued by the
                                British Embassy in the case of shipments to Norway, Sweden and
                                Denmark. These letters of assurance represent simply a statement
                                made to such American exporters as may apply to the British Embassy
                                that so far as the British Government is aware, and subject to new
                                facts coming to their knowledge subsequent to the issue of the
                                letter, there is no objection to the shipment of the articles
                                through the British naval patrols. Consequently, a letter of
                                assurance is not a license but simply a facility and operates as a
                                pass attached to the goods for the information of the examining
                                officer at the British port of call, or the British naval
                                patrol.</p>
                            <p>In order that such a pass may be as certain and effective as possible
                                applications for letters of assurance are referred by the British
                                Embassy to London by telegraph in all cases where the character of
                                the consignee or the amount of the shipment raises any doubt as to
                                its ultimate destination. The letter of assurance thus merely aims
                                at assuring the exporter a maximum of certainty that the goods will
                                reach their destination without difficulty and with the minimum
                                amount of delay in examination.</p>
                            <p>Under the pending legislation, the President will have authority to
                                do all and more than is accomplished by letters of assurance. It is,
                                however, uncertain at present to how large a range of commodities
                                that authority will in practice be applied.</p>
                            <p>In the case of commodities against which no prohibition of export has
                                been imposed it may be necessary for the British system of letters
                                of assurance to be continued. In case the prohibition of
                                exportations from the United States is complete, the question is
                                whether American licenses should supersede or accompany British
                                letters of assurance. How this matter may be arranged in the
                                interest of the greatest economy and efficiency may be left to the
                                two Governments concerned.</p>

                                commonly known as “bunker conditions.” Originally the “bunker
                                conditions” enacted by the British Government were directed to two
                                main objects: first, the facilitation of the blockade by requiring
                                neutral ships to call at British ports for examination, etc., and
                                second, the prevention of supply for commerce raiders by preventing
                                the carrying of coal, oil, or supplies except to approved
                                consignees. Another provision was directed against the
                                transportation of enemy reservists. To these original conditions
                                have gradually been added other stipulations, of which the most
                                important is the requirement that ships shall do a certain amount of
                                service beneficial to the Allies, such, for instance, as the
                                carrying of coal from the United Kingdom to the Atlantic islands, i.
                                e., Cape Verde (St. Vincent), and Canary Islands (Las Palmas),
                                etc.</p>
                            <p>Now that the shipping situation has grown so much worse this last
                                object has become by far the most important and it will be essential
                                to reinforce the “bunker conditions” by requiring all neutral
                                shipowners to perform a fuller measure of service to the Allies in
                                return for the supply of British and American coal and also, as a
                                subsidiary measure, in the direction of requiring neutral ships to
                                take only approved cargoes so as to reduce to a minimum the delay
                                caused by examination in British ports. A memorandum by the British
                                mission on the whole question is attached hereto.<note n="1"

                            </p>
                            <p>The British mission recommends that the licensing of the export of
                                coal from the United States should be on the basis of a list of
                                approved consignees in neutral countries and that no licenses should
                                be issued for any export except to firms on this “white” list. If
                                this procedure is adopted by the United States licensing
                                authorities, it will be desirable that all the Allies should so far
                                as possible work on an identical list of approved coal consignees.
                                The British Government is at present working on the basis of a
                                comprehensive list known as the “Regular and Reliable List of Coal
                                Importers in Neutral Countries” the firms on which have entered into
                                the agreements mentioned under (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) above, and
                                have been reported as trustworthy by H. M. representative in the
                                country concerned.</p>
                            <p>As regards the bunkering of ships in United States ports, it is
                                recommended that power should be taken to control the supply to
                                ships of coal, oil fuel, or ships’ stores. The various possible
                                methods of exercising this control are dealtwith in the attached
                                memorandum of the British mission.</p>
                            <p>The sub-committee believe that the proposed legislation in Congress,
                                will empower the President to obtain by licensing ships’ supplies
                                all of the objects attained by the British bunker control. It is
                                essential <pb n="851" xml:id="pg_851" facs="0097"/>that it should
                                apply to bunkers and other supplies shipped for use on board rather
                                than as cargo for trade.</p>

                            </p>
                            <p>The “statutory list” is the list of persons or firms of enemy
                                nationality and association proclaimed by the British Government
                                under the Trading with the Enemy (Extension of Powers) Act, 1915.
                                British subjects are in every case prohibited by this act from
                                trading with these firms, and therefore no application for exporting
                                to them can, in the nature of things, even be received by the
                                British licensing authorities. The same applies to the French
                                official black list. The “confidential black list” in Great Britain
                                is not published and is not compiled under statutory authority, but
                                is simply a confidential guide used by the licensing authorities as
                                a record of undesirable consignees in neutral countries; that is,
                                consignees whom experience has shown to be acting as channels for
                                the passage of goods or money through neutral countries to the
                                enemy. This list in Great Britain is purely an administrative list
                                for the purpose of the execution of the various acts and orders in
                                council prohibiting exports. The British Government does not
                                necessarily refuse all applications for all goods to all the firms
                                on their confidential black list. There is a subdivision of that
                                black list which is composed of firms against whom there are merely
                                suspicions more or less serious. The placing of a firm on this
                                subdivision of the list is merely a precautionary measure and is
                                especially used as a guide to the customs in exercising their right
                                of challenge.</p>
                            <p>In regard to the question whether the export licensing system to be
                                set up under the export restriction bill will fulfill the objects
                                intended by the Allied black lists, it must first of all be pointed
                                out that if the export licensing system is of itself to act as a
                                complete bar to trade with any given firm in a neutral country, it
                                would be necessary to prohibit the export except under license of
                                all commodities whatsoever.</p>
                            <p>The United States will find itself in the same difficulty with both
                                Great Britain and France as confronted Great Britain with respect to
                                France before the enactment of the British Enemy Trade Extension
                                Act, 1915, unless the United States is at least prepared to regard
                                the British statutory list and the French official black list as
                                lists of persons to whom it is undesirable to issue export licenses.
                                The “confidential black list” would also, in practice, have to be
                                used as a determining guide in the licensing of American exports. A
                                conflict in the matter of the restriction of exports from the United
                                States as between the United States and France or Great Britain
                                would seem to be a fruitful cause for dissatisfaction on the part of
                                the citizens of both countries. If the exporters in the United
                                States are permitted <pb n="852" xml:id="pg_852" facs="0098"/>to
                                ship goods to persons who are not permitted to receive goods from
                                Great Britain, there will be much cause for dissatisfaction on the
                                part of the shippers in Great Britain. The same would be true if the
                                cases were reversed. If, however, the character of the consignee
                                could be agreed upon by the War Trade Intelligence Department in
                                London and the representatives of the United States Government
                                there, to whom all the evidence would be available, such
                                difficulties would be avoided.</p>
                            <p>The British members of the sub-committee point out that so far as
                                exports to firms of enemy nationality or association are concerned,
                                the licensing system may adequately meet the situation, but they
                                emphasize the fact already mentioned above that this is conditional
                                upon the prohibition of all exports whatsoever except under license
                                and it is hardly possible that such comprehensive prohibition will
                                be issued at first. Moreover, the British experience has been that
                                the control over exports by licensing is apt not to be totally
                                effective in administrative practice as a complete barrier to trade
                                unless reinforced by legal penalties, because it is hardly possible
                                in all cases to prevent the goods passing out of the hands of the
                                original consignee into the hands of parties who may be entirely
                                willing to use the goods for the benefit of our enemies. The black
                                list accomplishes this object by advertising all the concerns which
                                have been found to be for one reason or another undesirable to Great
                                Britain. The original consignee, therefore, and any subsequent
                                persons to whom the goods are later transferred are warned not to
                                deal with persons whose names appear on the black list, under pain
                                of statutory and other penalties.</p>
                            <p>The British members further point out that, so far as imports from
                                firms of enemy nationality or association are concerned, the
                                licensing system as to exports will not prevent such firms from
                                selling goods to the United States and obtaining from the United
                                States either a remittance of funds or a credit in the United States
                                in payment of such goods. That is to say, a firm whose activities
                                are regarded as being so much in the enemy interest that goods
                                cannot be licensed for exportation from the United States to it will
                                be allowed to receive for its imports into the United States money
                                and credit, which are much more fluid and can much more easily be
                                transferred to any enemy country itself. Moreover, enemy money or
                                credits have been and will almost certainly continue to be used both
                                for conducting German propaganda and intrigue and also for buying
                                stocks of material urgently needed by the United States and the
                                Allies for military purposes and it may be expected that one of the
                                main activities of the enemy in South America will consist in
                                cornering so far as possible, South American supplies upon which, in
                                the present situation, the United States must depend to a peculiar
                                degree.</p>
                            <pb n="853" xml:id="pg_853" facs="0099"/>
                            <p>The British members strongly put forward the view that in remote
                                neutral countries, no less than in countries contiguous to enemy
                                countries, the policy of prohibiting all dealings with enemy firms
                                is of the most direct belligerent value and tends to shorten the
                                war. They have explained that this has been the great object of the
                                British statutory list, that the gradual destruction of
                                long-established organizations providing channels for German trade
                                abroad works powerfully on the German mind against a prolongation of
                                war and that in the contrary case the knowledge that overseas
                                connections are being maintained and that credits are being built up
                                and stocks of raw materials accumulated for post-war shipment is a
                                very substantial asset for the enemy in continuing the war. In
                                short, they point out that every argument commonly used to support
                                the theory that a trade war during peace is an incentive to war
                                emphasizes the conclusion that trade war during the war is an
                                incentive to peace. They would therefore strongly urge that adequate
                                measures should be taken to deal with the situation.</p>
                            <p>In regard to the above observations it may be pointed out that in so
                                far as the remittance of funds or the creation of credits in respect
                                of imports into the United States is concerned the objects effected
                                by the British statutory-list policy might, under pending or
                                proposed legislation, be in large measure if not entirely
                                accomplished in the following ways: <list>

                                        transfers of money, if a strict postal as well as wireless
                                        censorship is established in the United States and is
                                        exercised for such objects.</item>

                                    <item>The Enemy Trading Act, as drafted, will prevent any

                                        benefit of, or in behalf of, persons in Germany or persons
                                        in neutral countries doing business in Germany, or German
                                        agents in neutral countries or, by proclamation of the
                                        President, natives or subjects of Germany in neutral
                                        countries. The Enemy Trading Act is drafted to include also
                                        the allies of Germany. Under the powers given by the act it
                                        will presumably be possible to set up a control of banking
                                        accounts, etc., which besides reinforcing the control of
                                        transfers by the censorship might, to a certain extent at
                                        least, operate to block and prevent the utilization of
                                        credits established in the United States in respect of goods
                                        imported.</item>

                            </p>
                            <p>The doubt, however, is how far any censorship control or any control
                                over banking accounts, etc., could operate against monetary
                                transactions with firms in neutral countries with whom transactions
                                in goods are <hi rend="italic">ex hypothesi</hi> not entirely
                                prohibited. The question, therefore, comes down to the problem how
                                far the Enemy Trading Act, as drafted, would give enemy character to
                                persons in neutral countries who are natives of that country but not
                                agents of the Government of Germany or an ally of Germany, and who

                                to be actively assisting Germany in such ways as propaganda and

                                presupposes a central authority in the United States that would

                                countries. The amounts of exports from the United States will be

                            <p>Great Britain has already worked out an elaborate organization known
                                as the War Trade Intelligence Department for determining facts of
                                this character. They know, for example, that if goods are consigned
                                to certain consignees, those goods or the products thereof will be
                                ultimately in the hands of our enemies. It will be almost impossible
                                to duplicate the machinery already in existence and it would seem to
                                be a waste of time and effort to do so. It would seem, therefore,
                                that the consignees for exports from the United States should be
                                agreed upon with the Government of Great Britain, before being
                                approved by the United States Government.</p>

                                    between and supervision over consignees to which the coal
                                    available for the particular country is exported.</p>
                                <p>Originally the licensing authority in Great Britain contented
                                    itself with refusing licenses to firms of known enemy activity
                                    or connection (i. e., the policy of a black list). It was soon
                                    found, however, that this control was not nearly sufficient, as
                                    all that an importer on the “black list” had to do was to apply
                                    for a license in the name of a “dummy” consignee. Cases occurred
                                    in which British coal was actually supplied indirectly to enemy
                                    warships. Towards the middle of 1915, therefore, the British
                                    Government decided to abandon the policy of the black list in
                                    favour of a policy by which British coal is exported only to
                                    reliable firms who are known as regular importers, and who have
                                    agreed not to supply any coal (not only British coal) to enemy
                                    ships or to ships trading to enemy countries or to any other
                                    ships specially notified by the British authorities; not to
                                    supply coal to any firm known to be supplying goods to the
                                    enemy; not to use the coal for the production of goods or
                                    by-products destined for the enemy; and, finally, not to
                                    transfer coal to another importer without permission. These
                                    firms are placed on a fist called the “Regular and Reliable List
                                    of Coal Importers” or the “coal white list.” As a failure to
                                    abide by this undertaking renders the firm liable to be refused
                                    all future supplies of British coal, firms of high standing and
                                    large connections have the strongest inducement to observe the
                                    conditions faithfully.</p>
                                <p>The experience of the British Government has been overwhelmingly
                                    in favour of the white-list policy as opposed to the black-list
                                    policy. It prevents coal reaching unreliable consignees either
                                    direct or through “dummies,” and it also prevents ships clearing
                                    with cargoes of coal ostensibly destined for a consignee in a
                                    neutral port, but really acting as supply ships for enemy
                                    warships. On military grounds alone, therefore, the policy is
                                    vindicated, but it is also of value because it enables pressure
                                    to be put upon manufacturing firms in countries adjacent to
                                    Germany to discontinue supplying manufactured articles to the
                                    enemy and further it is the foundation of the control exercised
                                    over neutral shipping through the supply of bunkers at ports
                                    abroad. If, therefore, the United States Government are willing
                                    to cooperate with the British Government in this matter, it is
                                    suggested that the cooperation should be on the lines of
                                    prohibiting the export of American coal to any firm not on a
                                    white list. In such event, it would be desirable that the two
                                    Governments should, so far as possible, work in close
                                    cooperation and that there should be one coal white list common
                                    to both Governments.</p>
                                <p>The British white list is at present compiled by the British
                                    Foreign Office on the advice of His Majesty’s representatives in
                                    foreign countries. <pb n="859" xml:id="pg_859" facs="0105"/>A

                                    abide by the “Conditions of Supply,” of which a copy is

                                    British Government would welcome the cooperation of the United
                                    States Government in the compilation of the white list in any
                                    way which appears desirable. In view of the fact that, from the
                                    point of view of tonnage, there are strong arguments, in the
                                    common interest, for discontinuing, so far as possible, the
                                    export of American coal to Europe, in favour of export to such
                                    destinations as the Plate, where American coal can be supplied
                                    with greater economy of shipping than British coal, one method
                                    of cooperation would be that the British Government should hand
                                    over to the United States Government the primary responsibility
                                    for the white list in South America, while themselves primarily
                                    remaining responsible for the white list in Europe.</p>

                                <p>Hitherto the policy of the British Government has been to
                                    impose-on neutral shipowners, in return for an unrestricted use
                                    of British coal, which is practically essential for their trade,
                                    conditions which they will recognise as reasonable in the

                                    reinforce the bunker conditions both in the direction of
                                    requiring neutral ships to perform a fuller measure of service

                                    cargoes, so as to reduce to a minimum the delays caused by
                                    examination in British ports. Should the United States

                                    direction, the British Government are anxious to enter into a
                                    discussion of the provisions which should be added to the
                                    present conditions in order to attain the above objects.</p>
                                <p>The general basis of the bunker control is the refusal of bunkers
                                    in British and Allied ports and in foreign ports, where British
                                    coal is used, to a neutral ship whose owner—or, if the ship is
                                    on time-charter, time-charterer, has not intimated to the
                                    British authorities his intention to abide by the “Conditions of
                                    Supply” not only in respect of the particular ship, but in
                                    respect of all ships owned or controlled by him. When an owner
                                    has given this undertaking all the ships controlled by him are
                                    added to the ships’ white list. They are then treated, generally
                                    speaking, in the same way as British or Allied ships and allowed
                                    unrestricted bunkers in any port where the control is in the

                                        >Not printed.</note> is now a very large list and it may be
                                    said that the great majority of neutral shipowners have given
                                    the required undertakings. The penalty for a breach of the
                                    undertaking is removal of the ships from the white list to the
                                    ships’ black list. The latter is a very small list and consists
                                    of ships whose owner or charterer has broken his undertaking,
                                    has traded with the enemy or supplied enemy warships. The ships’
                                    white list and black list are compiled by the British Admiralty
                                    under the instructions of a committee called the Bunker
                                    Committee on which the Foreign Office, Board of Trade and
                                    Admiralty are represented. Ships are removed from the black list
                                    only if time-chartered to the Inter-Allied Chartering
                                    Executive.</p>
                                <p>In the event of the bunker conditions being revised on the lines
                                    mentioned above, it would be necessary to remove from the ships’
                                    white list those ships whose owners do not make a satisfactory
                                    arrangement in regard to the employment of a proportion of their
                                    tonnage in essential Allied trades. This would involve a number
                                    of negotiations with individual shipowners and these
                                    negotiations would be carried out by the Bunker Committee. In
                                    connection with these negotiations the committee’s object would
                                    be to reduce to the minimum the employment of neutral ships in
                                    non-essential <pb n="861" xml:id="pg_861" facs="0107"/>trades
                                    and to divert the balance into trades essential for the war. The
                                    extent to which this object can be attained will depend largely
                                    upon the cooperation of the United States Government. If the
                                    United States Government does not control the use of American
                                    coal at all, it will be possible for the neutral shipowner to
                                    evade altogether the bunker control by importing American coal
                                    and/or loading bunkers in United States ports sufficient for the
                                    round voyage. This will, of course, be very expensive, but the
                                    prospect of remunerative trade out of the danger zone might be
                                    sufficiently attractive to induce the shipowner to incur this
                                    expense.</p>
                                <p>The machinery by which the bunker control is exercised is as

                                            regulated by the local customs officers who, under
                                            standing instructions from London, grant applications
                                            for bunkers to Allied ships and neutral ships on the
                                            ships’ white list. All other applications are referred
                                            to London where each case is considered on its merits.
                                            If it appears that the proposed voyage is in the
                                            interest of the Allies, bunkers are often granted, even
                                            though the ship is not on the white list.</item>

                                            communicates by telegram with the authorities in

                                <p>There appear to be three considerations in favour of the United
                                    States Government cooperating fully in the bunker policy defined
                                    above. First, the success of the war depends in large measure on
                                    every available ton of shipping being employed in the most
                                    economical manner possible and in essential trades. Secondly,
                                    the Allies may claim, not on the ground of their belligerent
                                    interests but on broad grounds of justice and public utility,
                                    that neutral ships, forming part of the world’s commercial
                                    service, shall share with the Allies the dangerous trades to a
                                    reasonable extent. Thirdly, the interests of the United States
                                    must always be an important factor in administering any policy
                                    which aims at the control of tonnage and the British Government
                                    are therefore anxious that they should be fully informed of the
                                    needs and wishes of the United States in a way which can only
                                        <pb n="862" xml:id="pg_862" facs="0108"/>be wholly attained
                                    by the closest cooperation and consultation. If, therefore, the
                                    United States Government should decide to adopt a control on the
                                    same lines as and closely coordinated with that adopted by the
                                    British Government the latter would welcome such cooperation.
                                    If, however, the United States do not wish at this moment to
                                    identify themselves wholly with such a policy, it is hoped that
                                    they will at least take such steps as are necessary to prevent
                                    American coal being used to weaken or evade the control at
                                    present exercised by means of British coal. In this event, the
                                    necessary steps would be that the United States Government
                                    should (1) limit the export of American coal to firms on the
                                    Regular and Reliable List of Coal Importers (coal white list)
                                    and (2) control the supply of bunkers in the ports of the United
                                    States and its territories and possessions in such a way as to
                                    prevent a neutral ship bunkering for the round voyage or, in
                                    fact, for a voyage further than to the next suitable bunkering
                                    port. It must, however, be pointed out that this policy might
                                    not really be sufficient to attain the objects aimed at since it
                                    might not avail to prevent a neutral ship in an American port
                                    from taking sufficient bunkers to carry her to her home port for
                                    the purpose of there laying up for the remainder of the war.</p>

                            <p>It has been suggested in the report of the Subcommittee on Export
                                Licenses that the work of fixing rations on a statistical basis must
                                remain mainly in the hands of the War Trade Statistical Department
                                and the Rationing Committee in London; while the work of
                                investigating and passing upon the character of consignees for goods
                                in neutral countries will have largely to remain in the hands of the
                                War Trade Intelligence Department. The question appears to be “how
                                far the United States Government can assist or supplement the
                                machinery of these committees in London for gathering information as
                                to the situation in neutral countries.”</p>
                            <p>So far as the character of consignees in neutral countries is
                                concerned, it will probably be sufficient to instruct American
                                consular officers in those countries to report any indications that
                                may have come or may come to their notice that American goods are
                                reaching unreliable consignees. For the rest, as the working of the
                                licensing system develops, American consular officers will doubtless
                                be instructed from time to time to report their opinion as to firms
                                whom the British Government informs the United States licensing
                                authority that they regard as unreliable.</p>
                            <p>To pass on to the very complicated question of what may be called
                                rationing information, the War Trade Statistical Department in
                                London at present has the following information, based upon official
                                statistical reports from consular and diplomatic officers, Secret
                                Service channels, and information supplied confidentially by
                                associations such as the Danish Merchants’ Guild: <list>

                                        are usually not available even if the statistics are

                            <p>The Government of the United States could probably aid the work of
                                the War Trade Statistical Department by furnishing to the Department
                                at short intervals detailed statements of exports from the United
                                States to the various countries. This would to a certain extent
                                enable the authorities in London to dispense with less certain means
                                of information, such as checking of manifests, which is found
                                necessary at present. As regards exports of neutral countries to
                                Germany, it is thought that American consular officers, Treasury
                                agents, and commercial attachés may be able to furnish additional
                                information on certain points, if only in view of the fact that
                                during the past two and one-half years their neutrality has possibly
                                given them access to sources of information from which belligerent
                                consuls have been excluded.</p>
                            <p>In some cases also American officials may have special knowledge; for
                                instance, the American officials at Amsterdam might be able
                                materially to assist the British Consul in the control of diamond
                                exports.</p>
                            <p>Generally it would be well that all officials abroad under the
                                control of the Departments of State, Commerce, and Treasury be
                                instructed to offer assistance to their British colleagues and
                                especially to report after consultation with them, whether they have
                                any indications that American goods are passing through neutral
                                countries into enemy hands.</p>
                            <p>We venture to suggest that the United States Government might furnish
                                very definite assistance to the Allied Governments if they were to
                                demand from neutrals official statements of their exports to enemy
                                countries. As already stated, no statistics can be obtained as to
                                exports from Norway and only statistics as to food exports can be
                                obtained in the case of Denmark though there is every reason to
                                believe that by-products of cattle, such as hair, bone, and hides,
                                are being exported, besides such articles as vegetable fibres. In
                                Holland, Sweden, and Switzerland, official statistics are issued
                                though they are very belated in the case of the latter country, but
                                these official statistics cannot be regarded as complete or reliable
                                and they have to be supplemented by various other sources of
                                information. It is suggested that, when Swedish or other delegates
                                who are on their way to America, begin their negotiations here, they
                                should be informed that it is impossible for the United States
                                Government to feel any certainty in allowing exports until the
                                neutral Governments concerned supply complete and reliable
                                statistics of exports to the enemy. As such countries as Sweden and
                                Holland would doubtless reply to such representations that their
                                existing statistics are absolutely exhaustive and as it will be
                                impossible to meet this argument by any reference to the very
                                confidential figures in possession of the British Government, it
                                would be well to obtain as soon as possible <pb n="865"
                                    xml:id="pg_865" facs="0111"/>from the United States consular and
                                other officers in those countries reports giving reasons which could
                                be quoted for believing that the official statistics are incomplete.
                                This might perhaps be done immediately by telegraph.</p>
                            <p>Similar, demands might be made to the neutral Governments for
                                information as to statistics of agricultural and other production in
                                the respective countries.</p>
                            <p>This subcommittee is in possession of such statistics as are
                                available and can present them to the conference if that body shall
                                so desire. It is not, however, thought that the major conference
                                will wish to take up such a detailed matter as these statistics of
                                the various items of import and export into and from neutral
                                countries.</p>
                            <p>We also venture to suggest that, if it should be desired that the
                                committee continue in existence for the purpose of collecting
                                statistics, such a committee be formed of the representatives of the
                                Departments of State, Commerce, and Treasury, and be prepared to
                                supervise in a general way the War Statistical Division which in the
                                report of the Committee on Export Licenses it is proposed to set
                                up.</p>

                                        in accordance with the views expressed in Notes 9–16,
                                        inclusive. As probably the British “coal white list” is a
                                        compromise between France and Great Britain, there should be
                                        no objection to a list being prepared to which the United
                                        States could agree.</p>

                                steps as are necessary to prevent American coal being used to weaken
                                or evade the control at present exercised by means of British coal,
                                by (1) limiting the export of American coal to firms on the “coal
                                white list,” and (2) preventing neutral ships from bunkering for the
                                round voyage, or further than the next suitable bunkering port, so
                                that from that point they would come under British control. <quote

                                    rend="italic">pawns</hi>] with which he can bargain for such
                                guarantees are Antwerp, Briey and Longwy.</p>
                            <p>This admission, although it has no direct relation with the statutory
                                list, nevertheless proves that commercial pressure makes a very
                                strong impression on influential opinion in Germany, confirms the
                                contention of H. M. G. that measures inflicting progressive economic
                                damage constitute a direct and forcible weapon of offence, and
                                should serve to convince the U. S. Government of the inadvisability
                                of refraining from the use of a powerful and humane weapon which
                                lies ready to their hand, both by means of action within the U. S.
                                and by means of the statutory list outside, for the purpose of
                                hastening peace.</p>

                                <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Counsellor</hi>: On thinking over
                                your suggestion this morning that we should put on record any points
                                which seem to us to be still outstanding from our discussions on war
                                trade matters, in order that it may be possible to clear such points
                                up before the departure of the mission, the situation seems to be as
                                follows:</p>
                            <p>The subjects discussed fall into three classes:</p>
                            <p>1. The demands to be made on neutrals both in regard to shipping and
                                in regard to their exports to the Allies and to our enemies. We have
                                already sufficiently explained our difficulties and the ways in
                                which you can help us. We can only leave you to evolve your own <pb
                                    n="872" xml:id="pg_872" facs="0118"/>policy from these data. We
                                shall doubtless furnish you from time to time with fresh suggestions
                                as to the directions in which we think further pressure might be
                                applied and we stand ready to tell you anything you wish to know in
                                the course of your negotiations with neutrals. But for the moment
                                there seems to be little more to discuss.</p>
                            <p>2. Trading with the enemy. Here there is some divergence between our
                                respective views, though in practice that divergence will probably
                                prove to be not so great as discussions of principle or of our past
                                practice may seem to indicate. We have agreed that there shall be an
                                examination into the facts by an American representative in London
                                who will be appointed as soon as possible, and pending this, I
                                hardly think that further verbal discussions would be of much
                                use.</p>
                            <p>The question of the machinery necessary to a system of export
                                restrictions in this country has, I think, been fully discussed.
                                What remains to be worked out can be worked out by the Embassy and
                                the competent departments here as time goes on, and the mission need
                                hardly concern itself further with the details.</p>
                            <p>3. There remains the question of bunker and coal policy. Here we have
                                put to you two alternatives, and we have communicated to you a copy
                                of new draft bunker conditions which we should like you to join us
                                in adopting if you decide to accept the alternative of full
                                co-operation. What we should like to do before the mission goes is— <list>
                                    <label>(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>)</label>
                                    <item>To go through with you these draft conditions, in order to
                                        explain them and point out the respects in which we are
                                        prepared to modify them if you wish, and</item>
                                    <label>(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>)</label>
                                    <item>To explain the machinery necessary for the proper
                                        enforcement of any bunker policy. This will largely be a
                                        question of administrative detail, and we can either
                                        communicate our information—copies of our rules and forms,
                                        etc.—to you, or we can take it up with any department or
                                        official you may designate.</item>
                                </list>
                            </p>
                            <p>If we can have these discussions, I think we shall have unburdened
                                ourselves of the information and suggestions which the mission came
                                to bring, and the rest can be left by the mission for subsequent
                                consultation between you and the Embassy when you have decided on
                                the policy you are prepared to adopt and have acquired the powers to
                                carry it out.</p>
                            <p>If you can appoint a time for these discussions, we might perhaps
                                take the opportunity of talking over a little more fully and finally
                                the appointment of the various American representatives who are to
                                take up in detail in London the complicated questions which the
                                mission has only been able to raise and explain in principle during
                                their visit here.</p>
                            <p>Yours sincerely,</p>

                                        <item>The first proposal is, that the United States take
                                            such steps as may be necessary to prevent American coal
                                            being used to evade the control at present exercised by

                                            coal, and that this be accomplished by the United States
                                            (1) prohibiting neutral ships from bunkering for the
                                            round voyage or farther than the next suitable bunkering
                                            port, and (2) limiting the supply of American cargo coal
                                            to persons on the “coal white list” who have subscribed
                                            to the “Conditions of Supply of Cargo Coal,” mentioned

                                                  zone against the wishes of the shipowners. This
                                                  stipulation is made not so much in the interest of
                                                  the owner as of the crew. To this end paragraph
                                                  (13) should read as follows: “Every firm which

                                                  The amount and character of the service to be
                                                  determined by a committee composed of

                                            does not thereby waive the contentions which it has

                                            those measures or the grounds upon which they are
                                            founded, but that, on the contrary, the action of the
                                            United States is based on its intention, as a domestic
                                            measure, to prevent supplies from reaching enemy raiders
                                            or submarines, to prevent trading with, for the benefit

                                            to prevent the carriage of contraband of war, to
                                            conserve the supplies of the United States for its own
                                            use and the use of its allies, and to economize ships’
                                            tonnage for the transportation of military necessities
                                            for the United States and its allies.</item>

                            <p>6357. Foreign Office informs me that a telegram has been received
                                from the British Chargé d’Affaires in Washington stating that our
                                Government proposes to establish a permanent technical mission in
                                London for all war-trade objects. The British Government hope that
                                the appointment of the delegates will be made as soon as possible so
                                that discussions regarding rationing and tonnage question may take
                                place here at a very early date.</p>

                                understanding that United States would consent to prevent

                                of ways and means of giving practical effect to this idea and would
                                welcome informal expression American views on prevention exports to

                                response to your suggestion, a summary of our suggestions in regard
                                to the treatment of neutral countries under your “embargo”
                                legislation.</p>
                            <p>We are receiving repeated cables from the Foreign Office enquiring
                                your attitude in regard to various of these proposals, but above all
                                in regard to the two questions of coal for Spain and Swedish transit
                                to Russia. I must really impress on you, under instructions from Mr.
                                    <persName corresp="frus1917Supp02v01#p_BAJ1">Balfour</persName>,
                                the extreme urgency of these two questions. Over 40,000 tons of
                                American coal were recently landed in Spain, and the continued
                                difficulties with regard to Swedish transit can not fail to arouse
                                discontent in Russia and further complicate the Russian situation
                                which is already sufficiently serious. Both these questions are ones
                                on which the merits of the case, the obligations of the neutral
                                Governments concerned, the practical considerations arising out of
                                the tonnage situation, and the interests and rights of the United
                                States are all eminently clear and point in one direction, while the
                                dangers of delay, as creating a situation which it will be
                                impossible later to remedy are also obvious. I sincerely trust that
                                you may be able to give me an answer on these two points which will
                                enable me to answer Mr. <persName corresp="frus1917Supp02v01#p_BAJ1"

                                    negotiations with neutral countries in regard to the export of
                                    goods from the United States. The following is a summary of the
                                    first steps which it is suggested might be taken in the case of
                                    each country.</p>
                                <p>It is assumed that, as a basis for the proposed negotiations, the
                                    United States Government will suspend all licenses for exports
                                    to the Scandinavian countries and Holland as soon as the
                                    licensing system comes into operation. Then, as a condition
                                    precedent to the issue of licenses for any exports, it is
                                    suggested that the following demands might be made.</p>

                                    or make any definite demands on the Spanish Government, who will
                                    be almost immediately forced into an arrangement with Great
                                    Britain, both in regard to supplies of iron ore, pyrites and
                                    other essential materials to the Allies and the United States,
                                    and in regard to the proper employment of Spanish shipping. The
                                    United States will, however, doubtless wish to require Spain to
                                    share with Holland—with perhaps the assistance of Sweden—the
                                    whole burden of transporting overseas supplies for Belgian and

                            <p>The espionage bill recently passed by Congress and signed by the
                                President authorizes him to issue by proclamation an embargo on the
                                exportation of certain merchandise to certain countries. The
                                Department has not been informed of any measures having as yet been
                                adopted and proclaimed by the President under this authority.</p>
                            <p>With reference to shipments of this nature to Norway, Sweden and
                                Denmark the procedure heretofore recognized of applying to the Trade
                                Department of the British Embassy at this Capital for navicerts will
                                continue in effect until such time as some measure of export control
                                is issued by the President.</p>

                                is suggested, as a practical matter, that you inquire of the proper
                                officials of the railroads over which you desire to make such

                                    xml:id="d36fn1">Not printed.</note> in which, on behalf of your
                                clients, The Atlantic Refining Co., you seek advice as to whether
                                they would be justified in shipping petroleum to certain firms in

                                Vincent, Cape Verde, is, in consequence of his intercourse with
                                Hamburg and his relations with the North German <persName

                                under grave suspicion.</p>
                            <p>It has been made known to the Department that the firm, known as
                                Antonio Miguel de Carvalho &amp; Co., which, apparently, has
                                recently taken over the business of Joaquin de St. Maurice, is under
                                like suspicion, and that there is danger that the consignment of
                                petroleum, to which you refer, if shipped to this company, would be
                                used to the advantage of the enemy.</p>
                            <p>As bearing on the matter, the Department may call your attention to
                                the rule enunciated by American courts to the effect that
                                intercourse, either directly or indirectly, between residents of
                                enemy countries is illegal; also to the fact that there is now
                                pending before Congress, as you probably are aware, a bill (H. R.
                                4704) with regard to trade with the enemy. A copy of the bill is

                                    is about to be undertaken, and since the power is vested by the

                            <p>There will, of course, be no prohibition of exports. The normal
                                course of trade will be interfered with as little as possible, and,
                                so far as possible, only its abnormal course directed. The whole
                                object will be to direct exports in such a way that they will go
                                first and by preference where they are most needed and most
                                immediately needed, and temporarily to withhold them, if necessary,
                                where they can best be spared.</p>
                            <p>Our primary duty in the matter of foodstuffs and like necessaries is
                                to see to it that the peoples associated with us in the war get as
                                generous a proportion as possible of our surplus; but it will also
                                be our wish and purpose to supply the neutral nations whose peoples
                                depend upon us for such supplies as nearly in proportion to their
                                need as the amount to be divided permits.</p>
                            <p>There will, thus, be little check put upon the volume of exports and
                                the prices obtained for them will not be affected by this
                                regulation.</p>
                            <p>This policy will be carried out, not by prohibitive regulations,
                                therefore, but by a system of licensing exports, which will be as
                                simply organized and administered as possible, so as to constitute
                                no impediment to the normal flow of commerce. In brief, the free
                                play of trade will not be arbitrarily interfered with; it will only
                                be intelligently and systematically directed in the light of full
                                information with regard to needs and market conditions throughout
                                the world and the necessities of our people at home and our armies
                                and the armies of our associates abroad.</p>
                            <p>The Government is taking, or has taken, steps to ascertain, for
                                example, just what the available present supply of wheat and corn is
                                remaining from the crops of last year; to learn from each of the
                                countries exporting these foodstuffs from the United States what
                                their purchases in this country now are, and where they are stored;
                                and what their needs are, in order that we may adjust things so far
                                as possible to our own needs and free stocks; and this information
                                is in course of being rapidly supplied.</p>
                            <p>The case of wheat and corn will serve as an illustration of all the
                                rest, of supplies of all kinds. Our trade can be successfully and
                                profitably conducted now, the war pushed to a victorious issue, and
                                the needs of our own people and of the other peoples with whom we
                                are still free to trade efficiently met only by systematic
                                direction; and that is what will be attempted. <persName

                                <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have received the urgent
                                instructions of my Government to point out to you the serious and
                                dangerous difficulties which His Majesty’s Government have to
                                encounter in dealing with the question of the curtailment of
                                supplies to enemy countries pending the announcement <pb n="887"
                                    xml:id="pg_887" facs="0133"/>of the policy which the United
                                States Government intend to adopt in this matter.</p>
                            <p>These difficulties extend over the whole field of the various
                                memoranda which have recently been presented to the Department of
                                State on all the aspects of trade with neutral countries contiguous
                                to Germany, and the Embassy has already had occasion to point out
                                the special difficulties and dangers connected with the urgent
                                questions of the shipment of American coal to Spain and the refusal
                                by the Swedish Government of reasonable transit facilities for the
                                passage of goods to Russia. I am now instructed to put before you
                                two additional instances of the grave disadvantage of the present
                                uncertainty.</p>
                            <p>On April 28 last, His Majesty’s Government entered into a contract to
                                buy the output of one of the principal molybdenite mines in Norway.
                                This contract was concluded on very onerous terms in order to
                                prevent the ore reaching the enemy. Several other companies have now
                                approached His Majesty’s Government with offers to sell their
                                output. If His Majesty’s Government buy, they must do so in
                                competition with Germany and pay exorbitant prices. If they do not
                                buy, the mines will almost certainly make contracts with the enemy
                                who will thus secure large supplies of molybdenite and the
                                transaction, having become a <hi rend="italic">fait accompli</hi>,
                                will hopelessly prejudice any subsequent demands which the United
                                States may make to the Norwegian Government.</p>
                            <p>A similar difficulty exists in the case of the fish agreement in
                                Norway, by which His Majesty’s Government have for some time past
                                secured a large part of the Norwegian catch. Not only is this
                                agreement unsatisfactory in itself, because it has in the past
                                allowed a quantity of fish to reach Germany amounting to roughly
                                half as much again as the total quantity required for Norwegian home
                                consumption and because it has involved heavy financial expenditures
                                which His Majesty’s Government can ill support at this moment.
                                Furthermore its maintenance is now in jeopardy since the Norwegian
                                Government are pressing His Majesty’s Government for 25 per cent
                                increase on present prices and for the recognition of an increased
                                percentage of export to Germany. … Meanwhile His Majesty’s
                                Government have to allot valuable tonnage in order to transport
                                about one hundred thousand tons of salt to Norway a year.</p>
                            <p>These are of course not the only two instances in which the whole
                                policy of limiting the supplies of the enemy is now in danger. In
                                these circumstances the neutral Governments concerned need only
                                delay and defer negotiations with the Government of the United
                                States until they have created a situation which no intervention by
                                the United States will subsequently avail to remedy. I may add that
                                the present uncertainty also gravely affects the continuance of such
                                humanitarian enterprises as the relief of Belgium and northern <pb
                                    n="888" xml:id="pg_888" facs="0134"/>France since it is becoming
                                less and less possible every day to allot to the Commission for
                                Relief in Belgium Allied shipping or neutral shipping under the
                                control of the Allies. The relief work can not therefore long
                                continue unless the course already suggested of requiring the Dutch
                                and Spanish Governments, as patrons of the relief committee, to
                                provide tonnage required for the transport of relief supplies is
                                speedily adopted.</p>
                            <p>I am therefore instructed by Mr. <persName

                                the earnest hope that you will recognise the urgency of this matter
                                and that you will be able to come to a speedy decision upon the
                                discussions which have now been conducted between our two
                                Governments for two months. I am to add that His Majesty’s
                                Government are firmly convinced that on the immediate decision of
                                these problems depends the question whether the war shall be
                                shortened by a drastic restriction of German supplies, or whether it
                                is to be seriously prolonged by the absence of such
                                restrictions.</p>

                                <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Secretary of State</hi>: I have had
                                repeatedly occasion to draw by word of mouth or in writing the
                                attention of the Department of State to the expediency of measures
                                to be taken with a view to preventing neutrals profiting by
                                shipments from abroad and being able to help our common enemy with
                                supplies.</p>
                            <p>By order of my Government I venture to draw Your Excellency’s
                                especial notice to the great importance and urgency of measures of
                                this character at this time. This is the time of the year when
                                awaiting the new crop they ought to be most effective. The Germans,
                                of course, are straining every effort to obtain at this critical
                                time large shipments from the neighboring countries; that of 200,000
                                head of cattle contemplated by Holland, which is known to Your
                                Excellency, is a striking example. It is now that we should be
                                proportionately vigilant to meet those efforts and make as effective
                                as possible this means which we have of expediting in the interest
                                of our fellow countrymen and of the whole world the return of peace.
                                That those shipments have been heretofore extremely important is not
                                open to <pb n="889" xml:id="pg_889" facs="0135"/>doubt. Statistics
                                made with the greatest care show that in 1916 the quantities of
                                foodstuffs imported into Germany from the northern countries alone
                                have almost equalled what is necessary for the whole German Army.
                                They aggregated about 2,300,000 tons; let us say 1,250,000 from
                                Holland; 560,000 from Denmark; and 500,000 from Norway. Now, put the
                                daily ration at one kilo per capita, which is surely higher than the
                                normal, these imports were enough to feed during five weeks the
                                whole German population, or if the Army alone is taken into
                                consideration, nearly the whole of it for twelve months. The imports
                                of meat alone from the same countries reached last year, as will be
                                seen from a document which I will forward to Your Excellency,<note
                                    n="1" xml:id="d41fn1">Not printed.</note> 440,000 tons. The
                                German soldier’s ration being 200 grammes a day, those shipments
                                sufficed to feed eight million men; that is to say, all the
                                Austro-German Army during 275 days. Imports into Holland of grain,
                                corn, fertilizers, fodder, etc., from America enabled the Dutch to
                                carry on intensive breeding to produce much more than they can
                                consume; to export potatoes which, except for the arrivals of
                                American wheat, they would have been compelled to reserve for their
                                own use instead of turning them over to the Germans for food. To the
                                great advantage of the Germans, the fisheries were particularly
                                successful this year. In one day (May 11, last), there was put on
                                shore at Skagen, Denmark, 500,000 pounds of fish, notwithstanding
                                which, so large is the exportation, fish is sometimes wanting in
                                Copenhagen.</p>
                            <p>In the countries that are growing rich in this way, there are issued,
                                to be sure, statistics showing that on the contrary, their exports
                                are much reduced. Thus, those relative to the Danish herd which are
                                reproduced in the issue of May 26 last of the <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Commerce Reports</hi> show that instead of a decrease, the
                                number of head of cattle in the country had rather increased. Now,
                                we know from indisputable consular testimony that the sale of cattle
                                to Germany reached figures which excluded such results. A report
                                from one of our consuls on what he had found during the week ending
                                April 14 shows that in that short period of time at Esbjerg, for
                                instance, out of a total of 1,250 animals on the market, German
                                purchasers bought 1,146; at Holstebro, out of 1,250 head they bought
                                1,084. For the whole of Jutland, the export to Germany exceeded
                                during that week, 5,000 head. These figures, furthermore, are not
                                exceptional, and are sometimes exceeded. They reached 5,500 in the
                                first week of May.</p>
                            <p>As for horses, of which an average of 1,500 a month is shipped, a
                                Danish-German arrangement has just authorized the export of 10,000
                                horses in return for which the Germans would refrain from attacking
                                Danish vessels sailing outside of the danger zone. It could hardly
                                be believed that in order to be admitted to safe navigation <pb
                                    n="890" xml:id="pg_890" facs="0136"/>in a safety zone, marked
                                out by the Germans themselves, they should in addition be
                                indemnified in this way. This blackmail applied to neutrals shows
                                once more how our enemies understand the application of the laws of
                                war.</p>
                            <p>As for ourselves and the means of pressure to be brought to bear on
                                those same neutrals to prevent them from destroying the effect of
                                one of our principal efforts, the situation is quite different.
                                These neutrals apply to several of the countries comprising the
                                group to which we belong, and ask for assistance by which they
                                profit to help our adversaries. We can not be expected to agree to
                                that. It is indeed a generally accepted rule of international law
                                that a belligerent may and must see to it that the products of its
                                soil or industry may not either directly or through go-betweens be
                                used by its enemies. This principle has besides been recognized by
                                the neutrals themselves, and against us. In this way, Switzerland
                                admitted that coal supplied to its manufacturers by Germany could
                                not be used in manufacturing articles intended for the Allies even
                                if the other elements in the manufacture were neutral or Allied. The
                                German Government could not, in any event, even in the worst of
                                tempers, find fault with its neighbors on the ground that they
                                refused to make shipments which they could no longer make if
                                arrivals of provisions coming to them from abroad stopped.</p>
                            <p>The United States appears to be on account of its immense resources
                                the country from which those neighboring Germany have been
                                endeavoring to draw the largest share of supplies. Now there is no
                                reason, humane or other, for their continuing to obtain them. Your
                                Excellency will no doubt think that under these conditions a
                                positive refusal from the United States, at war with Germany, would
                                be at the present time, as effective as it is warranted. The
                                countries concerned, as a matter of fact, have no actual need of
                                food assistance for themselves, and they are in any event quite
                                sufficiently provided for to await a complete settlement of the
                                question, which is going to be taken up without delay by experts to
                                be designated by the Allied Governments, and notably by the United
                                States. These experts will have to examine what quota may be
                                warranted and under what guarantees according to cases and
                                countries. In the meanwhile, in the large quantities of cattle,
                                pork, cheese, fish, etc., which are still going from Scandinavia or
                                Holland to Germany is a safe guarantee that their people are in no
                                wise threatened with starvation, and that nothing could be more
                                opportune than to compel them to live on their own resources by
                                depriving them of outside help. The same thing applies to the
                                feeding of their cattle. Without mentioning Holland, where the
                                question does not even arise, positive information shows that the
                                Danish cattle can find nearly all their food in Denmark, but that
                                the inhabitants earnestly wish to receive oil cakes and other <pb
                                    n="891" xml:id="pg_891" facs="0137"/>fodder from the United
                                States in order to be able to sell their fattened animals to the
                                Germans with a better profit. They have no right to expect us to
                                help them in this.</p>
                            <p>With all the better reason is it important to deprive those countries
                                of material used in manufactures exported to Germany and directly
                                useful in the prosecution of the war, as, for instance, sulphur
                                which Sweden draws from the United States and which is used in the
                                manufacture of paper pulp. Large quantities of that product are
                                exported to Germany where it is used in making bags, for trenches
                                and also to take the place of cotton for certain explosives.

                            <p>The following memorandum has been drawn up in reply to informal
                                enquiries from the Department of State regarding the weight to be
                                attached to the argument, put forward by neutral European
                                Governments, that drastic restrictions of their supplies from the
                                United States would “throw them into the arms of Germany.”</p>
                            <p>In general, the reply to this argument is that neutral countries,
                                which have given every possible proof for three years of the supreme
                                value which they attach to the maintenance of neutrality, will not
                                take sides with that one of the belligerents with whom their peoples
                                as a whole have the least sympathy, at the very moment when that
                                belligerent has the whole world ranged against it and is, to say the
                                least, facing complete military, economic and political ruin, unless
                                the restrictions imposed upon them are such as to imperil their
                                honour or the livelihood of their people. This general statement
                                applies even to Sweden and Spain, where large sections of the
                                people—that is to say, the governing classes—have in the past shown
                                themselves friendly to Germany, for even in these countries any open
                                departure from neutrality in favour of Germany could not fail to
                                rouse the working classes at least and to lead to strikes and riots,
                                if not to actual revolution.</p>
                            <p>Now, neither the British nor the American Government have ever
                                contemplated any policy towards these neutrals incompatible either
                                with their honour or their welfare. The policy of restrictions which
                                is now under discussion amounts to nothing more than a threefold

                                that popular resentment and antagonism without which no government
                                can to-day venture upon a rupture of friendly international
                                relations.</p>
                            <p>More, any such rupture would forfeit the benefits and services which
                                all these countries are now receiving from Great Britain and the
                                United States. British ships have relieved Norwegian ships from the
                                maintenance of dangerous services to Norway in the North Sea.
                                British mines in 1916 provided Norway and Denmark with 4,613,162
                                tons of coal against a normal peace importation of coal by those
                                countries from all sources, less exports, of no more than 4,972,331
                                tons. In addition Great Britain has supplied Sweden and Holland in
                                1916 with 2,992,631 tons of coal, and these figures do not include
                                all the services maintained for the benefit of these countries by
                                British bunkers in British and other ports. These are only two
                                instances of manifold services which are still being continued,
                                partly, it is true, in the interests of the Allies themselves but
                                mainly for no other purpose than to supply these countries with
                                their reasonable needs. The interests of the Allies could have been
                                far better served, so far as merely material considerations are
                                concerned, by a policy of threatening demands, from which they have
                                always consciously and deliberately refrained. Germany cannot
                                replace the services which the Allies have rendered and thus, even
                                if public opinion could allow the neutrals to gravitate towards
                                Germany, they could only do so at the cost of material losses out of
                                all proportion to the reasonable restrictions which it is supposed
                                would cause their alienation.</p>
                            <p>To sum up this phase of the question, the British Government can
                                guarantee that their present relations with the neutral Governments
                                concerned, tested as they have been by three years of continual
                                negotiation and controversy, give no cause whatever to apprehend any
                                rupture of any kind. If any proof of this were needed it would be
                                found in the fact that, within the last few days, the British
                                Government have agreed no longer to withhold facilities, so far as
                                it concerns <pb n="894" xml:id="pg_894" facs="0140"/>them, for the
                                shipment of large quantities of arms and ammunition and explosives
                                to Holland. They do not, indeed, view such shipments with approval,
                                but their reluctance to facilitate them has had nothing to do with
                                any fear that such equipment could be used against them.</p>
                            <p>There is, however, another similar argument which is frequently urged
                                by neutrals, namely, that any refusal on their part to allow exports
                                to Germany would expose them to attack from Germany. It is not
                                believed that, in the present military situation, Germany could in
                                any circumstances afford to effect so considerable a diversion of
                                her forces as would be entailed by an attack on Holland, Denmark or
                                Switzerland, still less such a one as would be necessary to attack
                                Norway or Sweden. No one of these countries has been generally
                                supposed to be so open to attack, or has more often alleged her
                                dangerous position as a pretext for maintaining large exports to
                                Germany, than Denmark; yet when recently a bill was introduced into
                                the Danish Parliament to reduce the emergency force maintained as a
                                safeguard against a surprise attack, it was accepted by all parties
                                except the Conservatives. This certainly does not indicate any great
                                apprehension of a German invasion and a similar tendency may be
                                observed in the other countries. It is no longer the German armies
                                that are feared, but the German submarines, and the latter can make
                                few if any worse attacks on neutrals than they are already making.
                                The most, therefore, that contiguous neutrals have to fear from
                                Germany merely as reprisals for an interruption of commercial
                                relations would be sudden acts of terrorism such as aircraft attacks
                                of which both the Dutch and the Norwegians have on various occasions
                                shown themselves afraid. Such attacks might be very serious in such
                                a country as Norway but even this possibility is hypothetical and
                                remote and should be regarded rather as a danger to be forestalled
                                by consultation between the United States and British General
                                Staffs, who are probably in a position to concert measures to meet
                                it, than as an argument in favour of inaction.</p>
                            <p>The argument as to “throwing the neutrals into the arms of Germany”
                                is, however, sometimes put in a more practical form, namely, that
                                these neutral countries, if they are dependent upon the Allies and
                                upon the United States for supplies and shipping, are also dependent
                                upon Germany for supplies which neither the European Allies nor the
                                United States can furnish. In these circumstances, it is argued, if
                                the neutrals are forced to choose between trade with Germany and
                                trade with Germany’s enemies, the economic arguments in favour of
                                either choice may be so evenly balanced as to make the fear of
                                Germany’s anger the determining factor, even though that fear might
                                not in itself be sufficient to make them break with the Allies.
                                There is some superficial force in this argument since, as <pb
                                    n="895" xml:id="pg_895" facs="0141"/>regards coal at any rate,
                                some of the neutrals are really, as things stand at present,
                                dependent upon Germany. Norway and Denmark receive sufficient coal
                                from the United Kingdom, as has already been pointed out, but
                                Sweden, Holland and Switzerland get a large proportion of their coal
                                from Germany. Switzerland stands on a different footing in many ways
                                from the other contiguous neutrals. As regards Sweden and Holland,
                                their imports of coal from non-German sources in 1916, as compared
                                with their normal imports from all sources, were as follows: <table

                            <p rend="flushleft">But, while this might seem to furnish a strong case
                                for these neutrals to allege the absolute necessity of continuing
                                their trade with Germany, a closer examination of the situation will
                                show that, if they accept our demands, we are not necessarily
                                incapable of replacing the supplies which Germany might consequently
                                cut off, in so far as those supplies are really necessary. It must
                                be remembered that a general reduction of supplies such as, <hi
                                    rend="italic">ex hypothesi</hi>, the neutrals, like the
                                belligerents, must face, of itself reduces the need for coal.
                                Denmark, in face of the conviction that she would be unable to
                                obtain the large quantities of fats, oils, fodder, etc., which she
                                originally demanded from overseas, has, in recent negotiations in
                                London, stated that she will need only 1,200,000 tons of coal a year
                                from the United Kingdom, owing to the reduction of industrial
                                activity which will be entailed by a restriction of these imports.
                                This amounts to less than half her normal coal imports and, <hi
                                    rend="italic">prima facie</hi>, it might not be unfair to divide
                                the requirements of Sweden and Holland for coal by half in a similar
                                way. The total annual requirements of these two countries would then
                                fall to only some 5,800,000, or no more than about 2,800,000 tons
                                more than the United Kingdom actually sent them in 1916. There would
                                be nothing impossible in Great Britain increasing her coal
                                production for export by this amount, but even such an increase in
                                production might be unnecessary since, as shown above, Denmark is
                                taking this year some 1,100,000 tons less from the United Kingdom
                                than she did in 1916, and in 1916 the United Kingdom sent some
                                1,130,000 tons to Chile, Brazil, Uruguay and the Argentine, a burden
                                which it is hoped that the United States will now take off our
                                shoulders. The 2,230,000 tons thus hypothetically released would
                                almost suffice to cover the additional needs of Holland and Sweden,
                                provided only that those countries will provide the shipping
                                necessary to carry this coal from the United Kingdom, as the Danes
                                have been doing in the past and will almost certainly continue to
                                do.</p>
                            <pb n="896" xml:id="pg_896" facs="0142"/>
                            <p>It is not, of course, pretended that this calculation is other than
                                extremely conjectural, but it may serve as an instance of the extent
                                to which any allegation as to the necessary dependence of neutrals
                                on Germany must be accepted with reserve and examined in the
                                greatest detail. Moreover, it would be highly dangerous to assume
                                that Germany’s exports to these neutrals will not continue in
                                Germany’s own interest even if the importing neutrals cease to send
                                supplies to Germany. Germany has markets to preserve in these
                                countries and she has debts to pay there. Even if they entirely
                                stopped all exports to her, her exchange with them would inevitably
                                fall heavily below even its present figure if she were to stop all
                                exports to them. It must be remembered that, during the whole of
                                1915 at any rate, Germany continued to export enormous quantities of
                                coal to Antwerp for no other purpose than to maintain a
                                long-standing market. For the rest, the detailed problems of
                                neutrals’ dependence on the Central Empires must be left for minute
                                examination by the Allies and the United States in concert when the
                                neutrals produce reasoned evidence in support of their allegations.
                                For this purpose, consultation by experts in London would be
                                particularly profitable since constant discussions are proceeding
                                there with all these Governments, the details of which it is very
                                difficult to convey sufficiently quickly and fully to the Allied
                                representatives in Washington.</p>
                            <p>In conclusion, one other aspect of the question must be considered.
                                Those who plead that they ought not to be thrown into the arms of
                                Germany must show that they are not in those arms already. Short of
                                an actual entry into the war in alliance with Germany, an adventure
                                too wild to be contemplated for a moment, it may seriously be
                                doubted whether some of these neutrals could, by gravitating towards
                                Germany, show her more favour or add more to her strength than they
                                are already doing. One of them, Sweden, has in two years supplied
                                her with 9,000,000 tons of iron ore, with many thousands of tons of
                                steel-hardening metals and with raw material for explosives in
                                enormous quantities, while deliberately barring the way for the
                                passage even of ordinary commercial supplies to her opponent Russia.
                                Sweden has, moreover, forbidden any of her citizens to give the
                                Allies any guarantee against the re-exportation to Germany of any
                                goods imported from overseas and her governing classes have
                                constantly proclaimed their sympathy with the Central Empires and
                                their confidence in their ultimate victory. Norway, Denmark and
                                Holland have, indeed, shown a better appreciation than Sweden of the
                                meaning and obligations of neutrality, but Norway, like Sweden, has
                                provided Germany with indispensable steel-hardening metals and with
                                enormous quantities of sulphur ores, while all three have diverted
                                to Germany the food exports which they normally sent to Allied
                                countries and have very greatly increased those exports for
                                Germany’s <pb n="897" xml:id="pg_897" facs="0143"/>benefit, while
                                their own people are to-day going short of food. In any other
                                language than that of extreme legal technicality, these countries
                                have been and are a base of supplies for Germany. Their people are
                                quite aware of this and their sentiment revolts against it. They are
                                indeed sending some similar supplies, though in smaller quantities,
                                to the Allies which must at all costs be maintained, but while this
                                consideration may protect them from any legal accusation of breach
                                of neutrality, it does not lessen the assistance they have afforded
                                to our enemies, and the supreme importance which Great Britain
                                attaches to the maintenance of her supplies from these neutrals is
                                in itself a proof of the incalculable military benefits which
                                Germany has secured from the far larger share of these supplies
                                allotted to her during three years of war. If the policy of the
                                United States towards these neutrals is stated, as it can be stated,
                                in terms of essential justice and moderation, it is far more likely
                                that their people will be confirmed in their present anger against
                                Germany and encouraged to an open expression of their sympathy for
                                the Allies, than that they will gravitate towards the Central
                                Empires.</p>
                            <p>One last consideration must be emphasised. In this memorandum an
                                attempt has been made to state the broad facts of the situation as a
                                basis for the broad policy already advocated by Mr. <persName
                                    corresp="frus1917Supp02v01#p_BAJ1">Balfour</persName>’s mission
                                and by the British Embassy. The Allied Governments are convinced
                                that this policy is both right, necessary and safe. But when once
                                that policy is declared, Germany will undoubtedly counter it by a
                                still further hardening of her attitude towards these neutrals, by
                                threats and by demonstrations. The neutrals will come forward with
                                difficult arguments and doubtful pleas, possibly even with requests
                                for protection or assistance. The resulting negotiations will not
                                only involve questions of economic fact on which the British Embassy
                                can in part supply information to supplement the independent
                                investigations of United States representatives abroad, but will
                                also raise military and strategic problems which cannot adequately
                                be dealt with merely through the diplomatic channel. Military and
                                naval measures of a precautionary kind may have to be concerted as a
                                basis for such assurances to neutrals as may be necessary to confirm
                                their resistance to German threats. Short of this, any such problem
                                as that of the coal supply touched on above involves decisions as to
                                the relative importance of man-power in the army and in industry,
                                the allotment of tonnage and the protection of routes in the North
                                Sea. Such decisions are among the most important that any
                                belligerent Government can take and they can be taken only after
                                full discussion between the political, military and naval advisers
                                of the various Allied Governments. It would be highly
                                unsatisfactory, and might be dangerous, to rely solely on cable
                                communication and diplomatic discussion at Washington <pb n="898"
                                    xml:id="pg_898" facs="0144"/>for the solution of problems which
                                will always be difficult and may, in the event of German
                                demonstrations become at any moment of the most vital urgency. The
                                avoidance of urgent crises will largely depend on the extent to
                                which the policy of the United States and the European Allies can be
                                given the appearance, as well as the substance, of steadiness and
                                continuity and for this the closest and most constant touch between
                                the United States and the situation in Northern Europe will be
                                absolutely indispensable. The British Government cannot therefore
                                over-emphasise the supreme importance they attach to the acceptance
                                by the United States of the invitation already extended to them to
                                send representatives to London competent to discuss all such matters
                                with the advisers, and if necessary with the cabinets, of the Allied
                                Governments, in order that the United States Government may be fully
                                informed, as they cannot otherwise be, not only of the economic
                                facts of war trade, but also of the strategic and political
                                situation with which those facts must be constantly adjusted.</p>

                                <p>The chairman stated that the meeting should be regarded as
                                    entirely unofficial. <persName

                                        Cecil</persName>, Minister of Blockade, had, however,
                                    authorised him to consult the members of the meeting with regard
                                    to certain proposals for tightening the financial blockade of
                                    the Central powers. Copies of the proposals which were, of
                                    course, subject to modification, were in the hands of those
                                    present, who would, no doubt, consult their respective
                                    Governments with regard to them. Unanimity and concerted action
                                    on the part of all the Governments was essential in action based
                                    upon the proposals.</p>
                                <p>It must be understood that so far the proposals had not been
                                    officially approved by His Majesty’s Government, and
                                    consultation with London bankers would also be necessary.</p>
                                <p>The action taken in the past with regard to the financial
                                    blockade by Great Britain and by France had not been altogether
                                    similar. In the main, the British authorities had not placed
                                    neutral banks upon the financial black list except where they
                                    had used their London accounts in connection with enemy
                                    transactions.</p>
                                <p>[The principle now invoked is similar to that already adopted and
                                    in force in regard to goods. As <persName

                                        Cecil</persName> stated in the House of Commons on March 27:
                                    “We can legitimately deprive the neutral country of certain
                                    advantages, and in consideration of our granting goods and other
                                    things that the neutral country wants from us, we ask them to
                                    restrict their trade with our enemies.”</p>

                                    individual banking institutions in neutral countries, using as a
                                    lever the use of the Allies’ banking facilities and the use of
                                    British-owned and other Allied cables. The weapon is a most
                                    trenchant one, seeing that the Allies now hold the financial
                                    centres and money markets of the world, and it is most essential
                                    that the weapon should be used, subject always to diplomatic
                                    considerations and to the balance between injury done to the
                                    enemy and injury done to ourselves.]<note n="1" xml:id="d45fn3"

                                <p>The French authorities have at times already exercised their
                                    power in this respect and have placed certain neutral banks upon
                                    their financial black list on the ground that they were heavily
                                    engaged in enemy transactions.</p>
                                <p>It may be noted further that whenever the British or the French
                                    authorities have taken action against neutral banks, either for
                                    involving the Allied banks in enemy transactions, or as in the
                                    case of the Banco Hispano Americano for merely having relations
                                    with the enemy, the result has almost always been that such
                                    neutral banks have been prepared to sign very stringent
                                    agreements as a condition of being removed from the black list,
                                    and of resuming relations with London and Paris.</p>
                                <p>The proposals now submitted represented a uniform and united
                                    extension on a large scale of the method employed by the French
                                    authorities in certain individual cases.</p>
                                <p>The recent fall of the mark in neutral European countries was,
                                    doubtless, in large part, due to the fact that Germany could no
                                    longer employ resources in the United States of America and
                                    South America, and her more favourable exchange with the United
                                    States of America, to acquire neutral European currencies
                                    wherewith to pay for her imports from neutral European
                                    countries.</p>
                                <p>It was believed that the steps proposed would lead to still
                                    heavier depreciation in the mark, injure Germany’s economic
                                    position seriously, and make it more costly for her to obtain
                                    supplies from neutral European countries.</p>
                                <p>It was believed that if the five countries acted in concert,
                                    neutral European, banks could not afford to refuse the
                                    limitations on transactions with and for the enemy suggested in
                                    these proposals, at the cost of losing access to the money
                                    markets of Paris, London, Milan, New York, and Petrograd. It
                                    should, however, be carefully noted that by the announcement
                                    proposed, the five Governments only “hold themselves at liberty”
                                    to take the action in question. This afforded a safeguard in the
                                    event of any general refusal on behalf of <pb n="901"
                                        xml:id="pg_901" facs="0147"/>neutral banks, or of
                                    inconvenient diplomatic pressure, or of it being desirable for
                                    an exception to be made in respect of any particular bank to
                                    whom any of the Governments are peculiarly beholden.</p>
                                <p>The chairman then put forward the considerations outlined in the
                                    attached general memorandum with regard to the suggested
                                    extension of the financial blockade.<note n="1" xml:id="d45fn4"

                                    to condition (1) in the proposals it would appear difficult to

                                    agreement.</p>
                                <p>The chairman assented to this view which was generally held.</p>
                                <p>Those present expressed a wish that a memorandum summarising what
                                    had passed at the meeting might be supplied to them for

                                assisting the enemy. The Department in its instruction states that
                                the question is being treated with the British mission, and that
                                data would be acceptable setting forth the operations of firms of
                                the character under consideration.</p>
                            <p>I learn from the Controller of Foreign Trade that he has provided the
                                British mission in Washington with duplicates of the reports in the
                                files in London, and he is prepared to supplement those reports with
                                later information as it is received, or to discuss any question of
                                detail arising out of the reports as they stand. In a further
                                private conversation with him he has expressed a very keen hope that
                                the Department will adopt the British point of view, and, in
                                particular, will issue a public announcement to this effect. He is
                                of the impression that a public statement of this character would
                                profoundly discourage the commercial classes in Germany who, he has
                                reason to believe, are much more seriously affected by the breaking
                                up of their foreign connections than is generally supposed to be the
                                case.</p>
                            <p>With respect to German firms established in the United States, the
                                Controller further expressed the view that sooner or later the <pb
                                    n="903" xml:id="pg_903" facs="0149"/>American Government would
                                find it necessary to close them up, and to liquidate their
                                outstanding business. As the Department is aware, this course was
                                followed in Great Britain after about two years’ agitation. When the
                                war began announcement was made that German concerns domiciled in
                                Great Britain would not be interfered with as long as they carried
                                on a merely domestic business, but as the months went by these
                                concerns became the targets for a campaign which terminated with
                                their liquidation. Unfortunately the liquidation itself, in
                                individual instances, provoked a good deal of criticism, perhaps
                                inseparable from an undertaking of this character.</p>

                            <p>8. First proclamation regarding control of exports has been noted in
                                conference with Ministry of Blockade. It is remarked that <pb
                                    n="906" xml:id="pg_906" facs="0152"/>prohibition does not
                                include such vitally important articles as rubber, oleaginous seeds,
                                animals, vegetables, waxes, chemicals, non-ferrous metals, ores and
                                alloys. The continued receipt of these articles enables Norway,
                                Sweden, Denmark, and Holland to continue exporting native produce to
                                the enemy. From private information placed at our disposal by
                                Foreign Office I am satisfied that only a complete prohibition of
                                all exports to these countries and Spain will cover the situation.
                                Are other prohibitions, having in view complete stoppage of exports
                                of war materials, from Sweden, expected shortly? Am I correct in
                                understanding that Exports Council will refuse license to export any
                                articles to Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Holland where navicert is
                                refused here because of character of consignee or because article is
                                embargoed or rationed by Great Britain notwithstanding article is
                                not on American prohibited list of exports?</p>

                                Gothenburg, Sweden, because of the fact that this concern is on a

                                subjects to have business, relations. You ask that a special permit

                            <p>It is obviously the prime duty of the United States to first furnish
                                food and supplies to the Allies and for this purpose the American
                                people are undertaking the utmost endeavor and self-sacrifice.
                                Therefore, for the United States to undertake the supply of neutrals
                                it must mean in many commodities alternatively either a deprivation
                                of the Allies, further sacrifice upon the part of the American
                                people, or a diversion of labor and productivity from the
                                necessities of war.</p>
                            <p>The war has, however, been entered upon by the American people not
                                for any national gain, but in the hope that through the sacrifice of
                                its manhood and resources, the integrity of neutral nations can be
                                established free from jeopardy and beyond this, every sense of
                                humanity and uninterrupted friendship gives the American people the
                                greatest concern in the well-being of the people of Denmark.</p>
                            <p>In consequence it is believed that the American people will undertake
                                further sacrifice and more extraordinary endeavors to increase their
                                exportable balance. Nevertheless, it is but fair that the people of
                                Denmark should exchange services of equal value in promoting the
                                well-being of the people of the United States. Furthermore, it would
                                seem proper that the sacrifices of the American people should not be
                                directly or indirectly turned to the advantage of the enemy by the
                                people of Denmark. Therefore, in order to secure such arrangements
                                as a safeguard that the sacrifices of the American <pb n="909"
                                    xml:id="pg_909" facs="0155"/>people shall not have been in vain,
                                it is hoped that the following notes will obtain earnest
                                consideration by the Royal Government.</p>

                                <item>That every possible effort shall have been made by the Royal
                                    Danish Government to stimulate production of foodstuffs, sea
                                    food and other commodities within their own borders and to have
                                    secured all available supplies from other quarters abroad and to
                                    have regulated consumption with the utmost rigidity by the
                                    elimination of wastes and excess consumption of every character.
                                    It can hardly be expected that superlabor and self-denial will
                                    be made by the American people unless the most intense efforts
                                    in these directions will also be made by the people of
                                    Denmark.</item>

                                <item>In the situation of insufficient supplies for ourselves and
                                    the cobelligerents alone, the American people cannot be expected
                                    to part with food supplies other than in such a minimum amount
                                    as will make up the deficiency in the food values arising after
                                    the most intensive endeavors as above. In the determination of
                                    this minimum, it is felt that the pre-war imports are no longer
                                    a criterion of the necessities because more intense production
                                    and the reduced consumption render such calculations wholly
                                    inapplicable. In this sense it appears that the food resources
                                    of Denmark should be at once calculated as to their value in
                                    protein, fat, and carbohydrates, and that the consumption should
                                    be calculated upon a standard intake per capita of these
                                    fundamental requisites. Upon the completion of these
                                    calculations it should be evident the amount of deficiency in
                                    each of the three particulars which must be supplied abroad and
                                    it will also appear in which of these three great food
                                    requisites Denmark produces a surplus. In order to arrive at
                                    these calculations the United State Government would be glad to
                                    establish an agent to Denmark to confer with the Danish
                                    authorities.</item>

                                <item>In this situation of inadequate supply of commodities it is
                                    obvious that the question of price is entirely of secondary
                                    importance to the commodities themselves. Furthermore, the
                                    possession of these commodities is of the utmost importance in
                                    the entire strategy and conduct of the war, and if the American
                                    people are to part with their supplies to the prejudice of their
                                    own interests and of those people who are enemies of the Central
                                    Empires, this service given to the people of Denmark by the
                                    people of America cannot be wholly liquidated by the purchase
                                    price, and some service in return, either to the American people
                                    or to the Allies, of relative value to that afforded by the
                                    American people, should be furnished.</item>

                                <item>It is obvious that the prevention of supplies of all kinds
                                    reaching the enemy is of vital interest to the United States,
                                    and therefore the shipment of foodstuffs from Denmark to Germany
                                    is of the utmost concern to the American people. It appears a
                                    right assumption in consequence that the Royal Government will
                                    undertake to <pb n="910" xml:id="pg_910" facs="0156"/>exclude
                                    any suggestion that American protein, fat or carbohydrate or

                                    from Denmark.</item>

                                <item>It is held strongly in the United States that conversion to
                                    the enemy’s use is not alone the direct transmission of original
                                    American commodities, but also the conversion, directly or
                                    indirectly, into other commodities exported to Germany or used
                                    in manufacture of such commodities, or substitution directly or
                                    indirectly for products of Denmark which may be exported to
                                    Germany. A case in point is the import of feeding stuffs from
                                    the United States to Denmark and the re-export of protein and
                                    fat values to Germany created by their use. And in fact the
                                    re-transmission of food values in these circumstances is even
                                    greater disaster to American interest than if the original
                                    feeding stuffs were sent straightway to the enemy, as it thus
                                    means not only that American products but Danish labor are being
                                    supplied to the enemy. On the other hand the American people do
                                    not wish to depart from the high standards of humanity they have
                                    set throughout the war and are disposed to consider any
                                    reasonable and effective method by which Danish products,
                                    derived from sources not American, are applied to purely
                                    humanitarian purposes of adding to the supply for women and
                                    children even in the enemy’s territory.</item>

                                <item>As a result of the large depletion of the food resources of
                                    the United States from the 1916 harvest, the United States
                                    Government finds that the position of its people between now and
                                    the arrival of the new harvest requires its very serious
                                    attention and therefore the immediate situation is one requiring

                            <p>5236. I had a conversation to-day by appointment with the British
                                Ambassador, <persName corresp="frus1917Supp02v01#p_CSR1">Sir Richard
                                    Crawford</persName>, and <persName

                                Percy</persName>, in regard to the effect of the United States
                                embargo on exports to the European neutrals. Each neutral was taken
                                up in turn and its relations to the Allies and to Germany in respect
                                to exports, imports, trade agreements, military possibilities, etc.,
                                were discussed. I pointed out that the United States was about to
                                formulate a policy on the subject, but that it was embarrassed in
                                doing so by not having formal, authoritative statements from the
                                British and French Governments as to certain important points which
                                appear to have been but vaguely or partially touched upon in the
                                memoranda and interviews of members of the embassies. Indeed, some
                                of the opinions and statements made from time to time seem to me
                                somewhat inconsistent or at variance with each other. It seems that
                                these matters should be cleared up at the earliest moment by frank
                                and full exchange of views. Out of the discussion the following
                                questions arose, upon which I asked the Ambassador to obtain an
                                authoritative expression of views by his Government, for our

                                <item>What are the agreements Great Britain has with the northern
                                    neutrals, and what France has with Switzerland? We have not been
                                    furnished with copies of these agreements, but have simply been
                                    given general statements regarding them. We feel that we should
                                    know exactly the provisions of the agreements which may be
                                    broken by our embargo before it is made complete.</item>

                                <item>Is Great Britain willing, and does she desire, to break these
                                    agreements with the neutrals? The United States probably would
                                    not be willing to appear to cause the Allies to break these
                                    agreements, unless it is understood officially that such action
                                    is acceptable to and desired by Great Britain and France. On the
                                    other hand, the United States would be placed in a peculiar
                                    position if it refused to allow wheat, for example, to go to
                                    Holland, while Great Britain freely shipped rice to that country
                                    under special agreements. If it seems best that the agreements
                                    should be terminated, the responsibility should be shared with
                                    the United States by the Allies.</item>

                                <item>Are Great Britain, France, and Italy willing to forego the
                                    supplies or facilities which they are now obtaining from the
                                    neutrals in case these are cut off by the neutrals as a direct
                                    or indirect result of the embargo?</item>
                                <label>4.</label>
                                <item>Are the Allies prepared to meet, with such aid as the United
                                    States could supply at the moment, the military situation should
                                    Germany attack the neutrals or establish bases on their
                                    territory or coasts or otherwise use the neutrals to serve
                                    directly its military ends? The responsibility for bringing
                                    about so serious a situation and meeting it should be in
                                    common.</item>

                                <item>What are the demands which Great Britain and France desire
                                    should be made upon the neutrals? Are all exports to Germany to
                                    be cut off? Is the use of neutral shipping to be demanded, and
                                    to what extent?</item>
                            </list>
                            <p>The responsibility for the effects of a drastic embargo should be
                                clearly understood before action is taken, the probable effects upon
                                supplies to Germany and the Allies and upon the military situation
                                should be carefully worked out, the preparations necessary to meet
                                and nullify these results, and the extent to which we and the Allies
                                are willing to bear the burden of possible military and naval
                                operations should be duly weighed and decided upon in advance.</p>
                            <p>I told the Ambassador that I was very anxious to have definite and
                                official answers to these inquiries after they had been considered
                                technically by British authorities to submit to the Exports Council
                                before this Government could consider and possibly recommend the
                                drastic demands which it is understood the Allies desire us to make
                                on the European neutrals.<note n="1" xml:id="d58fn1">For a partial

                                exported without restrictions. Besides this 15 per cent, it is worth
                                noting that the agreement provides that should there cease to be
                                purchasers in Norway for any of the following classes of products
                                the prohibition of export may be removed from such class, viz.,
                                herrings, fresh and salted; wet and dry salted fish and dried fish
                                of various specified kinds; cod oil; herring oil; seal oil; roes and
                                herring and fish meal. In order to provide for the purchase of the

                                convenient at this moment that I should summarise the state of our
                                negotiations with various neutral countries as to tonnage, since I
                                am afraid that the information which we have supplied you in the
                                past was partly given verbally, and that we have never given you a
                                compendious statement to which you can easily refer. In what follows
                                I have ignored the complicated questions of the Spanish and Japanese
                                tonnage. The Spanish tonnage situation remains in the same condition
                                as when Mr. <persName corresp="frus1917Supp02v01#p_BAJ1"

                                <hi rend="italic">Norway</hi>. The substance of the arrangement
                                proposed by the British Government was that British vessels should
                                be substituted for Norwegian vessels in the Anglo-Norwegian trade
                                and that the Norwegian vessels should be taken over to run in Allied
                                trades; that we should give the Norwegian vessels thus taken over a
                                generous rate, while the British ships substituted for them should
                                be run at cost, thus reducing the price of coal to Norway probably
                                from about £12 to about £7 a ton; that Great Britain should
                                guarantee to produce and license for export Norway’s full
                                requirements of coal and coke; and that in return for these
                                concessions on the part of the British Government all Norwegian
                                ships not already trading to an Allied country or engaged in
                                carriage of essential goods to Norway should be transferred to
                                Allied service.</p>
                            <p>The Norwegian Government informed the British Minister at Christiania
                                at the end of April that they assented in principle to these
                                proposals. On July 6th the Foreign Office cabled to me that the
                                agreement was now practically completed and that the British
                                Government were proceeding with the execution of various provisions
                                of it.</p>
                            <p>

                                <hi rend="italic">Denmark</hi>. Within the last month an agreement
                                has been definitely concluded of which the following are the main
                                points:</p>
                            <p>Export to Denmark from the United Kingdom in Danish vessels of
                                100,000 tons of coal a month so long as 200,000 tons dead weight of
                                Danish shipping are chartered to the British Government for trade in
                                European waters. Rates of hire and war risk are provided for, and
                                the British Government state their willingness to provide British
                                crews for Danish vessels time-chartered to them.</p>
                            <p>Danish vessels of 500 tons dead weight and over, other than those
                                engaged in trade between Denmark, Iceland and the Faroe Islands, and
                                those chartered as above, will engage in trades of interest to the
                                Allies, including the carriage of cargoes for the Commission for
                                Relief in Belgium. Charters of such vessels to be approved by the
                                International <pb n="917" xml:id="pg_917" facs="0163"/>Chartering
                                Executive, and no Danish vessel to be laid up or withdrawn from
                                trade except with the concurrence of the British Government.</p>
                            <p>Danish vessels proceeding to South Atlantic, West Indian and Gulf
                                ports or to the East via the Panama Canal should perform
                                intermediate service; e. g., by loading outward cargoes at United
                                States ports. For this purpose space is to be chartered through the
                                International Chartering Executive. Examination at Halifax or other
                                British ports to be expedited in the case of Danish ships whose
                                cargoes have already been approved.</p>
                            <p>Special provision is made for Danish sailing vessels continuing to
                                trade between America and Denmark. If proceeding to the South
                                Atlantic they are to perform intermediate service in the same way as
                                the steamships mentioned above. These provisions for intermediate
                                service are intended to provide cargo space from the United States
                                to South America. A monthly statement is to be furnished of the
                                position and trading of all Danish vessels of over 500 tons dead
                                weight, including sailing vessels.</p>
                            <p>The Foreign Office cabled me on July 6th that this arrangement has
                                been accepted by the Danish shipowners and is in force.</p>

                                however, been made with one Swedish line; namely, the Swedish
                                Transatlantic Steamship Co. A memorandum dated July 26th, regarding
                                this agreement was sent to Mr. <persName

                                <hi rend="italic">Holland</hi>. The Dutch Government have
                                communicated to the British Government a statement intended to
                                justify the present position of Dutch tonnage. We do not regard this
                                statement as at all satisfactory, but the Foreign Office and the
                                Ministry of Shipping are still examining it and I have not yet
                                received their detailed views. No agreement as yet exists in regard
                                to Dutch shipping, but a <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> was
                                provisionally arrived at about two months ago providing for the
                                performance by Dutch ships proceeding to the South Atlantic or to
                                the Far East via the Panama Canal of intermediate service by the
                                carriage of coal from the United States to the Canal or other
                                coaling stations. You will remember that I informed you of this
                                arrangement at the time, and that we have more than once invited
                                your views as to the cargoes which Dutch ships should be required to
                                carry for the benefit of the United States, both on their voyage
                                from Holland and in the way of intermediate service.<note n="2"

                                as the Government of the United States is already fully informed as
                                to our desire to discuss the needs of the United States and the
                                Allies and to provide for their satisfaction, and I think it is
                                clearly understood that in all provisions of these agreements,
                                referring specifically to the British Government the latter acts not
                                on its own behalf but as the agent of its associates. The Swedish
                                and Dutch tonnage problems still remain for settlement, but the
                                British Government, again acting not merely on its own behalf, but
                                as agent for its associates, has made proposals, expressed opinions
                                and assumed an attitude which we are sure our associates will take
                                into account.</p>
                            <p>I hope this explains the position adequately, but if you wish any
                                further information I need hardly say that I shall be only too glad
                                to furnish it.</p>
                            <p>In general it may be of interest to explain that the two main
                                concessions by which the British Government have obtained the
                                Norwegian and Danish agreements and are seeking to obtain agreements
                                with Holland and Sweden, are the export of British coal to those
                                countries and the granting of permission to their ships to call at
                                ports such as Halifax and Kingston outside the danger zone. To these
                                concessions has been added, in the case of Norway, the very
                                important concession that Norwegian ships are relieved of the most
                                dangerous North Sea trade by British ships.</p>

                                has been carrying on informal discussions with representatives of
                                neutrals adjacent to Germany in connection as to their needs. He is
                                primarily seeking information for the guidance of Exports Council.
                                In connection with discussions he gave following memorandum to
                                representatives:</p>

                            <p>The above memorandum sent for your confidential information and
                                guidance in discussing this question. It will probably be sent to
                                the various neutral governments by their representatives here. No
                                definite policy has as yet been established. Informal discussions
                                with the neutrals still being carried on and this Government is
                                securing the views of Great Britain and France as to (1) whether
                                trade between Germany and neutrals should be entirely prohibited;
                                (2) if the United States takes this position whether Great Britain
                                and France will cancel outstanding agreements with neutrals, and (3)
                                whether the Allies are prepared to meet such military emergency as
                                may arise as result of cutting off neutrals refusing to [stop] trade
                                with Germany. No definite policy settled.</p>

                                </hi>: You spoke to me this morning about the telegram which
                                    <persName corresp="frus1917Supp02v01#p_CSR1">Crawford</persName>
                                showed you yesterday on the subject of the restriction of neutral
                                exports to Germany. I understood from <persName
                                    corresp="frus1917Supp02v01#p_CSR1">Crawford</persName> that
                                doubts were raised as to certain points in this telegram, and I am
                                trying to clear these points up with the Foreign Office by cable. It
                                may perhaps be best, in these circumstances, to postpone putting
                                this telegram on record until these points are cleared up.</p>
                            <p>I am, however, now in a position at least to put clearly the point of
                                principle regarding our willingness to go as far as you in the
                                directions we have suggested and to revise our existing agreements
                                with neutrals where such revision is necessary. In order to have
                                this definitely on record, I have written the enclosed official note
                                which embodies the most important part of the telegram.</p>
                            <p>The points remaining to be cleared up are ones of procedure and I
                                have indicated them at the end of the penultimate paragraph of <pb
                                    n="921" xml:id="pg_921" facs="0167"/>the enclosed note. The main
                                point raised by the telegram is that Denmark and Holland sent us
                                40,000,000 sterling worth of food last year, that we are willing to
                                forego all this food except the Dutch margarine which we now get in
                                return for Dutch imports of various oils and fats, but that if it is
                                cut off from us before Denmark and Holland give way to our proposed
                                demands, it will probably be diverted to Germany, and we therefore
                                doubt whether it is wise, not from the point of view of maintaining
                                our own food supplies but from the point of view of restricting
                                those of the enemy, for us to invite such retaliatory action by
                                appearing too prominently in the initial step of presenting the
                                proposed demands to these neutrals, however strongly and completely
                                we are prepared to support you in those demands. I hope it may be
                                possible to give this point the most careful consideration, and, if
                                you think there is something in it, you will perhaps be able to
                                suggest some method by which we can identify ourselves with your
                                policy without weakening the first step you take.</p>

                                <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: It is a matter of the gravest concern
                                to His Majesty’s Government, at the present time, that supplies of
                                monetary credit—one of the most vital forms of all aids—continue to
                                reach the enemy through neutral countries, as it cannot be doubted
                                that aid in this form must prolong the war, and so be the direct
                                cause of further loss of life and unnecessary suffering.</p>
                            <p>As you are well aware, the enemy has only four possible methods by
                                which he can pay for the supplies of goods and other aids which he
                                    <pb n="925" xml:id="pg_925" facs="0171"/>obtains from neutral
                                countries. These are (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) to export goods or
                                services; (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) to export gold; (<hi
                                    rend="italic">c</hi>) to obtain credits from neutrals; (<hi
                                    rend="italic">d</hi>) to realise his existing investments in
                                neutral countries.</p>
                            <p>It is obvious that if it is possible to prevent the enemy obtaining
                                credit from neutrals or realising his investments through them, he
                                will be driven, either to export more goods (which will be
                                difficult) or to export gold (which it is unlikely that he will dare
                                to do in sufficient quantity) or finally to decrease or cease his
                                purchases abroad. His Majesty’s Government therefore consider that
                                the moment has come for bringing pressure to bear upon neutrals in
                                order to deter them from rendering financial assistance to the
                                enemy, and they suggest the use for this purpose of the very
                                powerful weapon which the Allies possess in the control of the
                                paramount financial markets of New York, London and Paris, as well
                                as Milan and Petrograd.</p>
                            <p>His Majesty’s Government propose that a notice should be issued in
                                the neutral European press in the following terms:<note n="1"

                                am informed was telegraphed by him to the Washington Embassy some

                                    discussion, is printed.</note> If there remain any points which
                                are <pb n="928" xml:id="pg_928" facs="0174"/>not clear or if any new
                                questions have arisen with relation to our share in the blockade, I
                                await your further instructions. The Embassy is in close touch with
                                the Ministry of Blockade which is apparently at pains to keep me
                                informed as to new developments. One suggestion which has just been
                                made by <persName corresp="frus1917Supp02v01#p_CLR1"
                                    >Cecil</persName> may be worth emphasizing here. The British
                                Government is quite willing that an Allied blockade council should
                                be set up in Washington and to send delegates to sit in it if
                                desired. On the other hand if our authorities prefer not to be bound
                                by the decisions of a council whose nature might be taken as that of
                                an official inter-Allied body, the British Government is willing to
                                send over men familiar with all phases of the blockade if these men
                                are asked for by our Government. In that case they would come merely
                                in a consultative capacity and their instructions would be to assist
                                the American Government with information as required. I think many
                                grim difficulties would be overcome by the presence of such
                                assistants. I am assured that the French would co-operate in
                                this.</p>

                            <p>The British Government understands that the Government of the United
                                States wishes to secure identity of policy between the two
                                Governments in matters of export restrictions. For this purpose two
                                distinct measures appear to be necessary, namely: <list>
                                    <label>(1)</label>
                                    <item>The co-ordination of the licensing policy of the two

                                    <label>(2)</label>
                                    <item>The co-ordination of that licensing policy with the naval
                                        action of the two Governments under international maritime
                                        law.</item>
                                </list>
                            </p>
                            <p>As regards (1) the British Government has suspended licenses for
                                export from the United Kingdom on all articles embargoed by the
                                Government of the United States and will continue to do so as the
                                United States list of prohibited exports is enlarged. Before,
                                however, complete co-ordination can take place it will be necessary
                                that the prohibited exports lists of the two Governments shall be
                                made as nearly as possible identical. The British list now covers
                                practically all articles whatever, so far as the northern European
                                neutrals are concerned. When the two lists are identical, the
                                British Government will wish to continue certain exports to the
                                northern neutrals from the United Kingdom, the most important of
                                which are coal to Norway and Denmark, munition materials to firms
                                manufacturing munitions for the Allies in Norway and Sweden,
                                margarine materials to Holland <pb n="929" xml:id="pg_929"
                                    facs="0175"/>in return for Dutch margarine exported to the
                                United Kingdom, and possibly certain textile goods, etc., exported
                                to these neutrals for the purpose of maintaining exchange to
                                counterbalance expenditures in purchasing the native produce of
                                these neutrals, these expenditures being at present necessary, in
                                the absence of proper prohibitions of export in these neutral
                                countries, in order to keep the produce from flowing to Germany.
                                These continued exports the British Government wishes however to
                                submit to the Government of the United States for their opinion and
                                judgment. Consultation will be necessary for this purpose and, in so
                                far as this consultation involves the expression of an opinion by
                                the Government of the United States on the export policy of Great
                                Britain, the British Government would be glad of an opportunity for
                                regular consultation in London. The same applies to the export
                                policy of the other European Allies, notably the export policy of
                                Russia as towards Sweden and that of Italy towards Switzerland.
                                (Swiss questions are centered in Paris, not London.) It is assumed
                                that the Government of the United States—the United States being now
                                by far the largest exporter to these neutral countries—will wish
                                similarly to consider the grant of certain licenses for export from
                                the United States, either for reasons of domestic policy or because
                                they consider that such exports will be advisable on international
                                grounds. They will doubtless be willing to discuss their policy in
                                this respect and for this purpose the British Government will make
                                adequate provision for such consultation at Washington, if the
                                Government of the United States so desires.</p>
                            <p>As regards (2), naval action is at present embodied in two British
                                measures—the issue of letters of assurance and the examination of
                                ships at Halifax or Kingston. Letters of assurance are a substitute
                                for export licenses in the case of goods not yet subject to license,
                                and also a passport for the guidance of the naval officer at the
                                port of examination. In the first aspect, their purpose will vanish
                                when the United States list of prohibited exports is made
                                comprehensive, and when the co-ordination of the export policy of
                                the two Governments has been attained, by consultation in London and
                                Washington. In the second aspect, their fate depends to a certain
                                extent on the decision as to the continuance of naval examination at
                                Halifax and Kingston. That examination has three objects: (1) the
                                search of the ship for the purpose of detecting smuggling,
                                conveyance of clandestine correspondence, and undesirable passengers
                                or members of the crew, etc., etc.; (2) the use of detention of
                                ships at the port of examination as a lever to enforce proper
                                behaviour on the part of neutrals; and (3) any detention necessary
                                in connection with naval and military operation, especially in the
                                North Sea or Mediterranean. The abandonment of such examination
                                cannot, therefore, well take place until (1) arrangements can <pb
                                    n="930" xml:id="pg_930" facs="0176"/>be made for thorough
                                examination at the port of departure, this examination including not
                                only the checking of the cargo, but a thorough search of the ship
                                herself, satisfactory to the naval as well as to the customs
                                authorities, on the basis of proper interchange of information
                                between the Intelligence Departments of the Governments concerned;
                                (2) the provision of some machinery for co-ordinating, the
                                international, as well as the domestic export, policy of those
                                associated in the war against Germany; and (3) full interchange of
                                information as to naval and military operations. (1) and (3) need no
                                further discussion, though the setting up of much complicated
                                machinery is clearly required. In regard to (2) the following points
                                should be borne in mind. This department of international policy
                                requires not only economic knowledge, but also the fullest
                                information as to the political, naval and military situation in
                                Europe. As methods of consultation in London and Washington have
                                been proposed above, corresponding respectively to the discussion of
                                British and Allied export policy and of United States export policy,
                                so similar dual methods of consultation appear advisable for the
                                discussion of those aspects of international policy involved
                                respectively in the detention of neutral ships by the British naval
                                forces and in the grant of clearance papers to neutral ships by the
                                Government of the United States. Further, it must be remembered that
                                the call at Halifax is imposed on ships coming from other than
                                United States ports, notably ships coming from the Plate, and the
                                British Government would be glad to agree with the United States
                                Government as to the method by which such ships should be now
                                controlled. It is clear that examination at Halifax may still be
                                necessary for naval and military reasons, even after the economic
                                policy of the two Governments has been fully co-ordinated, until
                                such time as adequate naval and military co-ordination can be
                                secured. But even if this is the case, the British Government stands
                                ready, as was explained to the Department of State about the
                                beginning of June, to give an assurance to neutrals that, except for
                                naval and military reasons, ships whose cargo has been approved at
                                the port of departure shall not be detained at Halifax more than
                                (say) from twenty-four to forty-eight hours.</p>
                            <p>To sum up, as soon as an understanding is arrived at as to the policy
                                to be pursued by the United States, the British Government will be
                                prepared to consider in a spirit of co-operation how the existing
                                machinery of blockade, including examination at Halifax, can be
                                modified and replaced by measures which would be enforced by the
                                United States Government in the common interests of the nations
                                associated in the war against Germany. For its part, the British
                                Government defines its policy as a complete stoppage of exports from
                                all Allied European countries to these neutrals with the exceptions
                                noted above; the submission of these exceptions to <pb n="931"
                                    xml:id="pg_931" facs="0177"/>the informed judgment of the United
                                States Government; and the assumption of identical responsibility
                                with the United States Government in demanding that the border
                                neutrals shall stop exports to Germany, maintain exports to the
                                Allies, put their ships into service and adopt, in all such matters
                                as transit, etc., a policy consonant with the principles of
                                international comity.</p>

                            <p>The British Government have proposed close consultation between
                                British and American representatives on the whole subject of exports
                                to neutral countries contiguous to Germany.</p>
                            <p>It is important to make it clear that such consultation is proposed
                                solely in order that each representative may severally furnish
                                information to his Government and make his recommendations to them
                                for their independent consideration and decision.</p>
                            <p>The respective Governments would keep in their own hands the
                                regulation of their own export policy. In so far, however, as that
                                policy is directed to the achievement of a common result it is
                                submitted that the deliberations of each of the associated
                                Governments preceding its determination should be based on a common
                                stock of knowledge of all the considerations which weigh with the
                                other and such common knowledge can be best obtained by consultation
                                and interchange of information.</p>
                            <p>For example, the British Government do not wish to issue export
                                licenses, still less to initiate agreements with, or put pressure
                                upon, neutral countries without giving the United States Government
                                an opportunity to express an opinion and they hope that the latter
                                wish similarly to keep in touch with them. Above all, in so far as
                                imports into neutral countries are controlled by the British Navy,
                                they do not wish to exercise such control as against the United
                                States or in contradiction to the export policy which the United
                                States may see fit to adopt in any given case.</p>
                            <p>For the last few months the British Government have made every effort
                                to keep the Government of the United States informed through their
                                representatives at Washington of every phase of British policy
                                towards the border neutrals. They have sought by means of numerous
                                formal and informal conferences to explain their policy, to invite
                                discussion and suggestions and, above all, to subordinate their
                                blockade operations to any export policy which the United States
                                Government may define and declare. Pending, however, the provision
                                of machinery for closer consultation they still issue or refuse
                                letters <pb n="932" xml:id="pg_932" facs="0178"/>of assurance at
                                their own discretion only; they still detain or release ships at
                                Halifax; they are daily, in the course of current negotiations with
                                neutrals, making concessions or insisting upon demands which may
                                alike affect the duration and the success of the war. If they have
                                informed the United States Government of these steps, they have,
                                they fear, failed to convey such information at the only moment when
                                the United States Government could make use of it—namely, at the
                                moment when policy was in course of deliberation. It is in this way
                                that misunderstandings are likely to be avoided and coordination of
                                effort secured, wherever necessary, without surrender of independent
                                control. So long, indeed, as the United States Government is without
                                the fuller knowledge to be acquired by direct examination in London
                                of circumstances and considerations influencing the policy of the
                                British Government, the actions of the latter must frequently appear
                                unexpected and inexplicable to the authorities at Washington, who
                                cannot imitate them without a sacrifice of discretion or diverge
                                from them without a sacrifice of efficiency.</p>
                            <p>These considerations apply especially to the information now desired
                                by the United States authorities as to the limits set to diplomatic
                                and economic pressure on neutrals by naval and military plans and
                                contingencies. The British Government hope to be able shortly to
                                convey to the United States the views of their military and naval
                                advisers, but these views, so conveyed, can be nothing but an
                                approximate forecast based on estimates which may at any moment be
                                falsified. The policy of the Allies towards Sweden in blockade
                                matters was, for instance, suddenly and radically altered in 1915 by
                                the unexpected extent of the Russian retreat and, short of such
                                major changes in the strategic situation, the choice by Germany of a
                                passing moment, particularly favourable to herself, for forcing an
                                issue with any one of the border neutrals, might at any time cause
                                the Allied General Staffs to recommend temporization where they had
                                originally been in favour of adopting a firm attitude. This is
                                particularly the case where naval considerations are involved, by
                                reason of the greater obscurity which necessarily surrounds the
                                naval plans of the Allies at any given moment. It is difficult to
                                gain any true idea of such shades of opinion except by personal
                                cross-questioning of experts.</p>
                            <p>The British Government cannot conceal their feeling that, in the
                                present situation, the countries associated in the war against
                                Germany can, in matters of war trade, neither avoid friction with
                                each other nor ensure a fair treatment of neutrals. Consequently,
                                they propose: <list>

                            <p>President to-day issued proclamation concerning control exports from
                                America giving lists articles which may be exported only under
                                license under two categories, first, exports to the enemy and his
                                allies and to neutral countries of Europe and secondly to all other
                                countries. Proclamation is accompanied by following explanatory
                                statement by the President: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>The purpose and effect of this proclamation is not export
                                        prohibition but merely export control. It is not the
                                        intention to interfere unnecessarily with our foreign trade
                                        but our own domestic needs must be adequately safeguarded
                                        and there is the added duty of meeting the necessities of
                                        all the nations at war with the Imperial German Government.
                                        After those needs are met it is our wish and intention to
                                        minister to the needs of the neutral nations as far as our
                                        resources permit. This task will be discharged without other
                                        than the very proper qualification that the liberation of
                                        our surplus products shall not be made the occasion of
                                        benefit to the enemy either directly or indirectly. The two
                                        lists have been prepared in the interests of <pb n="938"
                                            xml:id="pg_938" facs="0184"/>facility and expediency.
                                        The first list, applicable to the enemy and his allies and
                                        to the neutral countries of Europe, brings under control
                                        practically all articles of commerce while the second list,
                                        applicable to all other countries of the world, makes only a
                                        few additions to the list of commodities controlled by the
                                        proclamation of July 9, 1917. It is obvious that a closer
                                        supervision and control of exports is necessary with respect
                                        to those European neutrals within the sphere of hostilities
                                        than is required for those countries farther removed. The
                                        establishment of these distinctions will simplify the
                                        administrative processes and enable us to continue our
                                        policy of minimizing the interruption of trade. No licenses
                                        will be necessary for the exportation of coin, bullion,
                                        currency, and evidences of indebtedness until required by
                                        regulations to be promulgated by the Secretary of the
                                        Treasury in his discretion. <persName

                                British Ambassador stating in substance that the British Government
                                considers that the time has come for bringing such pressure upon
                                neutrals as will deter them from rendering financial assistance to
                                the enemy and setting forth the means suggested by the Governments
                                mentioned in your letter for bringing the matter into effect.<note

                            <p>In response to your request for expression of my views at the
                                earliest practicable moment, I beg to advise as follows.</p>
                            <p>The Department of Commerce regards it as supremely important to cut
                                off as fully and promptly as possible the enemy’s supplies of
                                credit. Without credit and credit facilities the enemy cannot
                                purchase needed supplies even if those supplies exist and no other
                                obstruction prevents his securing them. If the means of paying for
                                purchases are gone the possibility of making purchases is indeed
                                remote.</p>
                            <p>Without entering into the more minute details of the memorandum
                                (concerning which details it is respectfully suggested that the
                                Secretary of the Treasury or the chairman of the Federal Reserve
                                Board is more competent to speak with authority than this
                                Department) the object sought therein is one that it is necessary to
                                obtain if at all possible, the means are deemed legitimate and the
                                proposed course in very large measure practicable. I am not prepared
                                to discuss the question as to whether under existing law authority
                                exists to take the proposed course.</p>

                            <p>I understand the British proposition to be substantially as follows:
                                    <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>That the United States should direct its citizens and banking
                                        houses in the United States to discontinue all intercourse,
                                        direct or indirect, with any banking house in another
                                        country which has any dealings with that class of persons
                                        defined as “enemy” by the United States; in other words, if
                                        a Brazilian bank A in Brazil should deal with B a German
                                        doing business within Brazil and also within Germany (and
                                        therefore an “enemy”), the United States should direct a
                                        United States citizen C to have no dealings with the
                                        Brazilian bank A.</p>
                                </quote>
                            </p>
                            <p>The mere statement of the proposition, in my opinion, demonstrates
                                the inadvisability of any assent by the United States to such a
                                course of action. It would amount clearly to the most extreme form
                                of black list of citizens of neutral nations—restricting American
                                dealings with such neutral citizens simply because the latter might
                                also be entering into transactions with German enemies perfectly
                                legitimate under the law of the neutral nation. Of course, if the
                                trade was to be carried on by a United States citizen with a neutral
                                citizen as an indirect means of trading with the German enemy, it
                                would be unlawful, under the law of the United States as at present
                                constituted, and would be a criminal transaction under the terms of
                                the pending Trading with the Enemy bill.</p>
                            <p>I can not believe that it would be wise or just for this Government
                                to assent to the proposition laid before you by the British
                                Embassy.</p>

                                promptly adopted and applied, they will have a powerful effect in

                                acknowledge receipt of your communication of the 28th of August,
                                enclosing copy of a note from the British Ambassador stating that
                                his Government considers that the time has come for bringing
                                pressure to bear upon neutrals in order to deter them from rendering
                                financial assistance to the enemy.</p>
                            <p>It seems not improbable that, to a considerable extent, the objects
                                of the publications proposed by the British Government to be made in
                                certain neutral countries can be attained by a control of foreign
                                    <pb n="943" xml:id="pg_943" facs="0189"/>exchange and the
                                transmittal of various forms of commercial paper. Such control is
                                now about to be established under recent proclamation of the
                                President, that proclamation being based upon the authority granted
                                to the President by an act of Congress known as the Espionage
                                Act.</p>
                            <p>In going beyond the limits which could be attained in the method just
                                indicated, it may be that such grave questions of international
                                relationship would be raised that a policy in respect to these
                                should first be determined before intelligent study could be given
                                to the details of the plan proposed by the British Government. If I
                                am advised by you that it is desired that the extreme steps proposed
                                by that Government should be taken by this Government, and no
                                question of neutral rights would be involved in a way to which you
                                would object, I will be glad to make a recommendation as to the
                                advisability, from the point of view of this Department, of the
                                additional value obtained from the proposed steps in our endeavors
                                to diminish the commerce of the enemy over those obtainable under
                                existing legislation.</p>

                            <p>The Exports Administrative Board, in accordance with requests made by
                                the United States Shipping Board and by the Navy Department, has
                                instructed the Director of the Bureau of Export Licenses not to
                                grant licenses for any proposed shipments by sailing vessels going
                                through the war zone. It is, of course, obvious that steamers <pb
                                    n="947" xml:id="pg_947" facs="0193"/>can navigate the war zone
                                with less danger than slow-sailing craft, and sailing ships, if used
                                in safer waters, would to an extent release steam vessels now used
                                in such waters.</p>
                            <p>The attention of shippers is, therefore, called to the fact that
                                clearance will be refused sailing vessels destined to proceed
                                through the war zone regardless of the fact that the goods
                                themselves may have already been licensed. Licenses will be granted
                                in the future for shipments to European countries only on condition
                                that the goods are to be shipped by some vessel other than a sailing
                                vessel. The board will revoke licenses covering goods to be shipped
                                through the war zone if any shippers attempt to ship them by sailing
                                vessel.</p>

                                    Wednesday and submit to you from time to time lists of subjects
                                    so that you or other members of the board or the board as a

                                    Does the United States Government desire to see these agreements
                                    denounced, and if so, do they agree to the forms of denunciation
                                    proposed?</p>
                                <p>2. The agreement between the British Government and the Danish
                                    associations may make it difficult for the former to take action
                                    in stopping Danish imports from neutral countries. They propose
                                    to make a communication to the associations with a view to keep
                                    the agreement alive but to state frankly that they can not
                                    continue to guarantee the free entry of goods covered by the
                                    agreement, so long as pending negotiations between the Danish
                                    and the United States Governments have not reached a
                                    satisfactory conclusion. Do the United States Government
                                    agree?</p>
                                <p>3. The British Government attaches the utmost importance to
                                    Switzerland receiving the full amount of 30,000 tons of oil cake
                                    for which they are asking.</p>
                                <p>4. The British Government are in communication with the
                                    Netherlands Oversea Trust with regard to the cessation of the
                                    “free imports” of coffee, tobacco and quinine from the Dutch
                                    colonies. They are also informed by the Dutch Government that
                                    the latter intend to transit 370,000 tons of gravel from Germany
                                    to Belgium before November 15th, as this is the quantity needed
                                    by the Germans up to next spring. The British Government attach
                                    importance to an understanding with the United States Government
                                    as to the latter’s negotiations with the Dutch Government.</p>

                                <p>5. If, after fixing rations for neutral European countries, those
                                    countries are to be directed to fetch their supplies from
                                    Australia, the voyage will take four months, and unless neutrals
                                    are warned to this effect in advance, there may be a period
                                    during which the Wheat Commission may have to cede American
                                    supplies to the neutrals. As, however, any intimation to the
                                    neutrals that they would have to fetch their supplies from
                                    Australia rather than from the United States would drive them
                                    immediately to purchase large quantities of supplies in the
                                    Argentine, an early settlement of the Argentine question seems
                                    to be imperative.</p>

                                    <item>The British Government understands that the United States
                                        Government are refusing licenses for the export of coal to
                                        Spain. They cordially agree with this policy especially as
                                        they hope soon to arrive at an arrangement with the Spanish
                                        Government by which Spain will definitely agree in future to
                                        economize tonnage by obtaining her supplies of coal from the
                                        United Kingdom. Eventually, however, they hope to arrive at
                                        an agreement with the Altos Hornos Co. in Spain to undertake
                                        a long-term contract to carry Spanish iron ore to the United
                                        Kingdom. This company is understood to have sent certain
                                        Spanish steamers to the United States to load coal but to
                                        have been refused export licenses. In the eventuality of
                                        this contract being concluded, the British Government would
                                        be glad to know whether the United States Government could
                                        license shipments of coal to the company by the steamers now
                                        in the United States ports if that course became desirable

                                <p>Some time ago the board were informed that the British Government
                                    had offered to buy the Danish cargoes of oil cake now in United
                                    States ports subject to the consent of the United States
                                    Government. It has now been found impossible to carry this oil
                                    cake to the United Kingdom except in Danish vessels and the
                                    Danes refuse to carry it. The Danish Chargé d’Affaires in London
                                    has therefore been told that a market may be found for the oil
                                    cake in the United States. The British Government would be glad
                                    to know in due course what happens in regard to these
                                    cargoes.</p>

                                <p>Denmark: Offers which the British Government had made to Denmark
                                    before the entry of the United States into the war for rations
                                    of certain articles have recently matured, and the British
                                    Government have been obliged to agree, so far as they are
                                    concerned, to these rations. The following is a list of rations
                                    thus recently fixed: <list>
                                        <item>Spiegeleisen, 250 tons a quarter.</item>

                                    <hi rend="italic">(8)</hi> In dealing with Scandinavian
                                    countries, the British Government have found great difficulty in
                                    regard to exports from those countries to Holland not consigned
                                    to the Netherlands Oversea Trust. These shipments are frequently
                                    declared in transit through Holland. A demand is now being made
                                    on the Norwegian Government that all exports from Norway to
                                    Holland shall be consigned to the Netherlands Oversea Trust.
                                    Swedish exports are, of course, still going free of all control.
                                    The British Government hope that the United States Government
                                    will bear this point in mind.</p>

                                memorandum of certain new developments in our Danish shipping
                                    agreement,<note n="1" xml:id="d88fn1">Not printed.</note> and

                                    >Not printed.</note> May I take this opportunity of emphasizing
                                the fact that we have suspended the issue of export licenses on all
                                commodities to Scandinavia and Holland from the British Empire,
                                except the half dozen specified, such as coal and salt to Norway,
                                vegetable oils to Holland, and munitions raw materials, of which you
                                already know. We are thus proceeding on the assumption that a
                                complete embargo is in operation against all these countries.</p>
                            <p>We have not had to wait for the denunciation of our agreements to do
                                this, as those agreements recognize the plea of shortage at home as
                                a ground for the refusal of export licenses. In pursuance of this
                                policy, we have just refused to facilitate the export from Australia
                                to Norway of nine thousand tons of wheat, asked for by the Norwegian
                                Food Commission.</p>

                                <p>At the conference held in London on September 17, 1917, the
                                    British and French Governments, adhering to the principles
                                    formulated by the Government of the United States have
                                    decided:</p>
                                <p>1. To give their full support to the policy of embargo on
                                    shipments to neutral countries bordering on the Central Empires
                                    as practiced by the United States until the three Governments
                                    shall have in <pb n="953" xml:id="pg_953" facs="0199"/>common
                                    accord determined the amount of imports strictly needed by those
                                    countries after they have entirely exhausted their natural
                                    resources. Although agreements previously entered into by the
                                    British and French Governments do not permit of a general
                                    embargo being applied in every case, the general principle which
                                    shall hereafter guide their action is that exceptions to the
                                    embargo shall not be granted except by way of barter, in
                                    exchange for products imperatively needed either for national
                                    defence or the revictualing of the Allies or of the territories
                                    invaded by the enemy.</p>
                                <p>Exceptions to the embargo without some return would only be
                                    admitted when involving a vital interest recognized by the
                                    Allies.</p>
                                <p>2. To proceed, in accordance with the principles adopted by the
                                    American Government, with the immediate determination of the
                                    quotas of imports which may be allowed to the countries
                                    adjoining Germany in return for the guarantees that they shall
                                    furnish to the Allies. Such a determination of restricted quotas
                                    is indeed indispensable in order that neutrals may not, for the
                                    purpose of securing the benefit of purchases made in other than
                                    the Allied countries, claim previous quotas that might not have
                                    been denounced.</p>
                                <p>To that end, the British and French Governments propose to the
                                    Government of the United States the immediate institution at
                                    London of an Inter-Allied Blockade Committee, composed of
                                    representatives of the United States and Allied Governments,
                                    working in conjunction with the Inter-Allied Commission of
                                    Supplies, and authorized to discuss all the general questions
                                    arising from the tightening of the blockade, as well as all the
                                    specific applications henceforth devised in common accord.</p>
                                <p>With a view to pooling the information at the command of the
                                    Allied Governments and ensuring its prompt utilization, it would
                                    be desirable to provide for the exchange of such information in
                                    each one of the three capitals through an Inter-Allied Bureau of
                                    Documentation instituted in conjunction with the organization in
                                    charge of the blockade.</p>

                                    <p>In regard to economic relations Switzerland and Allies,
                                        latter seem to be dominated more and more by pressure United
                                        States bringing to bear. American Confederation starts on
                                        principle of universal lack of foodstuffs and from fact that
                                        Allies as belligerents ought to share in foodstuffs before
                                        neutrals, who would thus be obliged to limit consumption.
                                        One sees even idea gaining ground in United States that
                                        issue food supplies to neutrals is favor which only ought to
                                        be accorded against compensation. People in United States
                                        have very simple ideas concerning this problem, even a bit
                                        elementary, and whose strict application would carry long
                                        way. Neutral states of north are in danger of feeling
                                        consequences. As far as concerns Switzerland more than once
                                        she found advocates in Governments of London and Paris who
                                        have intervened with American diplomacy to obtain certain
                                        moderation in restrictive measures against neutrals. The
                                        difficulties which we have with the Quadruple Alliance seem
                                        to be second rate after those provoked by rigid ideas
                                        proclaimed by American Confederation.</p>

                            <p>It would be well to bear in mind the danger of allowing the United
                                States to assume the full onus for restrictions on neutrals
                                especially when the impression is created that this is done against
                                the wishes of other belligerents.</p>

                                will in general be allowed to proceed without license when covered

                                course, be some special instances where for certain reasons the
                                embargo will have to be effective immediately, regardless of when
                                the goods were shipped, but these cases will be rare, and special
                                attention will be called to them at the time publicity is given to
                                the fact that they have been classified as requiring a license. All
                                future classification lists will give the date of classification and
                                will be given publicity, so as to minimize any question in the minds

                                to the border neutrals because the board has not yet been able to
                                elicit the information which will enable it to determine whether
                                such commodities will so benefit the enemy; and in accordance with
                                this policy the board feels that consistency demands that it should
                                not grant bunker licenses for a vessel which is bound for a border
                                neutral and carries a cargo which may benefit the enemy,
                                notwithstanding such cargo has originated in another country.</p>
                            <p>In other words, although the board has no means and does not purpose
                                to prevent trade between other neutrals and the border neutrals, it
                                is, nevertheless, in a position to state that if vessels wish to use
                                the coal of the United States they should not be permitted to apply
                                our coal to the prosecution of a voyage which will result in
                                supplying or assisting to supply the enemy with foodstuffs or
                                feed-stuffs or any other commodities.</p>
                            <p>Numerous cases have been presented to the board where vessels have
                                touched at a United States port <hi rend="italic">en route</hi> to a
                                border neutral and carrying cargo which did not originate in the
                                United States, but which is destined for a border neutral and will
                                undoubtedly accrue to the benefit of the enemy. This causes a
                                serious embarrassment, and to avoid such embarrassment the board has
                                adopted a policy calculated to prevent such cases arising in the
                                future. This policy consists in stipulating that a vessel <hi
                                    rend="italic">en route</hi> to non-European neutrals which
                                touches at a United States port for bunker coal shall not be
                                permitted to have bunker coal for the voyage unless she will agree
                                to return to the United States with a cargo which would be approved
                                by the board or which is destined for a country other than a border
                                neutral.</p>
                            <p>The board is anxious to assist neutral vessels in continuing their
                                service to South American and other non-European ports; but pending
                                the receipt of the complete information which has been solicited
                                from the border neutrals with respect to their resources and
                                requirements the board feels that it can properly pursue no other
                                policy than the one outlined above.</p>

                            <p>For your information, I may say, that an identical proposal was
                                simultaneously submitted to the French, Italian and Russian
                                Governments and that up to the present time it has been accepted in
                                its entirety by the Russian Government and that the French
                                Government has accepted it except Nos. 1 and 2. No reply has yet
                                been received from the Italian Government.</p>
                            <p>His Majesty’s Government has information which makes them confident
                                that the application of the proposed restrictions would be both
                                practicable and of the highest value; they believe that these
                                restrictions on financial transactions will re-inforce the blockade
                                by their effect in making it difficult for the enemy to obtain new
                                credits or utilise existing resources in neutral countries and will
                                have the immediate result of a further serious depreciation of the
                                exchange value of the mark.</p>
                            <p>Any further depreciation of the mark (which already stands at a
                                discount of approximately 50 per cent in each of the neutral
                                countries) could not fail to have pronounced effect upon mercantile
                                opinion in Germany where it is recognised how serious is the present
                                exchange position, and how disastrous any further depreciation must
                                be and how long and difficult the recovery after the war.</p>
                            <p>May I suggest that the adoption of the present proposal by the
                                Government of the United States will be directly useful to the
                                United States as tending to simplify the administration of the
                                Trading with the Enemy Act, inasmuch as it will inhibit at their
                                source, financial transactions of neutrals with the United States on
                                behalf of the enemy.</p>
                            <p>His Majesty’s Government therefore regard the present proposal as of
                                the greatest importance and urgency, both as a preventive of enemy
                                financial transactions and as strongly tending towards the financial

                                and they earnestly hope that the Government of the United States
                                will express their adherence to the proposal at the earliest
                                possible moment in order that the announcement in the neutral
                                European press may be made without delay.</p>

                            <p>The attention of the Department has been called to a statement
                                appearing in the press in regard to the intentions of this
                                Government in connection with the so-called world-wide embargo
                                against neutrals. There is no basis whatever for any statement which
                                implies that any final decision has been reached by the Exports
                                Administrative Board. The matter is still under discussion with the
                                neutrals and with the foreign governments associated with us in the
                                war.</p>
                            <p>Press despatches further state that it is understood that the United
                                States has urged upon Great Britain, for some time, the necessity
                                for taking stringent measures controlling exports similar to those
                                adopted by this Government and that Great Britain has consented to
                                abrogate all of its trade agreements with the northern neutrals in
                                line with suggestions of this Government.</p>
                            <p>It must be understood that though the embargo question is being
                                considered jointly, any action taken by Great Britain or France will
                                be based entirely on their own judgment after consultation and not
                                at the dictation of this Government. Department does not wish the
                                peoples and the governments of neutral countries to gain the
                                impression that this Government is dictating to England and France
                                an embargo policy hostile to neutral countries. As a matter of fact,
                                England has been urging us to adopt even a stricter control than we
                                have been willing to sanction. This Government is quite prepared to
                                assume full responsibility for such restrictive measures as it may
                                be called upon to enforce. These will in every case be dictated by
                                necessity with all possible regard for justice and for the feelings
                                of neutrals.</p>
                            <p>The Department is informed that Great Britain has terminated certain
                                agreements with neutral countries covering exports from Great
                                Britain to those countries. It is stated that this action was taken
                                for the purpose of clearing the way for new arrangements made
                                necessary by changed conditions since the entry of the United States
                                into the war.</p>

                            <p>The Exports Board states that one reason why a final policy has not
                                as yet been decided upon by this Government is the failure of the
                                board to obtain information from the Governments of certain northern
                                neutrals repeatedly requested as to the resources and requirements
                                of the northern neutrals and other information necessary for
                                intelligent action.</p>
                            <p>The efforts of this Government are aimed (1) at preventing aid going
                                to the enemy as a result of the release of shipments by this
                                Government to neutrals, and (2) at securing the cooperation of such
                                neutrals in the furnishing of their products needed by this country
                                or those associated with us in the war. There is absolutely no
                                ground for conjecture to the effect that this Government is
                                influenced by a desire to hamper neutrals in their normal life or
                                inflict upon them any hardships not necessarily resulting from the
                                execution of the aims outlined above. On the contrary our ancient
                                bonds of friendship, our selfish interest and our inclinations
                                prompt us to render them as much aid as possible in the present
                                difficult conditions.</p>
                            <p>It should be borne in mind that an essential factor in determining
                                this country’s policy towards European neutrals is the satisfactory
                                settlement and utilization of neutral tonnage now situated in our
                                ports. The withdrawal from active service of these ships complicates
                                the entire question and imposes upon this Government the need of
                                stricter measures to meet the situation.</p>
                            <p>Your reports relating to the questions of embargo are very helpful
                                and should be continued and made as complete as possible.</p>
                            <p>The Department will keep you informed on questions connected with the
                                embargo policy. Negotiations are continuing daily and most of these
                                are oral and tentative and you will not be advised of them unless
                                the Department considers them definite enough to be of assistance to

                                our Government intends to formally request Scandinavian countries to

                            <p>After a discussion, the board authorized the director [of the Bureau
                                of Export Licenses] to instruct the collectors of customs that,
                                under the law, no vessel should be permitted to clear from a United
                                States port without a license for her cargo, bunker fuel, sea stores
                                and ship’s stores (but only to the extent that the same are subject
                                to license under the first division or second division, as the case
                                may be, of the proclamation of August 27, 1917), notwithstanding
                                that such cargo, bunker fuel, sea stores or ship’s stores were not
                                taken on board at a United States port—the fact that they have been
                                brought into a United States harbor being sufficient to subject them

                            <p>5575. The question of treatment of northern neutrals is still being
                                considered. No decision has been reached. The Russian Government
                                have intimated through their Ministers in Norway and Sweden that
                                they fear the effect of a strict embargo on Sweden as it might bring
                                about retaliatory measures against Russia. It is being urged here
                                that the fish export in Norway and iron-ore export from Sweden to
                                Germany be entirely cut off. Department feels careful consideration
                                should be given as to possible result of such drastic action.
                                British Government seems to desire complete embargo but hesitates to
                                definitely recommend such a course.</p>

                                to desire a complete embargo but hesitate “to definitely recommend”
                                such a course. On the contrary the prolongation of the present
                                British embargo is not in the least desired. It was adopted as a
                                temporary measure pending acceptance by the border neutrals of the
                                Allied demands and concessions. It has already cost Great Britain a
                                matter of £50,000,000 not to speak of the adverse effect on
                                exchange.</p>
                            <pb n="971" xml:id="pg_971" facs="0217"/>
                            <p>The British Government are confident that complete demands can now be
                                made without risk of driving any border neutral into the war on the
                                side of Germany. The British have examined into this supposed
                                danger, which did exist earlier in the war, by military, political
                                and economic experts, and they have satisfied themselves that the
                                danger now no longer exists. An Allied victory is now so certain
                                that none of these states if it wished would dare join the enemy.
                                Some of the reasons for this conclusion were set forth in <persName
                                    corresp="frus1917Supp02v01#p_CLR1">Cecil</persName>’s memorandum
                                transmitted with my despatch No. 6758 of August 13 last.<note n="1"
                                    xml:id="d102fn3">Not printed.</note>
                            </p>
                            <p>Some of the Scandinavian states are intimating that they might be
                                driven into the enemy’s camp. But they have long used this threat
                                against the British and it is natural that they should still use it.
                                They have little else to use. Pending negotiations they continue
                                their profitable exports to Germany which are of great use to the
                                Germans and individual go-betweens take energetic advantage of the
                                interval of indecision.</p>
                            <p>On the other hand these neutrals are becoming weary of our detention
                                of their ships and there are indications that they would really
                                welcome definite demands by us and that they expect them to be
                                severe. The British believe that the neutral representatives will
                                continue to bluff as long as they think they can thereby gain their
                                ends but that when a clear policy is put into effect they will
                                become tractable.</p>
                            <p>The Russian objection is not regarded here as of the greatest
                                importance. Doubtless it could be met through diplomatic agreement.
                                It is believed that too much deference can easily be shown to Russia
                                in such case to the jeopardy of the general cause. Even if
                                retaliatory measures are adopted by Sweden, which is believed
                                unlikely, the disadvantage would be of short duration if we act
                                promptly.</p>
                            <p>In the matter of Swedish transit the Swedes have played both fast and
                                loose. <persName corresp="frus1917Supp02v01#p_SSCA1">Spring

                            <p>It will be your duty to make a careful study of the needs of the
                                Netherlands in respect to imports, the purpose for which those
                                imports are utilized, to what extent if at all those imports are
                                exported to Germany and in what manner; the extent to which in your
                                opinion, based upon such data as you may be able to gather, the
                                imports of various products might safely be reduced; and any other
                                information bearing upon these points which in your judgment might
                                be useful to the War Trade Board or this Department in dealing with
                                the subject of exports to or imports from the Netherlands.</p>
                            <p>In this work it will be the duty of the Minister and the consular
                                officers in the Netherlands to aid you in every feasible way by
                                supplying information which they may already have collected and by
                                making special investigations in their districts of subjects which
                                you may have been instructed to investigate. You will in turn
                                cooperate with them, keeping them informed of the work upon which
                                you are engaged and giving them copies of such data coming into your
                                possession as may prove useful to them in any studies or
                                investigations of political or commercial conditions which they may
                                be called upon to make. It is the Department’s desire that the
                                diplomatic and consular officers and the special assistants shall
                                work together in complete harmony, each assisting the other in his
                                special field to the extent of his capacity and receiving in turn
                                like assistance. It is also the Department’s desire that you should
                                bear in mind that, inasmuch as your services will probably terminate
                                at the end of the war, it should be your endeavor so to arrange your
                                work and archives as to enable you to leave behind in the Consulate
                                General as much of the experience and information acquired as may be
                                feasible, in view of the fact that the responsibility for
                                investigating commercial conditions <pb n="973" xml:id="pg_973"
                                    facs="0219"/>and dealing with commercial problems will in the
                                main fall upon the Consul General and other consular officers after
                                the war is over. While the Department does not undertake to indicate
                                the precise manner in which this shall be done, it is convinced that
                                a frank exchange of views between you and the Consul General and the
                                Minister will result in the formulation of a practicable plan.</p>
                            <p>You will consider such information as you may gather from all sources
                                in the light of such data as you may obtain, through the agency of
                                the Legation, from the missions of the Entente Allies at The Hague
                                and prepare from time to time concise but comprehensive reports upon
                                the general conditions of the country in so far as they relate to
                                the subjects with which the War Trade Board is called upon to deal,
                                your aim being to enable that board to gain in the easiest possible
                                way an intelligent and accurate understanding of the facts which
                                should form the basis of its action.</p>
                            <p>The original communications from consular officers and other data,
                                upon which your reports are based, should not be forwarded to the
                                Department but should be embodied in your reports, except where it
                                becomes necessary for you to quote or supplement your reports with
                                extracts from such communications of consular officers. It is
                                expected that consular officers will not send to the Department
                                direct copies of the communications which they send to you
                                containing information for your use but you will, on the other hand,
                                before forwarding your reports to the Department invariably submit
                                them to the Consul General at Rotterdam for examination and written
                                concurrence. If, for any reason, he should not concur in your
                                conclusions, he will attach his comments in a separate
                                memorandum.</p>

                                suppressed out of deference to the United States at the moment of
                                its entry into war but that this measure being purely one of
                                international courtesy could not be considered as rehabilitating
                                houses established in the United States which are either of the
                                enemy nationality or suspected of enemy association. French houses
                                or houses established in France which resume their relations with
                                the establishments in question fall under the law of April 4, 1915,
                                for trafficking with the enemy. For this reason the French
                                Government found it necessary to warn a French house against the
                                firm of Carl Grubnau which is a German.</p>
                            <p>The French Government has learned with satisfaction that American
                                Congress has recently voted a law relating to enemy commerce but is
                                ignorant of the (tenor?). If, as it does not doubt, the measures
                                taken in regard to any houses established in the United States are
                                of a nature to furnish all guarantees to French houses, as far as
                                the application of the law of April 4, 1915, is concerned, it will
                                not fail to raise the restrictions hitherto applied to the normal
                                resumption of commercial relations with certain American
                                companies.</p>

                                despatches from neutral countries, it seems desirable that publicity
                                be given to policy of this Government in regard to embargo in trade
                                to neutral nations.</p>
                            <p>On July 24 the Exports Council handed an identical note to the
                                representatives here of the Scandinavian countries and Holland
                                outlining the policy which the United States had decided to pursue
                                in regard to the assistance it was prepared to lend these northern
                                neutral countries in supplying them with the commodities which they
                                needed <pb n="975" xml:id="pg_975" facs="0221"/>for the continuance

                                    908</ref>.</note> This note requested information from these
                                countries as to their production, consumption and requirements of
                                all commodities and particularly of foodstuffs set out in the form
                                of protein, fats and carbohydrates. The note expressed the vital
                                interest of the United States in the aid which these countries would
                                furnish to Germany and her allies. The United States gave warning
                                that, pending a mutual arrangement as to furnishing supplies to any
                                of these countries or lending assistance in helping them to obtain
                                supplies for themselves, the United States would consider that any
                                exports which any of these countries might make to the Central
                                Empires would be considered as in reduction of the amount of
                                foodstuffs or other commodities which would be supplied to the
                                country in question for its own sustenance and industry.</p>
                            <p>If these countries continue to send aid to Germany and her allies it
                                would hardly be possible to expect the United States to help them in
                                securing supplies.</p>
                            <p>Notwithstanding the above warning some of these countries have
                                continued to send large quantities of vital supplies to the Central
                                Empires and despite repeated requests little information has been
                                forthcoming as to what these countries need for the sustenance of
                                their own people.</p>
                            <p>The War Trade Board just established by Executive order proposes to
                                continue the embargo policy which has been instituted and to deny
                                export licenses to any of these neutral countries so long as denied
                                the information which has been requested and so long as these
                                countries continue to give aid to Germany and her allies not only
                                directly but also indirectly, such as converting fodder into dairy
                                products, the use of oil for the operation of fishing craft, using
                                lubricating oil in the manufacturing establishments working for
                                German interests, in fact, for all the indirect assistance, which is
                                even more effective against the Allies than if these commodities had
                                been sent directly to Germany since the finished products are
                                delivered to the Germans instead of the raw materials which they are
                                to be manufactured or converted into. It is unreasonable to expect
                                that our farmers shall raise foodstuffs and our people deny
                                themselves the quantities they desire to consume in order that a
                                surplus may be sent to the northern neutrals to render easier for
                                them the help which they are extending to our enemies.</p>
                            <p>The policy of this Government is in no way inspired by a desire to
                                hamper or interfere with the normal fife of neutrals. On the
                                contrary we are willing to help these neutrals even at a sacrifice
                                to ourselves in allowing export to them of commodities we can ill
                                afford to spare, but <pb n="976" xml:id="pg_976" facs="0222"/>in
                                return for this friendly service we must demand some guarantee that
                                these supplies will not be turned against us to kill our sons and
                                prolong the war.</p>
                            <p>The welfare of the northern neutrals is in their own hands.</p>

                            <p>1141. Great Britain has requested Italy to cooperate with the Allies
                                and us and prohibit all shipments to Scandinavian countries and
                                Holland. I understand that Italian Government’s view is that
                                shipments should be minimized but not absolutely forbidden, which
                                they consider would throw those countries in arms of Germany.
                                Attention was called to fact that Sweden has a new Government
                                liberal and friendly to Allies. At present all exportation is
                                forbidden unless specifically authorized by commission having charge
                                of exportation, which they say permits no exportation of material
                                useful to Central Empires.</p>

                                    statement that the British representatives in Denmark have
                                    stated to them that the non-shipment of petroleum is not the
                                    fault of the British. They are approaching a crisis in their
                                    scarcity <pb n="977" xml:id="pg_977" facs="0223"/>in petroleum,
                                    and on the basis of the alleged statement of the British
                                    representatives, the Danish Government is throwing the entire
                                    responsibility upon the United States.</p>
                                <p>We have advices that indicate that Germany is taking advantage of
                                    the present situation and that all limitations on the
                                    exportation of cattle, for example, have been removed. An export
                                    tax is being collected only on the first seven thousand per
                                    week.</p>
                                <p>Yours faithfully,</p>

                                    opportunely, because we have just received a telegram from our
                                    Minister at Copenhagen through the Foreign Office, of which I
                                    give you a paraphrase below.</p>

                                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="frus1917Supp02v01#p_AFE1"
                                            >Anderson</persName> says that telegrams received by the
                                        Danish Government from the Danish mission in connection with
                                        negotiations at Washington had created an unfortunate
                                        impression, as they indicated that the United States were
                                        throwing blame on Great Britain for the tightening of the
                                        blockade.</p>
                                    <p>On the other hand, all the blame for this was thrown on the
                                        United States in a speech made by Mr.
                                            <persName>Foss</persName> at a recent public
                                        meeting.</p>
                                    <p>I received a remonstrance from the First Secretary of the
                                        American Legation here recently. He was under the impression
                                        that we were throwing the responsibility on the United
                                        States. Of course, I told him that he was mistaken, and that
                                        the line I had taken in speaking to the Minister for Foreign
                                        Affairs and others was that these questions were being now
                                        discussed between the Allies, who would formulate their
                                        policy together.</p>
                                    <p>It seems to me that the Danes are endeavouring to sow
                                        dissension between our two Governments.</p>
                                </quote>
                                <p>The same kind of thing is happening elsewhere. For instance, Mr.
                                        <persName corresp="frus1917Supp02v01#p_MVC1"
                                        >McCormick</persName> spoke to me the other day about
                                    reports he had received from Holland, that we were throwing the
                                    blame on the United States. Almost simultaneously we had a
                                    telegram from The Hague saying that the impression was being
                                    disseminated in Holland that the United States had taken their
                                    measures at our instigation.</p>
                                <p>I have not thought it worth while to trouble you with these
                                    reports, but it is perfectly evident that all these neutrals are
                                    trying to play us off against each other, and I do hope that we
                                    shall not be misled by their efforts.</p>
                                <pb n="978" xml:id="pg_978" facs="0224"/>
                                <p>There is, of course, no smoke without some fire, and when these
                                    neutrals come to us, as they sometimes do, asking us to
                                    represent to you that your action is resulting in the tearing up
                                    of compromise agreements made between us and the neutrals in the
                                    past, our representatives are in rather a dilemma what to say.
                                    They must avoid giving the impression that your policy is not a
                                    completely independent one, taken on the basis of your own
                                    sovereignty over your own exports, and they must equally avoid
                                    appearing to dissociate themselves from what you are doing. The
                                    difficulty is considerably increased by the frequent warnings
                                    given to me that opinions expressed in our discussions at the
                                    board are not to be taken as anything but informal and
                                    unofficial, so that we really have no statement from you with
                                    which we can express our agreement when we talk to neutrals.</p>
                                <p>We shall be glad of any line you can give us as to the exact
                                    reply which you would like given in such cases. I am not even
                                    sure that the statement which our Minister at Copenhagen says he
                                    has made to the Danish Minister for Foreign Affairs does not go
                                    further in the direction of associating ourselves with you than
                                    is agreeable to the Government of the United States.</p>
                                <p>Yours very truly,</p>

                                Affairs of the State Department has requested the War Trade Board in
                                the future to apply to the consideration of applications for
                                licenses for the export of arms and ammunition to Central and South
                                America the principles heretofore applied by the Division of Latin
                                American Affairs to such applications. The wishes of the division
                                have been made known to the board and in the future, in accordance
                                with this request, such applications will not be referred to the

                            <p>Among other details the Division of Latin American Affairs has
                                recommended that no applications for arms and ammunitions be
                                approved unless the application for license is accompanied by the
                                approval of the embassy or legation in Washington of the country of
                                destination. The Bureau of Exports of the War Trade Board would
                                prefer to establish one rule for all proposed exports of arms <pb
                                    n="979" xml:id="pg_979" facs="0225"/>and ammunitions and require
                                a similar approval from the embassy or legation in every country
                                including European countries.</p>
                            <p>We therefore ask advice from the Department of State whether the
                                promulgation of such a rule meets with its approval.<note n="1"

                                <p>The English Government, with a view to doing away with indirect
                                    revictualing of the enemy, has suspended licenses for exports to
                                    the northern countries and has given notice that articles which
                                    could heretofore be freely exported could no longer be so
                                    exported without derogation. This is commonly called embargo for
                                    short, though it is merely a decision of principle and in some
                                    cases a mere warning. The Undersecretary of Blockade has taken,
                                    in concert with our Allies, every measure intended to forewarn
                                    the French authorities concerned and likewise the export trade.
                                    Licenses are accordingly suspended in every case where transit
                                    is actually stopped by the English decision.</p>
                                <p>This is the cooperation which has just received the French
                                    Government’s approval.</p>

                                <p>The British Embassy has purposely refrained from confusing the
                                    discussion of policy by raising questions of apportionment of
                                    rations between the various exporting countries.</p>
                                <p>The principle which the British Government always sought to adopt
                                    before the entry of the United States into the war, has been
                                    that in any ration allotted to one of the border neutrals, the
                                    United States and the Allies in Europe (and the overseas
                                    neutrals—in so far as their export trade is concerned) should
                                    share in proportion generally to their pre-war trade and their
                                    present facilities for exporting. The British licensing
                                    authorities and the Contraband Committee in London, therefore,
                                    endeavoured at that time so far as possible to “split” the
                                    various rations between United States exporters, British
                                    exporters and other Allied exporters, with reasonable allowances
                                    in the case of such overseas neutrals as the Argentine.</p>
                                <p>This problem was discussed in general terms during Mr. <persName

                                    arrangement of this kind could be arrived at in regard to
                                    rations allotted to neutral countries by the United States, that
                                    it has not seemed worth while to raise the question at an
                                    earlier stage in pending discussions.</p>
                                <p>The rationing of neutrals by the United States appears to be
                                    proceeding on the general line that the neutrals state what
                                    quantities they require of commodities—which the United States
                                    may <hi rend="italic">prima facie</hi> be supposed to be able to
                                    export. The United States authorities then agree to grant
                                    licenses for stated quantities of these articles, provided that
                                    the conservation programme of the United States allows it, and
                                    that the commodities in question are not obtained from other
                                    sources, in which case the amounts licensed by the United States
                                    will be reduced in proportion. It is understood that the United
                                    States reserve to themselves the right of directing neutrals
                                    where to obtain these commodities, but it is not clear whether
                                    this right applies in cases where a shortage in United States
                                    supplies cannot fairly be advanced as a reason for refusing
                                    export licenses from the United States.</p>
                                <p>The negotiations between the United States authorities and the
                                    neutral representatives have proceeded generally on the
                                    assumption that the commodities in question are not obtainable
                                    from sources other than the United States. Taking the draft
                                    agreement with the Danish representatives as an instance, this
                                    assumption is not wholly <pb n="982" xml:id="pg_982" facs="0228"
                                    />correct. Practically all the commodities mentioned in the
                                    draft Danish agreement are ones of which the United Kingdom or
                                    other British dominions or possessions have been accustomed, up
                                    to the present moment, to export certain quantities to Denmark,
                                    As a matter of machinery, as the question stands at present, the
                                    British licensing authorities might appear in a sense to be
                                    bound to issue no export licenses for such commodities until
                                    satisfied that they could not be exported from the United
                                    States, and even if this were not so, Danish importers or the
                                    Danish importing associations might be held to be bound under
                                    the agreement to purchase these commodities only in the United
                                    States. It is, of course, understood that this is in no way the
                                    intention of the agreement, but in order that no friction may
                                    arise between British and American exporters, it seems desirable
                                    that a definite arrangement should be arrived at between the
                                    licensing authorities of the two countries on the whole
                                    subject.</p>

                            <p>I have previously invited your attention to this matter in connection
                                with certain commodities, see my telegrams Nos. 7477, 7260, 7249,
                                7216, 7062 and 7031,<note n="1" xml:id="d113fn3">Telegrams referred

                                formed, which controls all imports into the United States, I venture
                                to suggest as an improvement on the present procedure that all such
                                applications should first be sifted by the War Trade Board in order
                                that this board may group such appeals, with the result that we
                                should be pressing only for licenses covering commodities essential
                                to war purposes in the total amount required by the United States
                                over a period of months. The present practice makes the British War
                                Trade Department invidiously choose between firms in America without
                                knowing their respective qualifications for preference and I fear
                                this cannot but result in the United States not obtaining its proper
                                share of the exportable surplus of such essential commodities.
                                Furthermore, an equitable distribution of these commodities in the
                                United States cannot be effected under the present system. Another
                                reason for suggesting that recommendations for support of
                                applications should come through the War Trade Board is to insure
                                that a situation should not arise in which we might be pressing for
                                the export of articles of which the War Trade Board in the exercise
                                of its authority might prohibit the import.<note n="2"

                                point of view of the law which has just gone into effect in the
                                United States on this subject.</p>
                            <p>The British officials understand that the President has power under
                                existing legislation to proclaim individuals and firms to be enemy
                                firms wherever they may be, and they are hopeful that such lists
                                will be announced very shortly, or, alternatively, that “white
                                lists” may be announced composed of firms with whom trading is
                                permissible.</p>
                            <p>The Department will recall that in the case of China and Siam, the
                                British Government adopted the course of indicating in a “white
                                list” the individuals and firms with whom trading was entirely
                                permissible, and this system appears to work very well. It has the
                                great advantage that it stimulates reliable concerns to put
                                themselves unreservedly in the hands of the authorities as a means
                                of getting on to the list.</p>
                            <p>The British officials who discussed the matter with me some days ago,
                                are especially anxious that South America may be dealt with on
                                identical lines in Great Britain and the United States. Naturally I
                                could only state that I would draw the Department’s attention to the
                                whole question, which I accordingly do.</p>

                            <p>I would like to propose for your consideration the following plan to
                                be suggested to the British Blockade Ministry for discontinuance

                                licenses. I feel certain British authorities will accept this
                                plan.</p>
                            <p>Please cable progress made with enemy trade list and cable

                            <p>War Trade Board to retain London representative to whom Bureau
                                Exports would cable particulars daily of license application for the
                                shipments to border neutral destinations; this representative to
                                confer with War Trade Intelligence here to secure evidence available
                                on consignees. Our London representative can then sit as [<hi

                            <p>On strength of these reports War Trade Board to render its own
                                decisions on applications and in turn to advise London
                                representative by cable of applications granted, for information of
                                Blockade Ministry, enabling them to make necessary entries in their
                                statistical records of shipments to border neutrals from their own
                                and all other sources. This proposal makes available to us all
                                British Intelligence services which I have investigated and find
                                most complete and which cannot be effectively duplicated in
                                Washington; eliminates the letter of assurance system and any
                                further intermediation of British Embassy, Washington; transfers to
                                War Trade Board undivided control of American exports to border
                                neutral destinations. We estimate this operation would not take more
                                than three or four days for details. See Frothingham’s two letters

                                in regard to the Schieffelin Co.’s application for gum arabic. The
                                ungranted applications referred to in your cable under reply are
                                being considered. The remaining items are largely hides and skins.
                                One of the difficulties in this regard is that they were in almost
                                every case shipped to Great Britain after the British embargo had
                                been published. The American importers were therefore knowingly
                                running the risk of having their merchandise stopped here. I am
                                however again making representations to the Foreign Office in the
                                hope that licenses will be granted for the movement of all these
                                consignments, but respectfully invite your attention to the fact
                                that the question of shipping is the governing factor in all these
                                cases, as well as for many other commodities originating in the East
                                and required by the United States for purposes of war or for
                                commerce; and with a view not only of saving Allied tonnage on
                                balance but also to avoid the double submarine risk of
                                trans-shipment via Great Britain, it is extremely desirable that
                                shipments of all necessary commodities originating in the East be
                                made via the Pacific direct to the United States, and it is in the
                                hope that such an arrangement may be consummated that I am
                                suggesting to the Foreign Office that the hide and skin shipments
                                being retained here shall be released as being the end of such
                                movements involving trans-shipments via Great Britain.<note n="2"

                                one way or another will reopen long-delayed commerce and navigation.
                                You will appreciate that another difficulty in the way of securing
                                the release of these hides and skins is the fact that they are
                                presumably luxuries and not needed for the prosecution of the war.
                                The use of tonnage is therefore reluctantly conceded.</p>

                            <p>Our 13. Submitted your cable November 19 respecting discontinuance
                                navicerts to the President and he approved of our having
                                representative on [<hi rend="italic">of</hi>] the board in London to
                                act in the manner and scope indicated in your cable provided it be
                                distinctly understood that the decision of the War Trade Board with
                                regard to licenses will be final and that licenses in all cases are
                                to be honored. This proviso appears to us to be clearly covered by
                                your cable and with that understanding the board has formally
                                authorized the plan suggested by you in its entirety. In connection
                                with Swiss agreement it will probably be necessary for this board to
                                have representatives on the Commission Permanente Internationale des
                                Contingents to supervise shipments to Switzerland. Board has
                                authorized such representative with approval of the President. Enemy
                                trade list has been approved by the President and will be published
                                shortly.</p>

                                Imports of the War Trade Board the requisite machinery has been
                                supplied for increasing the importation of certain indispensable
                                commodities produced abroad. The supply now coming forward to this
                                country is limited by reason of export <pb n="993" xml:id="pg_993"
                                    facs="0239"/>embargoes imposed by foreign powers controlling the
                                territory in which such materials originate. Such action was made
                                necessary because of interference with normal production, as well as
                                the extraordinary consumption occasioned by the war. Among notable
                                examples of such materials may be mentioned tin, wool, rubber,
                                ferromanganese, leather, flax, and jute.</p>
                            <p>Prior to the enactment of this statute there was no governmental
                                agency especially designated to deal with the proper officials of
                                other governments in order to procure the release of commodities
                                required by the United States and which had been embargoed by other
                                governments. The governmental supervision of imports makes possible
                                a more effective scheme of reciprocity, and brings about a closer
                                unity of the countries associated together in the war. Heretofore,
                                in the absence of a responsible agency with which to deal, the
                                Allied Governments were not in a position to know that all products
                                exported by them to the United States would be utilized in a manner
                                most conducive to the success of the great common enterprise. With
                                the extension of scope in the operations of the War Trade Board
                                there is at hand a dependable medium through which the Allies will
                                be enabled more effectively to express their willingness to
                                reciprocate, by making liberal shipments of commodities much needed
                                by this country in exchange for the vast quantities of vital
                                supplies which are going forward to them in an unending stream.</p>
                            <p>The various trades dealing in the embargoed commodities have been or
                                are being so organized that the total requirements of each industry
                                can be accurately surveyed, the nonessential uses of any material
                                eliminated, and a system of control provided which will insure the
                                equitable distribution of the imported commodity and its consumption
                                in the most essential products. At present all of these materials
                                are permitted by foreign governments to come into this country only
                                under guarantees that they will not be reexported except under
                                specified restrictions; that they will not be used in trading
                                directly or indirectly with the enemy; and that no purchase of any
                                such material has been made as a speculation. At present these
                                guarantees are given to the consul or other representative of the
                                Allied Governments in this country, but this method of handling
                                imports has resulted in some dissatisfaction on the part of American
                                business men affected thereby.</p>
                            <p>Under the authority conferred upon the President by the “Trading with
                                the Enemy Act” the issuance of a proclamation requiring a <pb
                                    n="994" xml:id="pg_994" facs="0240"/>license for the importation
                                of these various articles puts into effect a plan whereby the giving
                                of guarantees by individual parties to a foreign government is
                                obviated, and American individuals or firms will henceforth deal
                                directly with their own Government in connection with their
                                importations.</p>

                            <p>Mr. <persName corresp="frus1917Supp02v01#p_BAJ1">Balfour</persName>
                                has just reached here from the Foreign Office and submitted to us
                                the following: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>The increasing difficulties with neutral powers contiguous to
                                        the enemy are causing His Majesty’s Government gravest
                                        concern. Our information is that there is serious unrest
                                        even in Norway and the position in Denmark, Sweden and
                                        Holland is scarcely better than the Swiss situation with
                                        which you are familiar. We cannot, in view of the difficulty
                                        of coming to a definite arrangement with the authorities in
                                        Washington, even induce the Americans to put forward
                                        definite demands as regards these countries although all
                                        supplies to them have been cut off. In the cases of Sweden
                                        and Holland the danger is especially serious: that danger is
                                        that Sweden and Holland will practically pass into a state
                                        of complete economic subjection to Germany since they will
                                        be forced to make with her the best terms that they can
                                        while the very precursory [<hi rend="italic">with very

                                        of all exports except coal from the United Kingdom is a
                                        lesser evil though one by no means to be left out of
                                        account.</p>

                                recommend, approved by House, that, due to the Russian difficulties
                                and general situation here, it is most important to come to a speedy
                                settlement with all of the northern neutrals as soon as possible. We
                                understand Norway and Denmark about concluded. Please confirm. We
                                urge the making of definite proposal to Holland at the earliest
                                possible moment and also Sweden. In regard to latter, the Allies and
                                ourselves feel that we cannot bring about a complete cessation of
                                export of iron ore to Germany and that we should therefore negotiate
                                for the greatest possible reduction. Please advise the present
                                status Holland and Swedish negotiations for our information. After
                                frequent conferences with the British, the French, and the Italian
                                representatives, we have agreed upon the Swiss proposal and expect
                                to confer with the Swiss delegates to-day and will take some time to
                                come to a settlement.</p>

                                            adopted the following resolutions: The Allies declare
                                            that they will give priority to all supplies intended
                                            for the provisioning of the Belgians and the population
                                            of the French invaded territory on the basis of the
                                            program of the Committee for the Provisioning of Belgium
                                            as it was drawn up in the course of conference held at
                                            London between the Committee for the Provisioning of
                                            Belgium and the British Government. They guarantee the
                                            tonnage necessary for the execution of this program
                                            taking into consideration such snips as the Committee

                                            and those which it may procure in the future either

                                        <item>The section considers it proper to submit to the
                                            conference the following general declaration: The
                                            prolongation of the war having caused a consumption of
                                            products of all kinds out of proportion to the
                                            production, it is evident that the resources available
                                            either in the Allied countries or in the various neutral
                                            countries are inferior to the actual need for supplies.
                                            It is therefore necessary in a general way to extend the
                                            principles laid down by the American Government towards
                                            the end of July last. The Allies considering that the
                                            means of maritime transportation at their disposal as
                                            well as the available supplies should be utilized in
                                            common for the pursuit of the war have decided to create
                                            an inter-Allied organization for the purpose of
                                            coordinating their action to this effect in establishing
                                            a common program constantly kept up to date permitting
                                            the maximum utilization of their resources and the
                                            restrictions of their imports in order to release the
                                            greatest amount of tonnage possible for the transport of
                                            American troops.</item>

                                        interest to the Allies were successively discussed. At the
                                        end of its work the section unanimously adopted the
                                        following resolution: The financial delegates of the powers
                                        believe that for coordination of effort it is desirable to
                                        have regular meetings in order to decide questions relative
                                        to payments, credit and exchange and thus to ensure
                                        concerted action.</p>

                                        of the United States, and Monsieur <persName
                                            corresp="frus1917Supp02v01#p_KLL1">Klotz</persName>, in
                                        the name of France, informed the section that in their
                                        opinion these meetings should constitute a permanent
                                        organization. The resolutions adopted as well as the
                                        intentions expressed by all the delegates are proof of the
                                        financial solidarity of the Allies. This solidarity will in
                                        practice manifest itself by a methodical coordination of
                                        effort which will determine the judicious utilization of
                                        resources and the best distribution of their strength.</p>

                                classes of persons with whom it shall be unlawful to trade. In this
                                relation, it is necessary to emphasize the fact that it is not only
                                unlawful to trade with enemies or allies of enemies as defined by
                                section 2, but that it is also unlawful to trade with any person of

                                persons, there is printed on the overleaf an extract from the
                                general instructions of the War Trade Board to the Bureau of Export
                                Licenses. The application of these is intended to supplement the
                                Trading with the Enemy Act and to attain as one object the
                                prevention of trading directly or indirectly with, on behalf of, on

                                defined in the act.</p>
                            <p>Consular officers will obtain for the use of the War Trade Board,

                                ally of enemy character or association, and (2) persons, firms or
                                corporations not of enemy or ally of enemy character or association
                                who might be in position to take over the activities of such persons
                                or firms as representatives or agents of American concerns.</p>
                            <p>The information will be used, first, by the War Trade Board to
                                establish and correct the lists of those firms with which it is
                                unlawful for American firms to trade, under the provisions of the
                                Trading with the Enemy Act, and, second, by that board or by the
                                Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce to furnish to American firms
                                the names of persons or firms of non-enemy character who might
                                represent their interests.</p>
                            <p>This survey in each consular district is designed in the first place
                                to include only those individuals and firms which are now engaged
                                directly in business with American concerns or which are in a
                                position to establish such relations. It is essential that the
                                information be submitted promptly and it should be forwarded as
                                collected, without awaiting the completion of the entire work.</p>
                            <p>Each consular officer will be supplied with forms on which to submit
                                the desired data. It will not be possible in the first report to
                                submit all the data desired, but there should be presented a
                                sufficient number of the essential facts to determine whether the
                                firm is to be classed as an enemy firm or whether it can lawfully
                                establish or <pb n="999" xml:id="pg_999" facs="0245"/>continue trade

                                submitted further information with regard to the character or
                                activities of the firm become available, this should be submitted in
                                a supplementary report. This applies particularly to the data called
                                for under item 15.</p>
                            <p>A small supply of card forms upon which the reports are to be made is
                                transmitted under separate cover. Additional copies of the forms may
                                be obtained upon requisition. All reports should be made in

                                persons, firms and corporations of enemy or “ally of enemy”
                                character or association, and also those not of enemy or “ally of
                                enemy” character or association which are in a position to take over
                                the activities of enemy or “ally of enemy” firms as representatives

                                limited to the importation of goods from that country, would by

                                consigned to the Netherlands Oversea Trust (or possibly, in the case
                                of certain commodities, such as wheat, to the Dutch Government); and
                                that no goods should be licensed to Norway unless consigned to one
                                or other of the various trade associations. The machinery for
                                controlling imports into Sweden will have to be set up in the
                                pending negotiations in London, because hitherto the Swedish
                                Government has refused to allow any formation of such machinery as
                                exists in the other three northern neutral countries.</p>

                            <p>In the case of Denmark and Holland the only thing necessary, if the
                                United States Government agrees with this course, is to recognize
                                the Danish associations and the Netherlands Oversea Trust as they
                                stand at present. But in the case of Norway, where we have, in one
                                form or another, denounced our agreements with the various
                                associations, the final agreement between the War Trade Board and
                                the Norwegian Government must, in some form, provide for the
                                reconstruction of these associations and, possibly, the organization
                                of one or two new ones. This point has already been brought to the
                                attention of the War Trade Board and the suggestion has already been
                                made to them, under instructions from the Government in London, that
                                the provisions of the final agreement covering questions of
                                machinery and methods of control should be drafted, in the first
                                instance, by the United States and British Ministers at Christiania
                                for submission to the two Governments. It seems most important that
                                instructions in this sense should be sent to Christiania at the
                                earliest possible moment and I shall be glad to learn whether you
                                are prepared to send such instructions.</p>
                            <p>The above suggestions do not, of course, affect the necessity of
                                obtaining general guarantees in your agreements from the neutral
                                Governments themselves, as the War Trade Board are already doing. It
                                is, however, important, in the view of my Government, to recognize
                                that none of these neutral Governments can themselves exercise
                                sufficient control unless the trade interests in their countries are
                                themselves made responsible for the actual supervision of imported
                                goods and, possibly, also of some native goods, to which the
                                agreements may apply. To rely on the Governments alone would be to
                                substitute an endless three-cornered diplomatic correspondence, in
                                which the neutral Governments would be placed between
                                representations from the German Government and from the United
                                States and Allied Governments for the continual unofficial
                                supervision which can be exercised by American and Allied
                                representatives in the neutral countries in close consultation with
                                the friendly commercial interests in those countries.</p>

                            <p>There was vested in said War Trade Board authority, as in said
                                Executive order is more particularly set forth, to issue or refuse
                                to issue licenses for the importation or exportation of articles the
                                importation or exportation of which might be restricted by any
                                proclamation issued by you in accordance with law, and there was
                                further vested in said War Trade Board certain authority to issue or
                                refuse to enemies or allies of the enemy, other than enemy or ally
                                of enemy insurance or reinsurance companies, licenses to do business
                                in the United States, and certain authority to grant or refuse
                                licenses to trade with an enemy or ally of enemy. The War Trade
                                Board was, by said Executive order, authorized to and did take over
                                and exercise, without interruption, the powers theretofore exercised
                                by the above-mentioned Exports Administrative Board. The War Trade
                                Board has, since its creation, been exercising the powers thus
                                conferred upon it, and in addition, since November 23, 1917, it has
                                been acting as the agency of the Secretary of the Treasury in
                                administering the authority vested in him relative to transmitting
                                out of the United States communications intended to be delivered to
                                an enemy or ally of enemy.</p>

                            <p>The activities of the board are roughly divisible into three spheres,
                                viz., those relating to the control of exports, those relating to
                                control of imports, and those relating to enemy trade.</p>

                            </p>
                            <p>By means of its authority to grant or withhold licenses to export
                                commodities, the export of which was controlled by presidential
                                proclamation, the board has sought, first, to conserve for ourselves
                                and for those associated with us in the war such commodities as are
                                required to maintain adequately the economic life of the several
                                nations and to carry out their war programs. Other objects sought
                                have been to prevent our commodities reaching the enemy, directly or
                                indirectly, as by releasing like goods for the enemy, and to prevent
                                commercial transactions between persons within the United States and
                                an enemy or ally of enemy. In several cases, in seeming
                                contravention of the first principle above referred to, exports have
                                been offered to neutrals even where our own supplies and those of
                                our cobelligerents have been very limited. In such cases the board
                                has been actuated by a desire to prevent acute suffering in those
                                neutrals and to prevent them from falling under the economic power
                                of the enemy. It has been thought that even though such exports
                                would entail an additional sacrifice on the part of our own people
                                this burden should nevertheless be borne as a tangible evidence of
                                the friendship of our people to those foreign peoples whose
                                governments were endeavoring to maintain their neutrality on an
                                equitable basis.</p>
                            <p>The application of the foregoing principles has been particularly
                                important in the case of those European neutrals which are in trade
                                relations with the enemy, and it has been found necessary in the
                                case of such neutrals to enforce temporary embargoes pending the
                                securing of information indispensable to permit the board to issue
                                licenses in accordance with the principles above expressed.</p>
                            <p>On December 5, 1917, the board adopted a comprehensive measure
                                dealing with licenses to export goods to Switzerland. This assures
                                to Switzerland the periodic receipt of certain amounts of grain, of
                                which Switzerland will have urgent need, and it contemplates the
                                licensing for export to Switzerland of additional supplies of
                                foodstuffs and other commodities required by Switzerland to maintain
                                its economic existence. The Swiss Government, on the other hand,
                                gives satisfactory assurances against exportation to our enemies of
                                imported commodities and agrees to limit, in certain other respects,
                                her trading with the enemy. Negotiations with other European
                                neutrals have for some time been in progress and have advanced to a
                                point where it is hoped that definite and comprehensive
                                understandings can shortly be reached. In the case of certain of
                                those neutrals <pb n="1010" xml:id="pg_1010" facs="0256"/>there has
                                been a regrettable delay owing to failure to receive from them
                                information necessary to guide the board’s action, and owing to
                                pressure brought to bear on them by the enemy.</p>
                            <p>The supply of ships with bunker and ship’s stores, while controlled
                                by virtue of the board’s general authority over export licenses, has
                                necessarily been exercised in accordance with special
                                considerations, the most important of which has been to assure the
                                utilization of our own restricted supplies of coal, fuel oil, and
                                ship’s stores primarily by ships performing services useful to the
                                United States and her associates in the war. In exercising its
                                authority in this respect the board has sought to cooperate closely
                                with the United States Shipping Board.</p>

                                there was published on October 6, 1917, an enemy trading list

                            <p>In exercising its authority to grant or refuse licenses to import
                                commodities the importation of which is controlled by presidential
                                proclamation, the board has sought, first, to secure to this country
                                supplies adequate for the conduct of the war and the general welfare
                                of the country, and, secondly, to control when necessary the
                                distribution of important materials, to the end that they might be
                                devoted to the needs of the country in the order of their urgency.
                                The exercise of control over imports has in many cases been
                                necessary to secure importation of adequate supplies, as many
                                commodities are controlled by cobelligerents who have such need
                                therefor themselves that they are not willing to permit exportation
                                to this country unless assured that the goods will be devoted to
                                uses which will assist in the successful prosecution of the war.
                                Opportunity has frequently arisen, and has been availed of, to
                                stimulate foreign production, and thus to insure increased imports
                                of desired commodities.</p>

                                license has been issued. As illustrating the class of cases where
                                licenses have been issued, there may be noted transactions entered
                                into and in part completed before the declaration of war which still
                                require some unimportant action on the part of an American firm in

                                Progress along these lines has been such that it is confidently
                                believed that calls at Halifax by vessels sailing from our ports
                                will be eliminated and export licenses issued by the War Trade Board
                                will be recognized by our cobelligerents without the aid of national
                                documents of their own.</p>
                            <p>The task of the War Trade Board, as the foregoing will have
                                indicated, has been not so much the creation of new forces as the
                                supervising and directing of an existing force, our foreign
                                commerce, to the end that it shall most effectively assist in the
                                prosecution of the war. Indications are not lacking that this is
                                being successfully accomplished. The agreement with Switzerland has
                                already been referred to. In the case of the northern European
                                neutrals, where temporary embargoes are in force pending the
                                conclusion of comprehensive agreements, their exports of foodstuffs
                                to the Central powers have declined from last year’s corresponding
                                exports in amounts estimated at from 65 to 85 per cent, depending on
                                the neutral, and there has been a decrease in the export of many
                                other important commodities. In November, 1917, we became a party to
                                Great Britain’s tentative agreement with Norway, as a result of
                                which action on our part 1,400,000 tons dead weight of Norwegian
                                shipping were chartered into the service of the United States and
                                Great Britain for the period of the war. Shortly following the date
                                as of which this report speaks (December 31, 1917) temporary
                                agreements were concluded with Holland and with Sweden. That with
                                Holland gives us the use for periods up to 90 days of 450,000 tons
                                dead weight <pb n="1012" xml:id="pg_1012" facs="0258"/>of her
                                shipping which had theretofore for a long period lain idle. The
                                agreement with Sweden gives us the use for three months of tonnage
                                estimated at 250,000 tons dead weight which had not theretofore been
                                employed in services useful to us.</p>
                            <p>Specific accomplishments of this character are, however, far from
                                constituting a full measure of the results achieved by the War Trade
                                Board during the period under review. The elimination of enemy
                                advantage from our trade and to a considerable extent from that of
                                the world, the securing and conserving of commodities essential to
                                ourselves and those associated with us in the war, the bringing of
                                shipping generally into the services most useful to us—these results
                                can not be accurately stated or appraised at the present time, nor
                                have they been accomplished by any single act or agreement. It is by
                                a daily routine, where thousands of commercial transactions are
                                scrutinized and acted upon, that there has been created a powerful
                                economic weapon which is being utilized, and it is believed
                                effectually utilized, to augment the power of the United States and
                                her cobelligerents, and scientifically to undermine the strength of
                                the enemy.</p>
                            <p>To permit of the efficient transaction of the business which has come
                                before it, the board has from time to time created various bureaus
                                charged with the duty of administering, under the direction of the
                                board, policies formulated by the board, and securing the
                                information necessary to guide the board’s actions. The following
                                are the bureaus so created, with a brief statement of their
                                respective duties: <list>

                            <p>The personnel of the War Trade Board as of the date of December 31,
                                1917, amounts to 1,526. The total amount of financial obligations
                                incurred up to December 31, 1917, is $541,498.80, whereof
                                $435,213.50 was incurred by the War Trade Board proper since its
                                creation on October 12, 1917, and whereof $106,276.65 was incurred
                                by the Exports Administrative Board, this including outstanding
                                liabilities of August 27, 1917, contracted by the Department of
                                Commerce and paid by the Exports Administrative Board. No salary
                                paid by the board exceeds $3,500.</p>
                            <p>The board maintains branch offices in the cities of Boston, Mass.;
                                Chicago, Ill.; New Orleans, La.; New York, N. Y.; San Francisco,

                                Philadelphia, Pa. In the city of Washington the board and its
                                several bureaus occupy all or parts of 12 different buildings. The
                                necessity for a physical separation of the different offices of the
                                board has militated against complete cooperation and economy of time
                                and labor. A contract has now been made for the construction of a
                                new two-story building with 204,552 feet of space, and it is hoped
                                that this building will be ready for occupancy by April.</p>

                                a problem of magnitude. Such measure of success as may have been
                                realized has been due very largely to the personal loyalty of those
                                comprising the organization. They have given their best endeavor
                                whole-heartedly, and in large part without adequate financial
                                remuneration. The cooperation of other governmental departments has
                                been of the greatest assistance to the board. Business and
                                commercial interests of the United States have, with hardly an
                                exception, accepted without complaint the measures adopted by the
                                War Trade Board, even though such measures may have been burdensome
                                and have involved them in financial losses. Their attitude in this
                                respect has been a striking testimonial of their loyal support of
                                the Government in the conflict in which it is engaged.</p>
                            <p>I have the honor to be,</p>
                            <p>Very respectfully yours,</p>

                            <p>586. The publication in Danish papers of the last few days that a
                                Senate resolution is about to be voted upon restricting or
                                prohibiting the exportation of wheat and other cereals to countries
                                contiguous to Germany has caused great alarm.</p>
                            <p>This resolution if passed will cause in Denmark, and I believe in the
                                other Scandinavian countries, a feeling against the United States
                                that will react unfavorably after the war.</p>
                            <p>The control of all foodstuffs by Great Britain is now most effective.
                                The British policy in regard to exports necessary for the farmers
                                has been alternately too drastic or not drastic enough. The old
                                quarrel between the British Foreign Office and the Admiralty led to
                                confusion and often to injury. Even now when the Danish committees
                                are acting in accordance with British control it looks as if Denmark
                                would be thrown commercially into the arms of Germany after the war.
                                It is important that the small neutrals should not be turned against
                                us commercially. This control by the British has engendered among
                                the merchants and others much bitter feeling in these northern
                                countries. The prohibition by us of wheat, etc., would put on us the
                                onus of explanation that is now borne by the British. Besides we are
                                holding a certain amount of money as against, I understand, the
                                purchase of agricultural necessities.</p>
                            <p>It is felt here that the trade of the United States should be kept
                                open with Denmark. It might be arranged that American bottoms should
                                not be used to carry foodstuffs and other supplies intended for
                                Denmark.</p>
                            <p>I respectfully urge that the most careful consideration be given to
                                this matter and that the question of embargo be settled without
                                delay.</p>

                                foodstuffs from the United States to some of the neutral countries
                                in Europe is among the matters to be considered during the
                                forthcoming conversations at Washington between the American
                                Government and representatives of Great Britain and France the
                                Norwegian Minister begs to communicate to the American Government
                                for their confidential use the following information received from
                                the Norwegian Government:</p>
                            <p>The entire importation of foodstuffs from America to Norway is
                                covered by prohibitions of exportation and by agreements between the
                                Norwegian importers in the branch of commerce concerned and the
                                British Government. The Norwegian Government has approved these
                                agreements whereby exportation of imported goods contrary to
                                declarations made at the time of the importation of such goods, is
                                rendered punishable. The Norwegian Government have pledged
                                themselves towards the British Government not to grant permit for
                                the exportation of goods contrary to the said agreements unless such
                                permit shall have been recommended by the Norwegian association
                                representing the branch of commerce concerned, the Norwegian
                                associations of the branches of commerce having in their turn bound
                                themselves towards the British Government to recommend that such
                                permit be granted only against the written consent thereto of the
                                British Legation at Christiania. This obligation on the part of the
                                said Norwegian associations does not only affect the goods imported
                                into Norway under the agreements in question between the Norwegian
                                branch of commerce concerned and the British Government, but it
                                embraces also products of Norway of a similar kind. For instance, by
                                the agreement between the Norwegian association concerned and the
                                British Government in regard to grain and flour the Norwegian
                                Government is bound not to grant dispensation for exportation to
                                Germany either of domestic Norwegian or of imported grain and flour
                                as well as of products thereof. In the same way the agreement in
                                regard to raw materials for margarine prevents the Norwegian
                                Government from granting dispensation for exportation to Germany
                                even of butter made in Norway. All the agreements concluded between
                                the Norwegian branch-associations concerned and the British
                                Government are based on the same principle which prevents from being
                                exported to Germany all similar articles of Norwegian
                                production.</p>
                            <p>The Norwegian Minister of Foreign Affairs has finally directed the
                                Minister at Washington to represent to the American Government <pb
                                    n="1017" xml:id="pg_1017" facs="0263"/>that owing to Norway’s
                                own insufficient production of foodstuffs famine would result in
                                Norway unless the country’s supply of foodstuffs from the United
                                States be maintained as up to the present time.</p>
                            <p>The Norwegian Minister ventures to hope that the above information
                                may be found satisfactory.</p>

                            <p>340. I am requested by the Foreign Office to inform you that Envoy
                                    <persName>Lagercrantz</persName> is proceeding to America
                                accompanied by his assistant, Mr. <persName>Nordvall</persName>, on
                                the steamer <hi rend="italic">Oscar II</hi> sailing from Christiania
                                May 4 as a representative of the Royal Swedish Government to confer
                                with the American Government regarding importation from United
                                States to Sweden of foodstuffs and raw material. Mr.
                                    <persName>Lagercrantz</persName> was formerly Swedish Minister
                                at Washington. He is one of the influential business men of Sweden
                                and enjoys the confidence and intimacy of his Government.</p>
                            <p>In connection with the above the control of American supplies into
                                Sweden is important in consideration of Sweden’s relationship with
                                Germany. Also a matter of important consideration in connection with
                                any question of Swedish food supplies is the fact that Sweden does
                                not permit the entry of food or other articles with few exceptions
                                into Russia except under licenses granted by the Swedish Government
                                in return for permission from Great Britain to import supplies for
                                Swedish consumption. Naturally, Russia being largely cut off from
                                their supplies through this Swedish law, it has had a serious effect
                                upon Russia’s not receiving freely supplies through Sweden which at
                                times has been practically the only route of transportation and at
                                all times is an open, easy and important route.</p>
                            <p>Therefore, I am calling the Department’s attention to the importance
                                of these matters in connection with the subjects which
                                    <persName>Lagercrantz</persName>
                                <pb n="1018" xml:id="pg_1018" facs="0264"/>will bring up for
                                discussion. The matter of import of food to Sweden is at present a
                                most sensitive question with the Swedish Government. It has been the
                                subject of continuous negotiation between the British and Swedish
                                Governments and has caused great irritation. …</p>

                            <p>358. Referring our 346. Following has been given out officially to
                                which conference agreed:</p>
                            <p>To continue impartial neutrality policy heretofore followed. Consider
                                it out of question to take initiative either alone or in conjunction
                                with other neutral countries in mediation of peace or to take other
                                similar measures. To try to bring about cooperation with other
                                neutral states for mutual interests at time of or after ending of
                                war and also interest of neutrals to participate in general work to
                                be taken up concerning future international laws. Three governments
                                have attention called to fact that inter-parliamentary groups of
                                Scandinavian countries have taken up this latter question. Question
                                of present difficult situation of importation by sea was most
                                carefully discussed. Certain principal lines were established for
                                economic cooperation during and after war and desirability of
                                continuing economic cooperation and exchange of goods between
                                Scandinavian countries during war and of further development this
                                cooperation. That it would be advisable have renewed conferences
                                between technical representatives of three countries as to which
                                measures should be <pb n="1019" xml:id="pg_1019" facs="0265"/>taken
                                to prepare for overcoming of danger from mines even after war ended.
                                All parties expressed hope that present cooperation might be
                                continued.</p>

                                the Scandinavian Prime and Foreign Ministers held May 9 to 11 the
                                Minister for Foreign Affairs informed me that it was unanimously
                                agreed that the three countries would continue their policy of
                                impartial neutrality and that the question of mediation would not be
                                considered except at the explicit request of the belligerents. He
                                stated that it was agreed that the Scandinavian countries must
                                cooperate to the fullest extent possible with other neutral states
                                in order to protect their joint interests during and after the war.
                                It was also decided that the three countries must continue as before

                                that every effort should be made to exchange domestic products. His
                                Excellency added that particular emphasis was given to the fact that
                                no imported goods would be exchanged or sent out of the countries
                                and that in this connection the hope was expressed that the United
                                States would not impose too many restrictions. It was decided
                                further that a meeting of technical representatives would be
                                advisable to discuss measures to be taken for overcoming the danger
                                of mines both now and after the war. The question of submarine
                                warfare was discussed but no further action would be taken beyond
                                the joint protest which was made in February last.</p>

                                either of exports to the Allies or of transit facilities to Russia.
                                It was further suggested that it should be made clear that such
                                compensation should be in addition to the compensation already
                                provided for in the draft agreement between the British and Swedish
                                Governments, the ratification of which by the Swedish Government
                                should, it was proposed, form part of the demands to be put forward
                                by the Government of the United States.</p>
                            <p>In view of changed circumstances, the British Government now doubt
                                whether the final conclusion of this draft agreement would be
                                advantageous. While, therefore, the suggestions made in the
                                memorandum of May 7 still represent the wishes of the British
                                Government in all other particulars, that Government would now
                                prefer that the United States Government should not press for the
                                ratification of the draft agreement but should simply stipulate, in
                                negotiating for compensation with the Swedish Government, that such
                                compensation should be in addition to similar compensation granted
                                or to be granted in exchange for exports or services obtained from
                                Great Britain or her allies.</p>

                            </p>
                            <p>We have been placed in a position to give the following information
                                regarding Sweden’s requirements in tonnage:</p>
                            <p>During the year 1914 the tonnage used for Sweden’s import and export
                                consisted of 51 per cent Swedish and 49 per cent foreign tonnage;
                                during 1915 the corresponding figures were 48 per cent and 52 per
                                cent. It should, however, be taken into account that about 18 per
                                cent of the Swedish merchant marine then was occupied in foreign
                                trade (outside of Sweden). Even if these 18 per cent could be used
                                for Sweden’s account, it is evident from the figures above given
                                that the requirements of the country could not be filled even by
                                using the total Swedish tonnage.</p>
                            <p>Moreover, one has to take into consideration the fact that during the
                                war the Swedish merchant marine has been diminished by accidents
                                (through submarine warfare, etc.) as well as by sale of vessels to
                                foreign countries, and also that a great part of the Swedish tonnage
                                lies idle in foreign ports (mainly on account of lack of facilities
                                from the British side).</p>
                            <pb n="1021" xml:id="pg_1021" facs="0267"/>
                            <p>Considering these facts, it will be understood that Sweden’s import
                                and export can not be handled by Swedish tonnage alone under now
                                existing conditions, unless a considerable decrease in our foreign
                                trade should take place; but even if such decrease should occur it
                                would not be possible for the Swedish tonnage to satisfy Sweden’s
                                absolute needs unless the British Government will make such
                                facilities available so as to render it possible for the Swedish
                                vessels now tied up in foreign ports to resume regular trade for
                                Sweden’s account.</p>
                            <p>It is therefore of utmost importance to Sweden that the Swedish
                                tonnage now in American and English ports be released.</p>

                                many newspapers, that the neutral countries of Europe are draining
                                    <pb n="1023" xml:id="pg_1023" facs="0269"/>the supply of the
                                United States, and thus threatening a serious condition in this
                                country, we desire to make the following statement:</p>
                            <p>The Swedish Government took entire charge of the grain situation in
                                that country early in 1915, and since then the stocks of grain, as
                                well as the sale and distribution thereof, have been under the
                                control of the Swedish Government. All purchases of grain for human
                                consumption have been made by the Royal Swedish Victualling
                                Commission, and all purchases of this commodity have been made by
                                the authorized agent of that commission in New York. The last
                                contract for food cereals in the United States was placed by this
                                agent on the 27th of last January, and since that time no further
                                purchases have been contracted for in this country.</p>
                            <p>Because of shipping restrictions it has not been possible to export
                                these purchases, and the wheat has been and is now stored in
                                elevators here.</p>
                            <p>It is true that in some cases it has been necessary to exchange old
                                wheat for equal quantities of the new crop, and these are the only
                                transactions made for Swedish account since the 27th of January.</p>
                            <p>We have not been in the American market for any further quantities of
                                food cereals since the beginning of the year, and, although there is
                                great need in Sweden, we have felt that it was advisable to postpone
                                all further purchases until the attitude of the United States toward
                                exportation should be made clear. We have no desire whatever to
                                create difficulties for the United States Government, and have
                                scrupulously avoided any premature action that might so result.</p>
                            <p>We have now stored in elevators in this country, for Swedish account,
                                purchased before the 27th of January, 1917, less than a million and
                                a half bushels of wheat altogether.</p>
                            <p>An embargo has been laid upon all exports of cereals from Sweden, and
                                no licenses for such export are given to anyone.</p>

                                had the honor of addressing to you a note concerning the exports
                                from Denmark before and during the present war,<note n="1"
                                    xml:id="d152fn1">Not printed.</note> with a view especially to
                                correct any misconception of this matter which might possibly have
                                been <pb n="1024" xml:id="pg_1024" facs="0270"/>created by certain

                                Atlantic.</p>
                            <p>In my endeavour and anxiety to contribute everything in my power to
                                make the actual situation in Denmark and our point of view clear to
                                you, I cabled at the same time to the Danish Minister of Foreign
                                Affairs, suggesting to him to place at my disposal such full and
                                actual information regarding our position and situation that I could
                                lay it before you with some prospect of serving a useful purpose, as
                                owing to the irregularity of mail-communications during the war and
                                the distance from home, I did not feel that I was fully enlightened
                                myself on the said points or in possession of such complete
                                information that would allow me to set the matter forth to you with
                                the weight which the subject undoubtedly requires.</p>
                            <p>In reply the Minister has now cabled me what I have stated in the
                                memorandum enclosed herewith, and he has at the same time instructed
                                me to seek an interview with you and to say to you then what I have
                                stated in the memorandum.</p>
                            <p>I beg that when you have acquainted yourself with the contents of the
                                memorandum, you will be so good as to indicate a day and an hour
                                when it will be convenient for you to see me on this subject.</p>

                                    United States surprise has repeatedly been expressed when the
                                    fact was mentioned that during the present war Denmark has
                                    continued its commercial relations with Germany (and Austria),
                                    and the suggestion has been made that Denmark should voluntarily
                                    cease to trade with the Central powers or by measures taken by
                                    the Allies be placed in such a position that it could no longer
                                    trade with the Central powers.</p>
                                <p>The following remarks will to a certain degree make it clear why
                                    Denmark could not voluntarily stop the said trade and what the
                                    consequences would be if an attempt were made at compelling
                                    Denmark to cease all commercial relations with the Central

                                <p>When one remembers the geographical situation of Denmark and
                                    takes into consideration the dependence of the industry of
                                    Denmark on importations of raw materials from Germany and the
                                    necessity for the Danish farmers of selling their cattle and

                                    political duty for the Danish Government to endeavour to promote
                                    good neighbourly relations with Germany, and the necessity of
                                    this policy during the present war conditions is surely
                                    self-evident. For it must not be overlooked that, whatever may
                                    be the outcome of the war, Germany will always remain the
                                    nearest neighbour of Denmark and, whether victorious or
                                    defeated, will always have a deciding influence on the political
                                    and economical life of Denmark.</p>
                                <p>Therefore, just as it is politically and economically necessary
                                    for us to endeavour to continue our exportation to the West, it
                                    is also indispensable to maintain our exportation to the
                                    South.</p>
                                <p>Furthermore, any other procedure or tendency on the part of
                                    Denmark would be a violation of the determination of the Danish
                                    Government declared at the beginning of the war and often
                                    repeated since then, to maintain an equal and impartial
                                    neutrality towards both of the belligerent groups of
                                    countries.</p>
                                <p>Denmark has thus continued to trade with and to export its own
                                    products to both of the belligerent groups, as it was our right
                                    and our duty, and Denmark has also in accordance with the fifth
                                    Hague Convention impartially and loyally towards both parties
                                    carried out such restrictions of free commerce and trade which
                                    the Government during the war found it necessary to establish,
                                    although in their effect these restrictions, and especially the
                                    embargoes, were almost exclusively to the detriment of Germany,
                                    which might easily have led to political consequences reaching
                                    far beyond their real economical importance.</p>
                                <p>The Danish embargoes have given to the Allied powers, in
                                    connection with their efforts to the effect of blockading
                                    Germany, an absolute guarantee that imported articles were not
                                    reexported from Denmark, and the United States now also has this
                                    guarantee with regard to the export to Denmark of articles
                                    necessary for the Danish agriculture, such as for instance
                                    feedstuffs and petroleum.</p>
                                <p>Owing to the measures taken by the belligerents with regard to
                                    the final destination of all articles, it became necessary for
                                    the Danish Government to delegate the work in connection
                                    herewith to the Danish commercial and industrial organizations,
                                    and the Danish Government has in every possible way supported
                                    these organizations in the task thus undertaken by them.</p>
                                <p>When owing to the beginning of the submarine war in 1915 and to
                                    the British counter-measures the question of provisions became
                                    foremost in Germany, the exportation of agricultural products
                                    from Denmark to England, which our farmers had conscientiously
                                    continued in spite of the low prices in England as compared with
                                    the <pb n="1026" xml:id="pg_1026" facs="0272"/>ever increasing
                                    costs of production, was in danger of being stopped by the
                                    German naval forces.</p>
                                <p>For it must in this connection be remembered that the Danish
                                    waters are within the sphere of operation of the German Navy and
                                    that the German Navy has it in its power to stop our exportation
                                    at any moment.</p>
                                <p>But by negotiations at Berlin the Danish Government obtained that
                                    our exportation to England of our agricultural products could be
                                    continued, provided that Germany received her part of our
                                    agricultural export, and that on the other hand England did not
                                    place any obstacles in the way of the importation to Denmark of
                                    articles necessary for our agriculture, especially
                                    feedstuffs.</p>
                                <p>This question of importations to Denmark is of all absorbing
                                    importance, for it is the argument which on the part of the
                                    Danish Government has been successfully used in negotiations
                                    with Germany for the purpose of making exportation from Denmark
                                    to England possible. If importations are suppressed, no reason
                                    remains for Germany to allow exportations to England.</p>
                                <p>This arrangement which has not assumed a fixed and concrete form,
                                    and which here has only been indicated in its great lines, is
                                    the main point and turning-point of the political relations
                                    between Denmark and the two great adversaries: England and
                                    Germany.</p>
                                <p>The British Government has repeatedly declared in the British
                                    Parliament that both the Danish Government and the Danish people
                                    had conscientiously and loyally carried out the engagements that
                                    had been undertaken. The British Government has evidently also
                                    been forced to recognize that the policy followed by the Danish
                                    Government was the correct policy, for, in spite of the loud
                                    accusations against Denmark by a certain extreme part of the
                                    daily press, no demand has ever been made by the Allied powers
                                    that Denmark should establish still further restrictions with
                                    regard to imported articles to the effect that animal products
                                    indirectly produced by such imported articles should only be
                                    exported to the Allied powers.</p>
                                <p>It has indeed been rumored that the Allied powers were now
                                    endeavouring to induce the American Government to issue such
                                    drastic orders with regard to the use made of feedstuffs, etc.,
                                    imported into Denmark from the United States.</p>
                                <p>The Danish Government wishes in these circumstances to again
                                    declare that there is absolute security against reexportation
                                    from Denmark of the said importations from America, and admits
                                    being unable to perceive for what reasons the American
                                    Government should contemplate changing their policy towards
                                    Denmark (and the other Scandinavian countries) and making
                                    exportations conditional upon restrictions with regard to the
                                    use of the exported articles, <pb n="1027" xml:id="pg_1027"
                                        facs="0273"/>such as the British Government on its own
                                    behalf and on behalf of the Allied Governments after three
                                    years’ warfare has not considered it expedient to demand.</p>
                                <p>It is believed that too much importance is attached to the export
                                    from Denmark to Germany, which however is insignificant as
                                    compared with the population of Germany of about seventy
                                    millions, and surely can have no influence on the progress of
                                    the war.</p>
                                <p>All that would be accomplished by a policy of such drastic nature
                                    would be, that Germany would cut all exportation off from
                                    Denmark to England, a situation which would lead to the
                                    economical ruin of Denmark and create serious political
                                    difficulties for us in our relations with Germany. Such a policy
                                    would consequently not in any way do harm to Germany. It has
                                    invariably been the case during the present war with every
                                    encroachment from one or the other side of the belligerents, and
                                    it would be the case again here, that the real loser would be
                                    Denmark, not the other belligerent.</p>
                                <p>A policy of this extreme nature would finally not be in
                                    accordance with the policy which the American Government
                                    championed so valiantly, while as a neutral it had to defend the
                                    rights and duties of neutrals and thereby vigorously assisted
                                    the small nations in their struggle to preserve the rights of
                                    the neutrals as recognized by international law.</p>
                                <p>This being so, and the British Government not having thought it
                                    wise or expedient to change their blockade policy towards the
                                    neutrals in the direction under discussion, it would seem that
                                    there would be so much the more occasion for the Government of
                                    the United States to consider, whether it would be politically
                                    wise for them to do, what the other Allied powers from political
                                    motives have hereunto abstained from doing, because they
                                    recognized the weight and correctness of the arguments here set
                                    forth and explained.</p>

                                foodstuffs and other merchandise have been exported from
                                Scandinavian countries to Germany. This is especially true of Sweden
                                and Denmark. British Minister informs me that reason his Government
                                has adhered to policy of permitting continuance these exportations
                                    <pb n="1028" xml:id="pg_1028" facs="0274"/>from Denmark to
                                Germany is that England felt that to compel Denmark not to export to
                                Germany would result in Germany’s occupation of Denmark which was
                                undesirable. This question of exports to Germany is of vital
                                importance in connection with the feeding of Germany. Before any
                                licenses are granted permitting exportation from America to
                                Scandinavia, I earnestly recommend that agreement be secured from
                                the Scandinavian Governments effectively to embargo all exports of
                                foodstuffs to Germany and that Swedish Government also agree without
                                other compensation to permit all merchandise not included in Swedish
                                decree of January, 1915, that is to say munitions of war, freely to
                                pass through Sweden to Russia.</p>
                            <p>The British Minister and myself are convinced that it is absolutely
                                essential to Sweden’s economic life that she continue to procure
                                coal from Germany. As pointed out in my 348,<note n="1"
                                    xml:id="d153fn2">Not printed.</note> Sweden is now securing her
                                coal supply from this source in return for exports to Germany which
                                have been of untold value to that country. Germany will endeavor to
                                compel Sweden to continue exportation foodstuffs. It is thought that
                                the need in Germany for Swedish iron and steel, ore and woodpulp is
                                such that she will continue to furnish Sweden with coal in return
                                for these commodities.</p>

                                Ministers here and it is our joint opinion, for political reasons
                                and in view of the fact that Norway has rendered special services to
                                the Allies, that a distinction should be made by the United States
                                Government in the treatment to be accorded the three Scandinavian
                                countries in regard to exports from the United States. I therefore
                                take the liberty of suggesting to the Department that when
                                considering the question of regulation of exports Norway should, if
                                possible, be subjected to less restrictions than Sweden or Denmark,
                                the two latter countries having rendered no special services to the
                                Allies. I am forwarding by mail strictly confidential statistics
                                tending to show that Norway’s trade with the enemy has already been
                                limited as much as was possible prior to entry of the United States
                                into the war. It is apprehended that too <pb n="1029"

                                Government of the United States toward Norway may react to the

                                the other two Scandinavian countries are concerned.</p>

                            <p>The British Embassy was instructed a few days ago to bring urgently
                                to the attention of the Government of the United States the large
                                shipments of iron ore which were going from Sweden to Germany. These
                                shipments come very largely from the Gulf of Bothnia via the Kiel
                                Canal and through German and Dutch territorial waters where it is
                                impossible to intercept them. The same instructions drew the
                                attention of the Embassy also to certain recent evidence of very
                                large exports of copper ore, iron ore, and sulphur pyrites and pulp,
                                besides quantities of preserved meat, cellulose wadding and steel
                                billets. Action was taken on these instructions verbally, but no
                                official statement on the subject was made to the United States
                                Government in writing.</p>
                            <p>Now, further information has reached the Embassy which makes the
                                situation even more grave and urgent.</p>
                            <p>One item of information is that in the three weeks ending June 16th,
                                83,000 tons of iron ore was exported to Germany from the one port of
                                Oxelösund alone.</p>
                            <p>Fuller information states that in the two months, May and June last
                                (the shipping season begins on the 1st May) the Swedes have shipped
                                465,000 tons of iron from Lulea and Oxelösund. They hope to ship
                                during this season two and one-half million tons which they will be
                                able to do at their present rate of shipment unless some steps are
                                taken to prevent it. If they succeed in transporting this quantity,
                                German requirements will be covered up to the end of 1918. Ore is
                                pouring into every available German port, especially Stettin,
                                Lübeck, Hamburg, and Emden. Last year large quantities went via
                                Rotterdam but none appear to have gone by this route since January
                                23rd of this year. Stettin is however already blocked with traffic
                                and when the other German ports are filled it is anticipated that
                                traffic via Rotterdam will recommence.</p>
                            <p>The vast importance of these exports of iron ore to Germany is due to
                                the fact that the Germans have built up their munition works and
                                their pig-iron and steel industries to deal with these high-grade
                                    <pb n="1030" xml:id="pg_1030" facs="0276"/>Swedish ores. If
                                these ores were cut off, all munition works would have to be
                                reorganized so as to deal with inferior ores and the pig-iron and
                                steel industries would be seriously in danger.</p>
                            <p>The Swedish Government argue of course that it is absolutely
                                necessary to have to continue this export in exchange for German
                                coal but this argument cannot be accepted until the Swedish
                                Government have at least shown themselves willing to test fully the
                                possibility of obtaining coal from the United Kingdom. The Swedish
                                Government also argue that they are supplying Great Britain also
                                with iron ore. This is true but British requirements of iron ore
                                annually from Sweden are probably less than one-seventh of what
                                Sweden has exported to Germany in each of the years 1915 and
                                1916.</p>
                            <p>In view of these facts the British Government venture to urge upon
                                the Government of the United States that this situation affords an
                                opportunity for strong and effective action at once and that the
                                stoppage of iron ore to Germany should be made the subject of an
                                emphatic demand upon the Swedish Government without delay.</p>

                                request on July 5, which shows that we are fully alive to the
                                considerations you put forward yesterday. I venture-again to urge
                                the importance of some more satisfactory and direct means of
                                obtaining expert information as to the military naval and political
                                situation in Europe, as suggested at the end of that memorandum. We
                                are of course most anxious to continue to furnish you information
                                here where the deliberations of the Exports Council are proceeding,
                                but you will realise that much of the information you require is of
                                the kind which commonly forms the subject of consultations between
                                the Allied Cabinets and General Staffs themselves and that
                                diplomatic discussions on this side of the Atlantic can, in many
                                matters, only convey to you a partial and incomplete-view of plans
                                worked out and contingencies foreseen at London and Paris.</p>
                            <p>On thinking over our conversation, there is one point which I think
                                merits further immediate consideration. If I may say so, I think you
                                are quite right to exact as clear a forecast as possible from us
                                before you embark on the full execution of a policy towards Norway,
                                Denmark and Holland, even though the broad lines on that policy and
                                the concrete ends we hope to gain are clear enough. Moreover, though
                                all these questions are urgent in view of the present stage of the
                                war, there is a sense in which the question of Danish and Dutch food
                                exports to Germany can be suspended for a week or two without too
                                serious consequences. A month lost in these matters might at worst
                                prolong the war a month. In the case of Swedish exports of ore,
                                however, a month lost now may make all the difference between
                                gravely disturbing Germany’s munitions resources-before the end of
                                the war on the one hand and on the other allowing her to protect
                                herself fully up to the end of the war. As you know, the continuance
                                of Swedish exports of iron ore for the rest of the Baltic shipping
                                season will result in fully protecting German resources up to the
                                end of 1918.</p>
                            <p>Now, in the case of Sweden, we have to reckon with hardly any of the
                                doubtful factors on which you insisted yesterday.</p>
                            <p>To take first the military situation. Up to the end of 1916, to give
                                a rough date, we were very apprehensive of pressing Sweden too far.
                                So far as the British Government were concerned, we did not indeed,
                                believe that Sweden would ever throw in her lot with Germany, but
                                the Russian Government represented so strongly the disastrous
                                effects on the military situation of any threat to Russian
                                communications in Finland that we had perforce to adopt a cautious
                                attitude at the behest of our ally. Our preoccupations are pretty
                                    <pb n="1032" xml:id="pg_1032" facs="0278"/>clearly set forth in
                                the enclosed secret memorandum, drawn up in the Foreign Office at
                                the end of last year, which I hope you will regard as very strictly
                                    confidential.<note n="1" xml:id="d156fn3">Not printed.</note>
                            </p>
                            <p>In the first few months of this year, however, our apprehensions
                                diminished and we finally came to the settled conclusion that the
                                possibility of Sweden taking Germany’s part actively might be ruled
                                out of consideration. We have proved this conclusion by practically
                                blockading Sweden this spring and we have wrung from her in this way
                                a most important concession in the form of the release of our
                                merchant ships from the Baltic. We have no longer any fear that
                                Sweden might go to war with us.</p>
                            <p>
                                <hi rend="italic">Per contra</hi>, real attack by Germany on Sweden
                                would be the most serious military adventure she could undertake—so
                                serious that the possibility of it need hardly be entertained. As to
                                naval or air raids, Germany could only lose by such an outrage. The
                                Socialist leader, Herr Branting, has urged in the past that Sweden
                                should stop her exports of iron ore to Germany until Germany
                                abandoned her submarine methods. Any armed raid on Sweden would
                                merely make this policy inevitable for it would assuredly throw the
                                pending election into the hands of the Liberals and Socialists and
                                ruin the chances of the pro-German Conservatives. A Liberal
                                Government carried into power on a wave of popular resentment
                                against Germany could not yield to her pressure but would have no
                                course but to break with her finally.</p>
                            <p>As regards our agreements, we have practically none with Sweden and
                                have a practically free hand to join with you in any embargo policy,
                                however drastic. We have only three agreements with the Swedish
                                Government, namely, those relating to rations of cotton and
                                lubricants, and that providing for the importation into Sweden of
                                Norwegian and Icelandic herrings. Besides these we have agreements
                                with various oil companies, providing for rations of mineral oils.
                                There are just two other agreements with individual firms, one with
                                the International Harvester Co. of Chicago, and one with the
                                Goodrich Rubber Co. of London. The former of these two agreements
                                and the regulation of all rations of cotton, lubricants and mineral
                                oil are now in practice under the control of the United States
                                Government, and not of the British Government—or will be as soon as
                                the United States Government have prohibited the export of cotton.
                                The agreement with the Goodrich Rubber Co. does not bind His
                                Majesty’s Government to license exports to Sweden, and neither of
                                course does the passage of Icelandic and Norwegian herring into
                                Sweden come under the control of any British licensing
                                authority.</p>
                            <pb n="1033" xml:id="pg_1033" facs="0279"/>
                            <p>There is one further agreement with the Swedish Government dating
                                back to December, 1914, in which the British and French Governments
                                engaged generally to permit Sweden to import from Allied countries
                                materials or goods for the wants of Sweden “in so far as the same
                                materials or goods shall not be absolutely necessary for consumption
                                in Great Britain or in France, and providing also that such goods
                                and the products manufactured therefrom are placed on the Swedish
                                prohibited exports list.” This undertaking is, however, of a very
                                indeterminate nature. Its actual character may be tested by the fact
                                that during the whole of the five months, January to May of this
                                year, during part of which time Swedish imports were being largely
                                cut off, only the following goods were imported into Sweden from the
                                British Empire: <table rows="14" cols="2">

                                tons were imported into Sweden from the British Empire, excluding
                                coal.</p>
                            <p>I think there is no doubt that most if not all even of these exports
                                could be cut off absolutely during such period as the United States
                                may be pressing demands on Sweden, except two classes of
                                commodities. The first of these commodities is, of course, coal,
                                which for obvious reasons it would be undesirable to cut off, and
                                the second is raw materials or semi-raw materials, exported to
                                Sweden on behalf of the Ministry of Munitions to firms manufacturing
                                for the Allies. An instance of such exports during the first five
                                months of this year is the 1,562 tons of zinc. Some of the above
                                exports have already been embargoed since the beginning of the year:
                                e. g., animal and vegetable oils and fats as from May 29, tar as
                                from May 2, and vegetable fibres as from March 13.</p>
                            <p>His Majesty’s Government have just offered the Swedish shipowners to
                                supply Sweden with as much coal as she needs in return for the
                                proper employment of Swedish ships.</p>
                            <p>As regards mineral oils and lubricants His Majesty’s Government, in
                                return for a very recent undertaking by Sweden to enforce the <pb

                                of all fish caught by Swedish fishing boats, have agreed not to
                                interfere with the resumption of such shipments, which have been for
                                some time interrupted, on the clear understanding, however, that
                                this agreement is entirely subject to the action decided on by the
                                United States Government in connection with their licensing
                                policy.</p>
                            <p>I think this gives you fairly fully the facts in the case of Sweden.
                                If I were asked to make a suggestion it would be that the more
                                urgent questions relating to Sweden could be taken up at once
                                without waiting for our further reply to the questions raised by you
                                yesterday, and without necessarily involving ourselves in the
                                comprehensive discussion of all our desiderata.</p>
                            <p>As you know, in our view Sweden should be required to stop all
                                exports to Germany; to maintain exports to the Allies; to employ her
                                shipping fully in agreement with you and us, and to guarantee
                                regular transit across her territory to and from Russia. Germany is
                                no longer supplying Sweden with any important commodities; even her
                                coal exports to Sweden have sunk to insignificance; Great Britain is
                                ready to supply Sweden with coal and if there are any commodities
                                from Germany on which Sweden is in some measure dependent, there is
                                nothing that cannot be supplied to her by the Allies. If, however,
                                the Swedish Government could be induced to prohibit all exports of
                                iron, iron ore, steel, copper, pyrites, ferro-chrome,
                                ferro-manganese and ferro-silicon, sulphate and sulphite pulp, and
                                sulphuric acid from Sweden to Germany directly or indirectly, while
                                maintaining her present rate of exports to the Allies, and if they
                                would agree to make this prohibition effective by the end of August,
                                this immediate concession would be so important that, in exchange
                                for it and without entering into any binding agreement not
                                terminable at any moment when it became advisable, it might be worth
                                while to agree to issue licenses for the export to Sweden of the
                                rations of lubricants and mineral oils already fixed in our
                                agreements with the Swedish Government and the oil companies, and
                                also to issue licenses for the ration of cotton provided for in the
                                    <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> between the Swedish
                                Government and the British Government of August, 1916. If Sweden, in
                                response to a demand from the United States, were to accept such a
                                proposal, the United States would still have in hand foodstuffs,
                                copper and other articles for use in the discussions which would
                                follow in regard to Russian transit, shipping, etc., etc., while if
                                Sweden were to refuse, matters would rest where they are at present
                                and we should in no way have compromised our position.</p>
                            <p>I should add that in order to influence the pending elections in
                                Sweden any demands upon Sweden should, Mr. <persName

                                public assurance that we strongly desire to facilitate the
                                maintenance by Sweden of her neutrality.</p>
                            <p>I am so impressed with the urgency of the Swedish iron ore position,
                                and also with your arguments yesterday, that I wish to indicate a
                                method by which it would be possible to make important demands
                                immediately without running the risk either of having to recede from
                                such demands once made or of compromising the attainment of any one
                                of the objects we have in view. I should not have ventured to make
                                these suggestions if you had not asked us yesterday to make clear
                                the kind of negotiations we have had in mind in the case of each
                                neutral country.</p>

                                <hi rend="smallcaps">Your Excellency</hi>: You will be aware, Mr.
                                President, of the extremely difficult conditions under which Norway
                                has laboured during the great war. In her endeavour to maintain a
                                strict and just neutrality she has encountered the same problems and
                                dangers that have met all the neutral countries. Norway’s commercial
                                fleet has been decimated and the lives of her sailors taken by the
                                hundreds on the high seas. Her supplies have to a great extent been
                                cut off and many of her usual sources of supply have been definitely
                                closed for the length of the war.</p>
                            <p>Under these circumstances my country has to look to the United States
                                for the supply of those articles which are required for the
                                maintenance of her people.</p>
                            <p>With the purpose of securing such supplies and among these first of
                                all the things required for the feeding of the Norwegian people, my
                                Government has sent to the United States a mission of experts,
                                headed by me, with the object of taking up with the Government of
                                this country the question of how this purpose can be attained in a
                                manner satisfactory to both countries.</p>
                            <p>In presenting to Your Excellency my credentials as Minister
                                Plenipotentiary on Special Mission, I have the honour on behalf of
                                my Government, to express the earnest conviction that the mission
                                will succeed in placing before the Government of the United States
                                evidence which will leave no doubt as to Norway’s actual
                                position.</p>
                            <p>My Government fully recognize the tremendous demands which are at the

                                <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Minister</hi>: It gives me pleasure to
                                receive from your hands the letters whereby His Majesty, the King of
                                Norway, accredits you as Minister on Special Mission near the
                                Government of the United States, and to accord you formal
                                recognition in that high capacity.</p>
                            <p>The United States having suffered destruction of life and property by
                                the relentless and inhuman tactics employed by Germany, can not fail
                                to deeply sympathize with Norway in the crushing blows which have
                                been inflicted upon her commerce and the lives of her subjects</p>
                            <p>It has been my earnest desire, in this time of strife and unrest,
                                that the United States and Norway, in the conduct of their
                                intercourse, should be animated by a desire and determination to
                                deal justly and helpfully with each other. You are received among us
                                as a representative of a brother nation, both sufferers from the
                                same arbitrary acts, with the assurance that the representatives of
                                your mission will receive the attentive consideration of the
                                officials of this Government.</p>

                            <p>I beg to report to the Department for what it is worth that the
                                Swedish Minister who … has just returned from a visit to Stockholm
                                called upon me a few days ago after having spent the previous
                                evening in the company of German Minister for the purpose of
                                discussing the question of exports from the United States to
                                Scandinavia, explaining that too severe measures would affect the
                                neutrality of Sweden; my replies were entirely non-committal. He
                                then tried to sound me as to the attitude of the United States
                                towards the war and asked my opinion as to its probable duration. I
                                replied that it was impossible for any one to predict duration of
                                the war but that it would certainly continue until we had
                                accomplished our purpose. He said that all the nations now wished
                                for peace and that he knew <pb n="1037" xml:id="pg_1037" facs="0283"
                                />from information received that France ardently desired it. His
                                visit gave me the impression of having an object and his pretext for
                                making it was futile.</p>

                                contemplated to take place at Stockholm. It would be the object of
                                such a conference to discuss the position into which the neutral
                                countries have been brought by America’s entry into the war.</p>

                                    <p>It is a common fact in all these countries that the
                                        conditions are now worse and more severe than they have
                                        perhaps ever been. There will be enough subjects to discuss.
                                        Whether it will be of any avail, however, cannot be
                                        foreseen. The possibility exists, however, that a common
                                        earnest representation on the part of the neutrals setting
                                        forth the difficulties to which they are now subjected will
                                        find hearing and understanding.</p>

                            <p>In conversation to-day at Foreign Office it was stated that Stockholm
                                conference was not called to discuss food control question but
                                before continuation of the former conferences held by neutrals.
                                Attention is called, however, to fact that former conferences were
                                only between the Scandinavian countries.</p>

                                Excellency my country is quite largely dependent upon foreign
                                markets for foodstuffs, fodder and many raw materials, absolutely
                                necessary to its industrial life. Ever since the war began we have
                                more and more, because of exhausted supplies or embargoes in the
                                European states, had to look to America for these essentials, and we
                                still must.</p>
                            <p>In view of this, America’s entry into the war and the consequent
                                restrictions on the export, my Government has empowered Mr.
                                    <persName>Axel Robert Nordvall</persName>, who has for some time
                                been here as a Royal delegate, to, along with me, negotiate with
                                Your Excellency’s Government for the purpose of reaching an
                                agreement through which it may be possible to obtain from America
                                foodstuffs and other articles, necessary for the maintenance of our
                                people and industries. The power in question is contained in a cable
                                from Stockholm dated the 9th instant.</p>
                            <p>I beg to add that Mr. <persName>Nordvall</persName> and I are ready
                                to begin negotiations when, where and with whom Your Excellency

                                Minister for Foreign Affairs. <persName
                                    corresp="frus1917Supp02v01#p_LAAA1">Lindman</persName> discussed
                                at length Sweden’s position as regards imports from America. He
                                stated that Sweden was in urgent need of certain articles which are
                                absolute necessities but added that for economic reasons Sweden
                                could never agree entirely <pb n="1039" xml:id="pg_1039" facs="0285"
                                />to discontinue exports to Germany. He pointed out however that
                                during May and June only two thousand head of cattle were exported
                                from Sweden to Germany.</p>

                                states that this year’s crops in Germany are good and that he even
                                has hopes that there will be a surplus of grain as well as of
                                mineral oil which can be exported to Sweden. I queried <persName
                                    corresp="frus1917Supp02v01#p_LAAA1">Lindman</persName> as to the
                                proposed neutral conference at Stockholm, see my 620. He stated that
                                it had nothing to do with the effect upon neutral countries of
                                America’s entry into the war. That this conference had nothing to do
                                with peace negotiations but that it was called to discuss the
                                question of the rights and interests of neutral countries after the
                                close of the war.</p>

                            <p>The following opinion, expressed by the British Minister at

                                enquiries, has been telegraphed by the latter to the British
                                Ambassador.</p>
                            <p>The possibility of Norway being involved in the war owing to some
                                unforeseen incident, such as the sinking of a German submarine in
                                defence of a Norwegian ship, cannot of course be excluded, but the
                                present efforts of Germany to conciliate Norwegian sympathies,
                                though hitherto unsuccessful, confirms the opinion which has already
                                been expressed that the danger of forcing Norway into the war is
                                fully appreciated by the German Government, and will be carefully
                                avoided by them on the ground that any such development would give
                                the enemies of Germany a naval base on the Norwegian coast.</p>
                            <p>It may be true that at the recent interview at Sassnitz, already
                                mentioned to the Department of State, the German representative
                                declared that if Norway cut off all exports to Germany it would mean
                                war, but as this declaration is in complete contradiction with the
                                present attitude of Germany towards Norway, it would appear certain
                                that this is only another instance of the threatening attitude which
                                Germany maintains for the purpose, not merely of frightening the
                                Norwegian Government, but also of providing that Government with an
                                argument which it could advance as an excuse for not acceding to the
                                demands made by the enemies of Germany.</p>

                            <p>1650. Department is informed that the Russian Government is
                                negotiating to ship oil cake to Sweden upon condition that Sweden
                                does not export dairy products to Germany for a period of six weeks.
                                The Department is now carrying on negotiations with Sweden with
                                regard to the whole question of food and feed supplies to that
                                country which includes also the right of transit and the guarantee
                                of tonnage across Sweden of goods to Russia, and it is of the most
                                vital importance that the success of these negotiations should not
                                be endangered at the present moment by any separate arrangement
                                which Russia may undertake, and also that the supply of oil cake to
                                Sweden should not be sufficiently in excess of the actual needs of
                                Sweden to permit of the production of dairy or meat products for
                                export to Germany.</p>
                            <p>Please make clear to the Russian Government that this Government does
                                not seek to interfere in any way with Russian trade with Sweden, but
                                rather to facilitate it on account of Russia’s proximity to Sweden.
                                Moreover, this Government would be glad to cooperate with the
                                Russian Government on the subject of rationing Sweden, and merely
                                takes this opportunity to urge Russia now not to commit herself to
                                the approval of the future export of dairy or meat products from
                                Sweden into Germany. In view of the importance of exercising control
                                over the imports of food supplies or other materials that would
                                benefit our common enemy, it would seem that a satisfactory
                                arrangement for rationing Sweden might be complicated if an
                                undertaking was made now by Russia to permit food exports to Germany
                                after a period of six weeks.</p>
                            <p>Please take this matter up orally and immediately with the Foreign
                                Office and cable the views of the Russian Government.</p>

                                advised by their Governments that they are not in sympathy with

                                and have been instructed to try in discreet way to discourage

                            <p>682. On the 23d instant Swedish Minister for Foreign Affairs
                                delivered a public address in Stockholm in the course of which he
                                said that the Swedish Government would not sever commercial
                                relations with the Central powers as a condition to obtaining
                                foodstuffs from America. He stated that the population of Sweden
                                need not fear a famine during the coming year and that the
                                Government therefore will not be compelled to accept an agreement
                                which is unacceptable to the Swedish people. The Minister for
                                Foreign Affairs added, however, that the Government will endeavor to
                                come to an agreement with the United States. A copy of the address
                                is being forwarded to the Department by mail.<note n="1"

                            <p>1686. Answering your 1650 Minister for Foreign Affairs says Russian
                                Government agreed to ship to Sweden 20,000 tons oil cake in exchange
                                for steel and detonators. Assures me however that shipment to Sweden
                                be strictly limited to aforesaid obligation as steel and detonators
                                already shipped. I have endeavored to impress upon Russian
                                Government as on Department wisdom of confining commerce with Sweden
                                to most restricted limitations as I think Sweden continually
                                shipping to Germany.</p>

                                owner. He enjoys the fullest confidence of his Government and is a

                            <p>In recent conversations with <persName>Lundbohm</persName> I drew out
                                from him that because of his intimate knowledge of steel and iron
                                and American conditions he would probably discuss this phase with
                                our Government. The principal Swedish exports to Germany are now
                                iron and steel. For your information I am quoting below statistics
                                which have been obtained by French secret service in Sweden after
                                much labor and expenditure. French Minister states that these
                                figures are absolutely authentic and correct.</p>

                            <p>5431. The Department authorized an arrangement by which the Belgian
                                Relief obtained approximately 700,000 bushels of wheat from the
                                Swedish authorities here on condition that 270,000 bushels of rye
                                should be released for export to Sweden. The British authorities
                                here countenanced the arrangement, it was accordingly <pb n="1043"
                                    xml:id="pg_1043" facs="0289"/>closed and the wheat has gone to
                                Belgium. We are now informed that the British Government do not see
                                their way to granting a pass for the rye. The Department is thus
                                placed in a very awkward position and it seems clear that if we are
                                to maintain even an appearance of good faith the necessary pass
                                should be issued to permit the uninterrupted passage of this cargo.
                                In the present delicate situation it is most important that no
                                excuse be given for the belief that we are putting pressure on the
                                Swedish people. Granting of pass at this time would doubtless have
                                good effect on Allied cause.</p>

                                representatives of industry asking assistance in obtaining export
                                licenses from the United States. Interested parties always emphasize
                                their purpose to insure goods being used only in this country.
                                Legation acts in the sense of Department’s July 9,<note n="1"

                            <p>This procedure is becoming increasingly unsatisfactory to all
                                concerned in the absence of information about the policy of the

                                present state of uncertainty here which, despite general good will,
                                will be productive of a spirit among Norwegians essentially damaging
                                to our interests, political no less than commercial, if present
                                conditions last much longer.</p>

                            <p>Should we, however, soon undertake the execution of a clear and

                                of September 14 or along other lines tending to the same result, all
                                the pressure now being exerted on the Government of the United
                                States and on this Legation would almost certainly be diverted to
                                the Norwegian Government and probably lead quickly to willingness on
                                the part of the latter to accept our conditions in regard to
                                exports. The mere fact that some people obtain American products
                                with fair regularity has the bad effect, in the absence of knowledge
                                as to our policy, of delaying development of or even partially
                                crippling industry and demoralizing commerce generally in this
                                country; and the measures taken up to the present do not appear to
                                touch the real object in view, namely, to secure cessation of
                                domestic Norwegian export to the enemy besides effective control of
                                our own exports.</p>
                            <p>In view of the foregoing the Legation very respectfully requests more
                                definite information as to the stand the Government of the United

                                        is the first intimation that His Majesty’s Government have

                                        raise no further objection to the shipment of the proposed
                                        consignment of rye to Sweden and will be willing to allow
                                        the vessel carrying this cargo to be inspected at Halifax
                                        instead of in the United Kingdom if the United States
                                        Government so desire but having regard to the ignorance of
                                        the Commission for Relief in Belgium of the actual
                                        conclusion of the negotiations I should be much obliged if
                                        Your Excellency would first confirm the impression conveyed
                                        by your note that the United States Government feel that
                                        they can not properly prevent this rye from reaching Sweden.
                                        His Majesty’s Ambassador at Washington has been informed
                                        accordingly.</p>
                                    <p>I would point out to Your Excellency that it was never the
                                        intention of His Majesty’s Government that the wheat in
                                        question should be secured for the Commission for Relief in
                                        Belgium without granting facilities for the compensating
                                        export of rye to Sweden but that in view of the number of
                                        other cargoes of wheat recently arranged for the Commission
                                        for Relief in Belgium it was hoped that the United States
                                        Government might have found it possible to abandon entirety
                                        the negotiations with the Swedish Government in respect of
                                        these cargoes.</p>

                                neutrality, pointed out the hardships and difficulties <pb n="1046"
                                    xml:id="pg_1046" facs="0292"/>in which the embargo of the United
                                States had placed Denmark and would create for Denmark in the
                                future, and the sacrifices already made by Denmark in the interest
                                of the Entente and the powers joined with the Entente, but at the
                                same time declared the readiness of the Danish Government to at once
                                receive a proposal from the American Government regarding an
                                arrangement on the subject under discussion.</p>
                            <p>The Danish Minister of Foreign Affairs now instructs me by cable to
                                submit to you the earnest request that a proposition as indicated
                                above may be made without delay and an arrangement concluded. The
                                Minister directs me in this connection to say that the American
                                embargo, which at the outset was declared to be intended as a
                                provisional measure only, has now assumed a rather permanent
                                character and that, if a change is not to be expected soon, the
                                effect of the embargo, in connection with the similar measures taken
                                by Great Britain, will undoubtedly be that Denmark will so to speak
                                be thrust into the arms of Germany, not only economically by the
                                fact that Denmark will to an ever increasing degree be dependent
                                upon importations from Germany and Germany in return, well aware of
                                this situation, will in the same proportion increase its demand of
                                compensation from Denmark in quality and value, but also
                                politically, because it can under such circumstances not be avoided
                                that the Danish people by and by becomes convinced that the fate of
                                Denmark is indifferent to the nations now warring against Germany,
                                and that many Danes, whose sympathy is now with the powers of the
                                Entente and those joined with the Entente, will feel themselves
                                drawn towards Germany in the same measure in which Denmark is
                                compelled to look to Germany for obtaining the necessaries for our
                                national life.</p>
                            <p>By a policy of maintaining summary embargoes with regard to Denmark,
                                which are not understood either by the leading men or the masses of
                                the people in Denmark, the Entente powers and the powers joined with
                                them would, therefore, only benefit Germany and increase the
                                influence of Germany in Denmark (and other neutral countries).</p>
                            <p>In representing these facts and arguments most earnestly to you, I

                                influence to the effect that an arrangement as described may be
                                concluded at the earliest possible moment, lending support to our

                            <p>834. British Minister informs me he has received telegram from his
                                Government stating that the American Exports Council has made
                                proposition to Swedish delegates to purchase from Sweden all surplus
                                iron ore<note n="1" xml:id="d175fn1">Note attached, dated Oct. 2,
                                    1917, as the result of an inquiry addressed by the assistant to
                                    the Counselor for the Department of State (<persName
                                        corresp="frus1917Supp02v01#p_AG2">Auchincloss</persName>) to
                                    the Exports Administrative Board: “No such proposition as that
                                    outlined in the telegram was ever made by the Exports
                                    Administrative Board. The only proposition ever made was a
                                    tentative one to take over the entire ore output.”</note> but
                                that Swedish delegates have replied categorically stating that
                                rather than discontinue all exports of ore to Germany Sweden would
                                forego imports from America. British Minister has telegraphed his
                                Government that he believes that Sweden can never be compelled
                                entirely to discontinue ore exports to Germany; that he believes,
                                however, that an arrangement might be made whereby Sweden would
                                greatly curtail her exports to Germany and increase those to the
                                Allies. British Minister has also informed his Government that in
                                his opinion the Allies can make an agreement by which Sweden will be
                                of more benefit to us than to our enemies. I concur with the views
                                of the British Minister.</p>

                                confidential, for your information. Every endeavor will be made to
                                keep you posted. Difficulty has been that so far the discussions
                                have been informal and no decision as to treatment of Sweden and
                                other unneutrals has been arrived at. Pending decision all exports
                                have been more or less held up. The embargo board take the position,
                                and they are encouraged in that position by representatives of the
                                British and French that efforts should be made to cut off all
                                exports from Sweden to Germany in return for shipments from this
                                country. Swedish representatives state that it is impossible to cut
                                off shipment of some commodities particularly ore without running
                                the risk of causing Germany to declare war. At <pb n="1048"
                                    xml:id="pg_1048" facs="0294"/>the same time they state that the
                                shipment of ore is not as important for Germany as we seem to think.
                                They say that Germany has a large stock of ore on hand and it would
                                not make much difference if shipment was cut off. In the same breath
                                they urge that cutting off shipment would seriously affect their
                                relations with Germany. This question is being investigated and
                                Department would be interested to have your views. When the Exports
                                Board reaches a decision they will make recommendation for the
                                approval of the Department and the President. Until President
                                approves of their recommendation no policy can be officially
                                announced. Swedish representatives realize the difficult situation
                                that confronts them and the danger of being cut off. The British
                                seem to urge the policy of demanding that Sweden absolutely cut off
                                Germany. We are trying to look at the matter from all angles and
                                particularly have in mind the possible effect on Russia of Sweden’s
                                throwing in its lot with Germany.</p>
                            <p>Since this Government published German despatches transmitted by
                                Sweden representatives of Allies have stopped all communications by
                                cable between Sweden and this country. They also seized certain bags
                                that <persName>Lundbohm</persName>
                                <note n="1" xml:id="d176fn1">Dr. <persName>Hjalmar

                                brought over with him. The bags are now in Halifax. Department feels
                                that this matter can be pressed too far and has informally
                                recommended that the British be more liberal in their treatment of
                                mail and telegrams. We are awaiting reply through British Embassy.
                                Swedish Counselor is leaving for home this week with pouch. We have
                                suggested to British Government that this be allowed to go through.
                                The bags in Halifax will probably be sent here to the British
                                Embassy, and the suggestion of British Government is that they be
                                opened by the Swedes in the presence of a representative of the
                                British and this Government. We are disposed to accept word of
                                Minister for contents, but matter has not been settled.</p>
                            <p>In regard to treatment of Norway, negotiations are being carried
                                forward. Principal difficulty seems to be the question of large
                                shipments of fish from Norway to Germany. British are anxious to
                                cancel the agreement they have for the purchase of large amount of
                                fish, and at the same time insist on Norway’s seizing shipment to
                                Germany.</p>
                            <p>Negotiations with Denmark have been impeded by failure of
                                representatives of Danish Government to give full information.</p>
                            <p>Negotiations with Holland pending, and no more progress has been made
                                owing to obvious difficulties, political, economic and military.</p>

                            <p>5522. Your 7251, September 25, 4 p.m. You may confirm to British
                                Government impression conveyed by your note that this Government
                                feel they can not properly prevent the rye from reaching Sweden. The
                                arrangement for taking over the wheat for the Belgian Relief was
                                approved by <persName corresp="frus1917Supp02v01#p_PLE1">Lord
                                    Eustace Percy</persName>, and subsequent change of position was
                                most embarrassing. It is hoped the British Government will see their
                                way to granting permit for export of rye to Sweden without delay.
                                Please report by telegraph.</p>

                                Capt. (R.D.N., retired) C. M. T. Cold, Director General of the

                                in order to promote the interests of their companies, and also in
                                order to cooperate with this Legation in our efforts to reach an
                                agreement with the Government of the United States regarding export

                                occupy prominent and highly considered positions in Denmark, and are
                                willing and able to furnish authentic and valuable information on
                                many of the subjects under discussion, I beg to request that you
                                will be good enough to invite the authorities, with which they will
                                have to deal, particularly the Exports Council, the Exports
                                Administrative Board and the U. S. Shipping Board, to receive them
                                favorably and to give earnest consideration to any matter which they
                                may submit to the said authorities with a view to reaching the
                                understanding which is highly needed and, I venture to think,
                                equally desired from both sides.</p>
                            <p>Messrs. Cold and Prior are already in this city, and I would be much
                                obliged to you for informing the said authorities as soon as may be

                                >Polk</persName>:</p>
                            <p>Thanks for your 363. Shall greatly appreciate being kept in touch
                                with situation.</p>
                            <p>In reply to your request for my views: As previously stated in my No.
                                834,1 do not believe that it could be arranged with the Swedish
                                Government that iron ore shipments to Germany could be discontinued;
                                neither do I think it would be advisable to try to force complete
                                cessation of ore shipments to Germany on this point. All the Allied
                                Ministers, Stockholm, have at various times, expressed the same
                                feeling.</p>
                            <p>The old Government has now resigned and all the Allied Ministers here
                                feel that the new Administration will be composed of
                                Socialist-Liberal element and will be more favorable to the Allies.
                                Therefore, I suggest delaying negotiations with the Swedish
                                commission composed of <persName>Lundbohm</persName> and
                                    <persName>Nordvall</persName>, who are now in America, until
                                result of formation of new Government is known. Should the Liberal
                                Government come in it would be important to have representatives in
                                the Swedish delegation chosen by new Government who will reflect
                                their ideas. When the new Government comes in undoubtedly large
                                advantages can be arranged for by the Allies without forcing the
                                issue too far and creating friction. My British colleague is in
                                sympathy with me in this point of view. Regarding ore shipments to
                                Germany which is by far the most important export and which, <pb
                                    n="1051" xml:id="pg_1051" facs="0297"/>based on previous
                                figures, will probably total more than four million tons this year,
                                I would refer to my telegram No. 860<note n="1" xml:id="d180fn1">Not
                                    printed.</note> which ought to be taken into consideration in
                                connection with this entire matter. Referring to what you say

                                the Department’s views in not being too severe and in being careful
                                not to do anything which would unnecessarily make

                                provided it is made up as is expected of a Liberal-Socialist
                                cabinet, and if cabinet proves favorable to the Allies I think our
                                policy towards Sweden should be guided accordingly so as to derive
                                the most benefit. I should like to say that the change in the
                                Government as anticipated would be most important as affecting the
                                political conditions of Sweden and also the Swedish Government point
                                of view towards Germany and the Allies.</p>

                            <p>1398. The danger of Denmark’s being forced to make compensation to
                                Germany to secure fuel oil for the electric light and water works is
                                growing. Even an expression of opinion from our Government on the
                                subject might help to allay irritation and astonishment that an
                                embargo, which can only injure our interests here, continues. Our
                                allies, the British, declare that it is not their fault.</p>

                            <p>346. My telegram No. 341, October 14, 2 p.m.<note n="1"
                                    xml:id="d184fn1">Not printed.</note> I was not able to see the
                                Minister for Foreign Affairs until to-day. He volunteered no
                                information on the subject of his Government’s attitude with regard
                                to American exports until I broached the subject. I mentioned that
                                the French Minister had spoken to me as reported in my telegram 341.
                                Minister for Foreign Affairs said he had called French Minister
                                because of receipt of a telegram from Norwegian Minister to France
                                reporting that in his opinion the time had come when the question of
                                Norwegian imports might profitably be discussed with the Allies.
                                Minister of Foreign Affairs continued in the sense of my 341,
                                substantially confirming French Minister’s statement. I inquired
                                whether Minister for Foreign Affairs had a proposal to make and
                                received a negative reply. He said that Norwegian Government was
                                merely ready to discuss the question and suggested that it might be
                                discussed either here or at Paris or London or at Washington by
                                Norwegian commissioners who have received instructions. I asked him
                                what was meant by reduction in exports to Germany which he had
                                stated Norwegian Government was prepared to make. This he stated
                                would be the subject of discussion; I did not suggest total embargo
                                against Germany but am <pb n="1053" xml:id="pg_1053" facs="0299"
                                />inclined to think that Minister for Foreign Affairs realized our
                                demand was likely to involve it although it may be natural for him
                                not to have given any intimation of this realization.</p>
                            <p>My general impression, as suggested in my cipher telegram 339,
                                October 11, 2 p.m.,<note n="1" xml:id="d184fn2">Not printed.</note>
                                is that this Government is not yet committed to outright acceptance
                                of the conditions it is assumed that the United States will lay
                                down. It appears to be waiting to be approached by us. Obviously our
                                position would be stronger if we wait until Norwegian Government
                                comes to us with proposals of some sort; it might do so soon
                                considering increasing exhaustion of stocks here. But on the other
                                hand the question may be settled more quickly if we take an early
                                opportunity to state our terms and of course we must consider
                                Swedish pressure. In any case total embargo against the enemy must
                                be guiding principle of our policy towards Norway.</p>
                            <p>I understand that for some time past trade relations between Norway
                                and the United States have been a subject of regular discussion
                                between the Foreign Minister and the German Minister at every
                                conference between them. While the Minister for Foreign Affairs
                                still speaks of impossibility of total elimination of all exports to
                                the enemy on account of danger of retaliation, it seems to be
                                growing clearer that his expression of fear on that score is
                                becoming less sincere. The logic of the situation would also seem to
                                point away from the probability of such danger since it is
                                apparently realized that German retaliation on Norway would improve
                                the naval situation of the Allies who are thought here not to be
                                averse to such an eventuality.</p>
                            <p>What attitude does the Department desire this Legation to take?</p>

                                    908</ref>.</note> until October 19. The Minister for Foreign
                                Affairs in open session of the Storthing yesterday explained the
                                reasons for the delay in a long speech. The speech was occasioned by
                                accusations in the press against him for having kept the country in
                                ignorance of the contents of the note, which it is alleged
                                foreshadowed a serious situation for Norway, and for the Government
                                having failed in consequence to take necessary measures to provide
                                against this contingency. The Minister for Foreign Affairs stated
                                that communications from the Norwegian Minister at Washington led
                                him to presume that the note was not important and that no reference
                                was made to it in despatches and telegrams from Washington either
                                from the Norwegian Minister or the Norwegian commission before the
                                receipt of a copy at the Foreign Office on October 19. The Minister
                                for Foreign Affairs gave a summary of the note and it was
                                unanimously decided to discuss his speech at a later session of the
                                Storthing. Immediately after making it he sent for me and requested
                                me to inform you that he was extremely sorry that the note had not
                                been properly handled and that he hoped the unfortunate occurrence
                                would not affect the existing good relations between the United
                                States and Norway as the delay had been quite unintentional on his
                                part; he seemed to be extremely disturbed about the whole matter and
                                I believe that momentary situation created by this incident is
                                particularly propitious for securing cooperation of the Norwegian
                                Government with regard to embargo against the enemy. He said that he
                                had requested Minister <persName corresp="frus1917Supp02v01#p_BHH1"
                                    >Bryn</persName> to obtain permission of the United States
                                Government to publish the note in its entirety, that <persName
                                    corresp="frus1917Supp02v01#p_BHH1">Bryn</persName> had replied
                                that the United States Government was willing that this should be
                                done, but that the Norwegian commission advised that only a summary
                                of it be published. It is apparent that whatever may have been the
                                cause or possibly the motive of the delay the Minister for Foreign
                                Affairs is endeavoring to lay the responsibility on the Norwegian
                                representatives in Washington. The matter has been reported fully in
                                my despatches Nos. 542 and 546<note n="1" xml:id="d186fn3">Not

                            <p>947. I wish to report that the feeling of resentment towards America
                                among a large part of the Swedish population is increasing daily and
                                this feeling, which is now becoming one of bitterness, is manifested
                                and stimulated by the Swedish press in articles which deal with
                                American subjects, such for example as the press stating that they
                                receive letters from Swedes who have come from America, that Swedish
                                subjects are against their will being drafted into the American
                                Army. One also experiences this anti-American feeling in public as
                                occasion and opportunity arise. This, as I previously cabled, is due
                                primarily to the cutting off of Sweden from food supplies. As I
                                cabled before, the prices of food and living have become beyond all
                                reason and even the necessities of life have become beyond the reach
                                of many, while many articles of food are practically unobtainable. I
                                am informed by people who have made a study of the prices in various
                                countries throughout the war, that the food prices of Sweden are
                                higher to-day than exist in any country in the world.</p>
                            <p>This feeling above mentioned is helped along by German propaganda as
                                the Germans take every advantage which arises towards increasing the
                                bitterness. In connection with embargo on exports to Sweden I would
                                respectfully refer again to my 834<note n="1" xml:id="d187fn1">

                                        1047</ref>.</note> and would again emphasize that I do not
                                believe it is practicable or feasible to try and have Sweden
                                discontinue entirely their trade with Germany. Even with the new
                                Administration, which I believe to be kindly disposed to the Allies,
                                I do not think they would entertain a proposition of entirely
                                cutting off export to Germany and in trying to do so it would
                                increase the feeling already existing which I have described.
                                However, I do not believe that in the future even with an adjusted
                                food embargo great advantage can be gained in Sweden for the Allies
                                most of which advantages Germany has heretofore received. It is also
                                interesting to know that I am reliably informed that Sweden has now
                                contracted for three thousand tons lubricating oil from Germany and
                                it is probable that Sweden will try to continue making arrangements
                                for further supplies of other commodities from Germany, all of which
                                tends towards making the relationship between Sweden and Germany
                                more intimate.</p>

                                substance of recent Foreign Office telegrams about Denmark. The
                                following is the substance of two telegrams: <list>
                                    <label>1.</label>
                                    <item>It seems agreed that in the case of Denmark it may be
                                        necessary to concede the principle of certain exports of
                                        fish and cattle to Germany. We hope however to secure a
                                        fuller interruption of trade with Germany in the cases of
                                        Norway and Holland and if these countries knew that we were
                                        prepared to make concessions to Denmark that knowledge could
                                        not fail to stiffen their attitude towards us. It would be
                                        prudent to avoid this possible complication by allowing the
                                        Danish negotiations to stand over until we have settled with
                                        the other countries.</item>
                                    <label>2.</label>
                                    <item>The draft agreement with Denmark enclosed in your despatch
                                        of October 19th fixes figures for rations on which we should
                                        like to make detailed comments and, in some cases,
                                        counter-proposals. We are preparing and sending out
                                        material. We have arrived at a complete understanding with
                                        the French Government as to figures for rations for all
                                        northern neutrals which will be telegraphed to you shortly,
                                        but we should like to discuss the figures for Denmark with
                                        American and French and possibly also Russian delegates here
                                        before they are finally fixed. For this reason also we
                                        should welcome the postponement of a definite proposal to
                                        the Danish Government.</item>

                            <p>I should add that, while the first telegram above is not a new
                                element in the discussion, as it represents a view which has more
                                than once been informally discussed with the War Trade Board, the
                                second does somewhat go back on the statement made previously to the
                                board under instructions from London that we were prepared to accept
                                the rations provisionally fixed by Doctor <persName
                                    corresp="frus1917Supp02v01#p_TAE1">Taylor</persName> as an
                                inducement to Denmark to accept our last proposals. The change is
                                due to the fact that the full text which the Foreign Office now has
                                is more complete than the summary which we had telegraphed. In view
                                of this change, I am sending a copy of this letter to Mr.

                                    <p>If you find that entire cessation of all exports to the enemy
                                        is unattainable without undue delay you may offer concession
                                        in the matter of fish exports. We should be prepared in the
                                        last resort to agree to such export up to a maximum of forty
                                        thousand tons per annum in fixed monthly installments; the
                                        term fish should include every description of fish and fish
                                        products, the weight being calculated on the basis of the
                                        amount of freshly caught fish represented in the products
                                        derived therefrom.</p>
                                    <p>Enemy armies are largely supplied with Norwegian canned goods
                                        and you should therefore make a special point of suitably
                                        limiting proportion of the fish exports to the enemy which
                                        may be sent in form of canned goods.</p>
                                    <p>Confidential. It is important that Norwegian negotiations
                                        shall be completed as rapidly as possible since the
                                        negotiations with Denmark are being gracefully held up till
                                        that happens.</p>

                            <p>For your information. The British will add to their telegram the

                            <p>It is hoped that only one more conference here will be necessary to

                            <p>I have just had a conference with <persName
                                    corresp="frus1917Supp02v01#p_HJ1">Hellner</persName>, Foreign
                                Minister of the newly appointed Liberal-Socialist Government. In
                                this conference he asked me to inform you in a general way of the
                                desire of the new Government to come to some arrangement between
                                Sweden and the Allies. He outlined basis upon which Sweden would be
                                willing to initiate negotiations looking to the consummation of an
                                agreement with the Allies. I do not think that the basis as outlined
                                is final with the Swedish Government and I believe that further
                                concessions particularly as to tonnage might be obtained. I did not
                                express any opinion to <persName corresp="frus1917Supp02v01#p_HJ1"

                                which he discussed but I told him that I would immediately cable
                                same to you. He desired to state that the Swedish Government wishes
                                to appoint two commissioners empowered to negotiate on this

                                Enskilda Bank, and Mr. <persName>Carl Carlson</persName>, an
                                influential steamship man. He wishes to know whether it would be the
                                desire of our Government to meet in London or in Washington
                                regarding these negotiations and when. In either event he stated it
                                would be his intention to have the present commissioners, who are
                                now in America, remain in Washington for the time being.</p>
                            <p>I have learned from my British colleague that his Government have
                                wired their Ambassador in Washington to try to have these
                                negotiations carried on from London, claiming that London is more
                                central and easier of access to handle these matters. The Foreign
                                Minister had a similar conference with the British Minister who has
                                cabled his Government likewise. Therefore, I request a reply to give
                                the Foreign Minister as to your disposition regarding carrying on
                                these negotiations, and at what place and when.</p>
                            <p>The British and French Ministers and myself have conferred upon this
                                matter and we are all in accord that now is an opportune time for
                                these negotiations, and we furthermore feel that it is highly
                                probable a beneficial arrangement can be made with this <pb n="1062"
                                    xml:id="pg_1062" facs="0308"/>present Government who are kindly
                                disposed toward the Allies. We feel that if no arrangement is made
                                with this Government it is probable that they will continue becoming
                                more intimate with and closer to Germany both commercially and
                                otherwise. In a conversation with Foreign Minister he confirmed to
                                me that Sweden had purchased from Germany three thousand tons of
                                lubricating oil. Also he inquired of British Minister whether it
                                would prejudice Sweden’s cause with the Allies if Sweden accept from
                                Germany grain and other supplies. My colleagues and myself feel that
                                the points which they bring out for discussion in making an
                                arrangement, which basis I quote below, are entirely different from
                                anything which the Swedish Government have been willing to make up
                                to the present time. It is so encouraging that we feel quite
                                sanguine that some mutually satisfactory arrangement now can be
                                made. I also wish to draw Department’s attention to my telegram
                                    947<note n="1" xml:id="d194fn1">

                                developed in Sweden due primarily to the embargo. Allied Ministers
                                and myself are of the opinion, as I telegraphed previously, that it
                                is not feasible nor practicable for Sweden entirely to discontinue
                                trading with Germany and that it would be a mistake to ask her to do
                                so and my colleagues have telegraphed their Governments in this
                                light. As an example, if Sweden were compelled to entirely
                                discontinue trading with Germany they would be unable to get coal
                                from England except in very limited amounts. Should Sweden be cut
                                off from obtaining coal from Germany you can readily see the natural
                                results which would ensue to Sweden’s economic life and how it would
                                affect their industrial life as well as transportation. From what I
                                learn and also my conversation with <persName
                                    corresp="frus1917Supp02v01#p_HJ1">Hellner</persName> it seems
                                that the Swedish Government is of the opinion that it is America
                                particularly who wishes to stop Sweden’s trading with Germany. In
                                the opinion of myself and Allied colleagues no time should be lost
                                in arranging to meet the Swedish delegates for a conference on these
                                matters. The following is the basis <persName

                                            >Hellner</persName> asked if this question could be
                                        satisfactorily settled by assurance on the part of Swedish
                                        Government that they would grant transit licenses freely
                                        without direct compensation. He explained that Swedish
                                        Government preferred not to abolish present system by which
                                        export prohibitions applied to transit goods as well as
                                        goods of Swedish origin. My opinion is that if prohibition
                                        of export was raised as regards transit goods we should have
                                        far greater difficulty in controlling transit traffic and
                                        deviations would be much more frequent. <persName

                                        said that the Swedish Government would have to make

                            <p>1566. As was to be expected the Italian defeats have made a profound
                                impression in Denmark. In the Danish mind the invincibility of the
                                German arms is once again demonstrated and always having cringed
                                before the mailed monster, they are totally unable to comprehend how
                                we can think of continuing the war. They ask the question and greet
                                the reply with raised hands and a groan for they know that these
                                reverses will only spur America and her allies on to more determined
                                efforts which must include a more relentless enforcement of the
                                embargo against the Central powers. With their nerves in such a
                                state, a whole-hearted response to the demands of our War Trade
                                Board can hardly be expected.</p>
                            <p>The recent twenty-four hours’ visit of the King of Sweden was
                                uneventful. The only passages in the otherwise stereotyped toasts
                                exchanged at the banquet table declared the determination to
                                continue economic cooperation. Everything possible was done to
                                divest the visit of any appearance other than that of a return for
                                that which the Danish King made to Stockholm in May last. Doctor
                                    <persName corresp="frus1917Supp02v01#p_EMF1">Egan</persName> has
                                been confidentially informed that the sole question which was
                                officially discussed was that of mutual economic help during the
                                present critical times: that the Norwegian King did not come since
                                he had no visit to return. The three Scandinavian countries are
                                apparently becoming alive to the fact that if put to the test they
                                can supply one another with probably a large majority of the
                                commodities they need for their national life. Recent speeches in
                                Norwegian Storthing are indications of this.</p>

                                by exportation. He is not willing to take part in insisting that
                                there be no export from Norway to Germany as he regards that as
                                inconsistent with the principle upon <pb n="1066" xml:id="pg_1066"
                                    facs="0312"/>which the United States has always insisted and the
                                rights which she has always demanded for herself. In view of above
                                he further directs me to say that in his judgment we cannot in good
                                faith hold up the Danish agreement awaiting any other negotiations.

                                German wishes and is being held for the purpose of keeping Norway in

                                regarding Norwegian tonnage. Sweden negotiations should be conducted

                                gained by your holding present commissioners, new commissioners
                                might be an improvement. Holland negotiations should also be
                                conducted in Washington, D. C. We are conferring with these

                                    <p>In confirmation of my communications to you during our
                                        conversation this morning I beg to state that my Government
                                        desire me to put the following question to the Government of
                                        the United States of America. Would the United States be
                                        able to see their way, as far as their ability goes, to
                                        secure during the length of the present war the necessary
                                        supplies for Norway, if Norway on her side in order to
                                        attain this purpose declares herself willing to lead the
                                        following unusual policy. Norway reduces her trade exchange
                                        with Germany and her allies in the following manner: <list>

                                                that extent which the said agreement makes possible.
                                                Norway has already pledged herself to such an
                                                obligation by this agreement.</item>

                                                bismuth, manganese, mica, nickel, tin, titanium, and

                                    <p>The presupposition will naturally be that Norway pledges
                                        herself to provide that no American goods imported in
                                        accordance with an eventual agreement with you should either
                                        directly or indirectly reach the enemies of the United
                                        States and also that the Norwegian Government in all cases
                                        of export of Norwegian goods to Sweden and Denmark will
                                        procure security that such goods shall not reach Germany or
                                        her allies in any way contrary to such an eventual agreement
                                        with you. It will likewise be the presupposition of such a
                                        possible agreement that the carriage to Norway of goods for
                                        which the United States give license must not be hindered by
                                        seizure from the side of the Allies.<note n="1"

                            <p>Letter seems to us here fair basis for negotiation and accords an
                                opportunity for active negotiation invited by them. Our opinion
                                clear and decided that it would be mistake to throw this matter back
                                to Christiania and that negotiations should be carried on here at
                                once with determination to reach best obtainable solution without

                                based upon same general principle as Danish agreement which I
                                understand President approved, the exception being that our Minister
                                to Norway confirmed by the Ministers of Great Britain and France,
                                believing that the Norwegian Government and people might accept a
                                prohibition of all exports to Germany if we gave them all their
                                needs and also guarantee them a market for their usual exports,
                                desires an opportunity to try this proposal. If total cessation of
                                exports to Germany will not be acceded to, which we doubt, our
                                proposal approves of an export of forty thousand tons of fish which
                                is not far below the amount suggested to us by Doctor <persName

                                left America.</p>
                            <p>We find that a full disclosure of our negotiations with <persName
                                    corresp="frus1917Supp02v01#p_NF1">Nansen</persName> has been
                                withheld from the Norwegian Government and people by the Foreign
                                Minister … and that he has been concealing the true facts, and it is
                                the opinion of those best informed that our proposition would be
                                acceptable to the Government and people.</p>
                            <pb n="1070" xml:id="pg_1070" facs="0316"/>
                            <p>This agreement seems vital to me to prevent the enemy from securing
                                most important materials for munitions and food and does not
                                interfere with Norway’s normal business and cares for her own needs.
                                Delay serious because Germany is now trying to make a trade.</p>

                            <p>386. Pursuant to my telegram No. 382, November 16, reporting meeting
                                of Scandinavian Kings. About ten days ago Swedish Minister here came
                                from Stockholm to Christiania and informed the King of Norway of the
                                desire of the King of Sweden to visit him. Upon learning this Danish
                                Minister here informed his Government and the King of Denmark
                                immediately proposed to come at the same time. It is not improbable,
                                however, that the meeting had been suggested during the recent visit
                                of the King of Sweden to Copenhagen.</p>
                            <p>According to information which I consider absolutely reliable it is
                                anticipated that subjects to be discussed at the meeting on the 28th
                                will be the following: an endeavor on the part of Sweden to secure
                                support of the other two countries with a view to obtaining control
                                of the Aland Islands; the attitude of European neutrals in <pb
                                    n="1071" xml:id="pg_1071" facs="0317"/>regard to future peace
                                proposals on the part of Central powers (there has been considerable
                                peace talk here recently which apparently has its origin in
                                Stockholm); strengthening of Scandinavian cooperation with a view to
                                resisting Allied pressure in regard to import and export
                                situation.</p>

                            <p>390. I learn on good authority that the principal object of the King
                                of Denmark in coming to the Royal conference here November 28 is to
                                prevent this Government from engaging itself to permit the Allies to
                                establish a naval base in Norway in any contingency that may arise.
                                German Minister for Foreign Affairs is believed to have let it be
                                understood that in case the Allies attempt to establish such a base
                                in Norway the German Government will at once scramble for a similar
                                base on the west coast of Denmark. It is not improbable that the
                                foregoing plans have taken shape in consequence of visit of the <pb

                                conference with British, French and Italian representatives and
                                approved after making the following changes:</p>
                            <p>Fish, 25,000 tons if possible, 40,000 tons if necessary. All
                                exportable surplus of fish oil to go to Allies. If maximum amount of
                                fish granted suggest elimination of ferro-silicon. Molybdenite and
                                chrome to be classified under paragraph (4) your cable, and add “any
                                alloys thereof.” Instead of paragraph (3) we recommend, “In
                                consideration the supply by the United States of copper to cover the
                                reasonable domestic needs of Norway, Norway agrees to suspend
                                exportation of copper, cuprous pyrites and ferrous pyrites except to
                                the Allies or approved neutral destination.” Reserve to Allies right
                                to continue present imports of calcium carbide and calcium nitrate,
                                and all supplies of all commodities which the Allies are now
                                receiving to be maintained. We suggest that Holland and Switzerland
                                be included with Denmark and Sweden in all classes of the export
                                Norwegian goods to Germany as suggested in paragraph (4), and that
                                any of these commodities should not release substitutes to
                                Germany.</p>

                                desires us to state that he cannot unreservedly express concurrence
                                in any arrangement which will permit the exportation of the stated
                                amount of calcium carbide and calcium nitrate and desires to lodge a
                                protest with regard to these particular commodities which he
                                considers of great value for munition purposes. He further suggests
                                that his expert advisers also take a strong view as to the
                                desirability of excluding ferro-silicon. He recognizes however that
                                if the negotiations are to be conducted in Washington the
                                authorities there must be left discretion within certain limits to
                                do the best they can for the Allies as a whole.</p>

                                    <p>While your proposal of November 16 is acceptable to us in
                                        principle, we are not in full accord with you upon all of
                                        its details and we therefore desire to make the following
                                        proposal which, if accepted, will permit us to accomplish
                                        the object of these negotiations, that is, to supply your
                                        country with its reasonable requirements, so far as
                                        permitted by our own needs, and in case those requirements
                                        go beyond our own resources, we shall expect to render every
                                        assistance possible to Norway in supplying her needs
                                        elsewhere. We accept your proposal regarding Norway’s fish
                                        export not to exceed 48,000 tons per annum and no export of
                                        fish oil to Central powers conditioned that said tonnage be
                                        measured in terms of fresh fish and the exports shall be in
                                        the same proportions fish and fish products as prevailed to
                                        Central powers during the past year. In consideration that
                                        the United States shall supply copper sufficient to satisfy
                                        the reasonable domestic needs of Norway it should be agreed
                                        by Norway to suspend exportation except to Allies, or
                                        approved neutral destination, of cuprous pyrites and ferrous
                                        pyrites, and copper, excepting such amount of crude or
                                        refined copper as may be necessary in equivalent exchange
                                        for manufactured copper received by Norway, plus 5 per cent
                                        to cover wastage. Since we are to grant export licenses for
                                        kerosene we propose that you sell us all of your exportable
                                        calcium carbide. Norway not to permit the export to the
                                        Central powers of any ferro-silicon or molybdenum in any
                                        form. Since we are to grant export licenses for fertilizers
                                        we propose that you sell to us’ all your exportable calcium
                                        nitrate. Norway will continue her exports to the Allies in
                                        so far as they may require the same. All of the foregoing on

                                        as you furnish us with a complete estimate of your

                                only say here, in regard to these two countries, that my
                                Government’s view is that the desiderata of our associated
                                Governments which have now been put in writing to the Norwegian and
                                Danish Governments should be strongly pressed before further
                                concessions are made.</p>
                            <p>As regards Sweden and Holland, I understand that the American
                                delegates in London approved an invitation to these two countries to
                                send representatives to London to negotiate there. This invitation
                                was sent, but the delegates have now left for Paris and apparently
                                their return is uncertain.</p>
                            <p>We are instructed to press you to let negotiations with Sweden and
                                Holland be begun in London and to express the earnest hope that Mr.

                                to London to take a leading part in such negotiations as soon as
                                their business in Paris is completed. Our reasons for this proposal
                                are as follows: <list>

                                        <hi rend="italic">Sweden</hi>. There is no one in Washington
                                        accredited by the present Swedish Government or representing
                                        their views. The representative now here is an iron ore
                                        expert, but probably not competent to discuss other
                                        subjects. Neither is there anyone here empowered to
                                        represent the Russian Government, while the presence of
                                            <persName>M. Nordmann</persName> in London, who has
                                        strong views on the settlement of the Swedish question,
                                        makes it possible to act there more or less in agreement
                                        with Russian interests, even though joint action in such
                                        matters with the present Russian “Government” is impossible.
                                        Moreover, the Swedish question has such an immediate and
                                        serious military significance that discussions in Europe,
                                        taking into account the changing military factors, seem to
                                        be imperative. My Government can not provide for proper
                                        representation in Washington for negotiations so difficult
                                        as this. I understand the policy of my Government in regard
                                        to Sweden to be as follows: <list>

                                                should be adjourned on the basis of definite

                            <p>On all the first four questions we have already been obliged to open
                                negotiations with or make demands upon Holland, and we have actually
                                practically secured a tonnage arrangement. The fourth point is
                                intimately bound up with our margarine imports from Holland and with
                                our agricultural agreement. The fifth has been the subject of
                                repeated discussions between ourselves and Holland, while the sixth
                                very closely affects the continuance of our agricultural agreement,
                                the well-being of the French and Belgian relief works, and our whole
                                financial stability. Negotiations in London would, therefore, we
                                believe lead to a much speedier and more satisfactory settlement
                                than at Washington where <persName>M. van Vollenhoven</persName> has
                                shown little disposition to discuss any other subject than the Dutch
                                ships now in United States ports. At the back of any such
                                negotiations lies, moreover, the military problem which may at any
                                moment become a very urgent one. We believe we can attain all the
                                objects stated above except the export of Dutch agricultural
                                produce. This has been complicated by the recent German agreement
                                and the main conflict will centre round the export of fats to
                                Germany. The degree to which we can succeed will probably mainly
                                depend on the extension of our agricultural agreement and it is to
                                be feared that if the negotiations are carried on solely at
                                Washington the Dutch representatives will prevent any arrangement by
                                referring to this agree <pb n="1080" xml:id="pg_1080" facs="0326"
                                />merit as the furthest point to which Holland can go and as being
                                satisfactory to the British Government.</p>
                            <p>For all these reasons I trust you will consent to the Swedish and
                                Dutch negotiations beginning in London forthwith in order to secure
                                a speedy and clear definition of the policy of our associated
                                Governments towards the northern neutrals with a view to end the
                                present uncertainty. In so far as that uncertainty arises, as it no
                                doubt does, from defects in British representation at Washington in
                                blockade matters, my Government are all the more anxious to be in a
                                position to discuss these matters with their associates and with
                                neutrals at London, where they can explain their views better and in
                                a manner less likely to cause delay at a moment when their main
                                object is expeditious action.</p>

                            <p>Our No. 17. In view of growing feeling on part northern neutrals
                                against our embargo board are in favor of allowing one or two
                                cargoes to be sent forward at once to Norway, Denmark, Holland and
                                Sweden of selected commodities such as kerosene or coffee or
                                lubricating oil. We believe this would aid negotiations and create
                                better feeling on the part of people in these countries, offsetting
                                some of the German influence. A decision to do this now should have
                                a good effect in these countries at the Christmas season. Please
                                cable your advice to-morrow as must act promptly.</p>

                                        to be able to accede to your proposal that the 48,000 tons
                                        of fish and products of fish for export to Central powers
                                        should be measured in terms of fresh fish. For the sake of
                                        control it is absolutely necessary to have the quantities
                                        stipulated in export weight and thus avoiding the
                                        possibility of dispute. The Norwegian Government must
                                        therefore maintain the proposed 48,000 tons fish and fish
                                        products export weight, but are willing to guarantee that
                                        the export of “klipfisk” (i.e., salted dried fish) and
                                        “torfisk” (i.e., dried fish) shall not exceed 8,000 tons a
                                        year in all, and canned fish goods, if you so desire, shall
                                        not exceed 15,000 tons. It has not been the presupposition
                                        of the Norwegian Government that all export of fish oils <pb

                                        should be excluded, but they are willing to guarantee that

                                    corresp="frus1917Supp02v01#p_NF1">Nansen</persName>. My
                                impression is that peace rumors are responsible for this attitude to
                                a great extent. In the same way certain section of the press is
                                beginning to publish articles criticising our attitude in stopping
                                exports pending conclusion of negotiations as incompatible
                                principles of justice and unfair to Norway. This view is not held in
                                all quarters but seems to be becoming more common. As indicated in
                                previous reports to the Department such a development has seemed
                                very likely to take place but can not have a determining effect in
                                overcoming growing difficulties here due to increasing lack of food
                                and raw material. When the pressure becomes more severe and hopes of
                                early peace prove illusory a more reasonable attitude on the part of
                                Norway towards our proposals is sure to be assumed.</p>
                            <p>My British colleague intimated fearful of the consequences of early
                                resumption of export to the enemy which may begin as a result of
                                denunciation of British-Norwegian trade agreements and has urged
                                upon his Government expediency of setting a time limit for
                                acceptance by Norway of our proposal to <persName
                                    corresp="frus1917Supp02v01#p_NF1">Nansen</persName>. I concur in
                                the recommendation but not for the same reasons, as my opinion still
                                is that such resumption of export to the enemy would not be
                                tolerated for any length of time by people of this country and even
                                if it should be no relief of local shortage would result. I strongly
                                recommend however that a time limit be set for acceptance.</p>
                            <p>If at any time negotiations indicate probability of conclusion of an
                                agreement on the basis of War Trade Board’s proposal I venture to
                                suggest that the Department before final decision inform me of the
                                contemplated terms of such agreement in detail in order to afford
                                opportunity for suggestions made with knowledge of local conditions
                                here. Such final agreement must include safeguards concerning which
                                the Legation should be able to make pertinent observations. Embassy

                                had planned to go to Stockholm to thank King <persName

                                as a sign that Sweden had unreservedly accepted the secession of
                                Norway it would be well for him to go to Christiania. He was
                                received by the Norwegian people in the streets with sufficient
                                enthusiasm.</p>
                            <p>The <hi rend="italic">communiqué</hi> is a reflex as to what occurred
                                preliminary to the meeting of the Interparliamentary Conference
                                consisting of four members from each of the Scandinavian countries
                                to consider the question as to how Denmark, Norway and Sweden might
                                be more united politically and economically.</p>
                            <p>The suggestion that any belligerent power should seize a base in
                                Norway was not considered at either of the meetings. Irgens says
                                that Norway relies on the promise of the powers that its neutrality
                                shall not be broken. The three Scandinavian countries he said
                                emphatically would join in repelling such an aggression.</p>

                            <p>7956 [<hi rend="italic">7946</hi>]. A matter of first importance has
                                arisen in connection with the Swedish negotiations. The details of
                                the proposal as regards ore arranged by Doctor <persName
                                    corresp="frus1917Supp02v01#p_TAE1">Taylor</persName> before his
                                departure contemplated the retention in Sweden for her domestic
                                manufacture for all ore having less than .04 per cent phosphorus. In
                                view of <pb n="1085" xml:id="pg_1085" facs="0331"/>the great
                                importance to the German war industry of Swedish ore it is the
                                opinion of the Allies here that no efforts should be spared which
                                would make possible the utilization by them of a very considerable
                                portion of the ore with higher phosphorus content which previously
                                had been going to the enemy. The only method of reducing such
                                shipments to enemy appears to be the purchase and removal of a part
                                of the higher phosphorus ore and I am requested to ascertain with as
                                little delay as possible how much of such ore could be absorbed by
                                the United States.</p>
                            <p>The importance of this ore to Germany is represented to be such that
                                the cost or trouble of possible changes, if any, that might have to
                                be made in existing American furnace methods would be small as
                                compared with the benefits of depriving the enemy of this ore. The
                                French and English authorities are making similar inquiries, and as
                                the proceedings in the Swedish negotiations will be considerably
                                [affected by] the amount of this ore that the Allies can take, it is
                                of first importance that the information be furnished me at once.
                                Owing to peculiar local conditions the purchase and storage of ore
                                in Sweden is practically impossible in addition to its being unwise
                                to leave large stocks in Sweden as a temptation to enemy. If
                                proposed plan successful the output of the mines would be reasonably
                                restricted so that reduction of shipments to enemy will be
                                determined by amounts Allies can take. Please furnish copy War Trade

                                Only business transacted was that chairman, speaking for Allied
                                delegates, requested Swedes to submit memorandum of their desires
                                and of what they were willing to do in return. Another meeting will
                                be held to-morrow when Swedes are expected to present their
                                memorandum.</p>

                                last night informally told <persName
                                    corresp="frus1917Supp02v01#p_CLR1">Cecil</persName> that Sweden
                                was willing in principle to agree to our demands regarding reduction
                                of ore export to Germany and on the question of tonnage. But he
                                flatly stated that it would be impossible for Sweden to cease
                                exports of iron ore to Germany altogether and also that Sweden’s
                                most urgent needs were petroleum and <pb n="1086" xml:id="pg_1086"
                                    facs="0332"/>coal. Sweden has heretofore secured a great
                                majority of her coal from Germany and the fact that she is now
                                desirous of securing it from the Allies is taken as a favorable
                                indication. It is anticipated that the Swedes will offer objection
                                to the use of their tonnage in danger zones. It will be pointed out
                                to them that this is exactly where tonnage is needed but it is most
                                desirable to know just how far our Government desires American
                                delegates to press this point in negotiations. The question of ore
                                is dealt with in my telegram No. 7946, December 13, 4 p.m., and it
                                is urged that telegraphic instructions be sent me on both these
                                points earliest possible moment.</p>

                            <p>7977. Referring to my telegram 7952, December 13, 10 p.m. A further
                                meeting was held this afternoon to receive Swedish proposals which
                                were found to be of a general nature and it was therefore decided to
                                appoint sub-committees to deal respectively with rations and
                                imports, tonnage and iron ore.</p>
                            <p>These committees will begin work at once. Swedish delegates stated
                                they were under instructions before commencing negotiations to

                                and the discharge by our Government of about 25,000 tons of nitrates

                            <p>Your 7956 [<hi rend="italic">7946</hi>] regarding Swedish ore. War
                                Trade Board reports that there are no basic Bessemer or Thomas
                                process steel plants in this country and that by this process alone
                                can high <pb n="1087" xml:id="pg_1087" facs="0333"/>phosphorus ore
                                be used. All existing plants suited only to low phosphorus ores.
                                Under existing industrial conditions no plant would on private
                                account feel warranted in making changes necessary to use high
                                phosphorus ores. Only steel plants situated at or near seaboard
                                could use Swedish ore of any kind because railroad freights to
                                inland points would be prohibitive. These’ facts in connection with
                                present high ocean freights preclude bringing of high phosphorus
                                ores to this country for use in near future as a commercial
                                proposition. If these ores are to be purchased at all it must be on
                                Government account and for use at distant date. If Sweden will not
                                reduce export to Germany to point of crippling her the only result
                                of our Government purchasing would be to relieve Sweden of its
                                surplus ores.</p>

                                        accept^ the proposal of your Government in this respect and
                                        agrees to the exportation of 48,000 tons export weight of
                                        fish and fish products per annum to the Central powers. With
                                        respect to fish oil Norway is requesting considerable
                                        quantities of fats from the United States and its
                                        associates. While fish oil may not be an edible fat it is
                                        readily made edible and nutritious by admixture with certain
                                        other oils such as cotton-seed oil which Norway requests the
                                        United States and its associates to supply. Whatever oils
                                        Norway may export to the Central powers would be in
                                        diminution of Norway’s own supply of fats and our own
                                        exports of fats to Norway would to that extent be in
                                        substitution for fats exported to the Central powers. This
                                        board cannot consent to supply any commodities to Norway
                                        whether fats or other commodities which in effect will be
                                        substituted directly or indirectly for commodities exported
                                        to the Central powers. We assume that no fish or products of
                                        fish caught or in any way prepared with supplies imported
                                        from the United States or its associates are to be exported
                                        in any form to the Central powers and that the export of

                                        <hi rend="italic">Copper</hi>. The stipulations of this
                                        paragraph of your note do not seem to the board to be just.
                                        Your Government is asking for large quantities of copper
                                        from the United States and its associates. The exportable
                                        surplus of copper controlled by them is not sufficient to
                                        meet all demands. But so far as the war needs of the United
                                        States and its associates permit the board will assist in
                                        every way in supplying the copper needed by Norway. We agree
                                        to the export of copper to the Central powers in
                                        compensation for copper received from those powers in
                                        manufactured form plus 5 per cent to cover wastage. Your
                                        Government now claims the right to export compensation
                                        copper to the Central powers not in the form of crude or
                                        refined copper but in the form of the copper contents of
                                        ores which with exception of purple ore are lean in copper
                                        but rich in sulphur. The sulphur contents of these ores
                                        greatly exceed in value their copper contents. Sulphur is a
                                        commodity of prime importance in the manufacture of
                                        explosives and is of the greatest value as well to the
                                        United States and its associates as to the Central powers.
                                        The proposal of your Government would therefore result in
                                        granting to the Central powers under guise of compensation
                                        for copper a large amount of valuable war material which has
                                        nothing whatever to do with the principle of compensation.
                                        This board is unwilling to accept a proposal which has such
                                        results. No pyrites has in fact been exported by Norway to
                                        the Central powers for a considerable period of time. The
                                        compensation copper exported to the Central powers should be
                                        in the form of crude or refined copper as stipulated in our

                                        paragraphs of your note may well be treated as one. In them
                                        your Government reserves the right to export to the Central
                                        powers 15,000 tons of calcium carbide, 18,000 tons of
                                        calcium nitrate, 4,000 tons of ferro-silicon and 50 tons of
                                        molybdenite. The use of calcium carbide as an illuminant and
                                        of calcium nitrate as a fertilizer is more familiar to the
                                        public than the use of each of these commodities in the
                                        making of munitions. Each of the commodities covered by
                                        these two paragraphs is however not only usable but is
                                        largely used in the manufacture of munitions. Ferro-silicon
                                        and molybdenum are of course materials of the first
                                        importance in the manufacture of implements of war. In all
                                        of our communications with you in regard to Norway’s
                                        external trade we have sought only the free meeting of minds
                                        upon the question what would be fair concessions for the
                                        United States and her associates to expect from Norway in
                                        consideration of the large amount of commodities which
                                        Norway is asking from them. We cannot be wholly indifferent
                                        to the uses to which these commodities shall be applied.
                                        Your Government will not find it difficult to understand the
                                        grave reluctance of this board to the granting not only of
                                        large quantities of foodstuffs but of other commodities
                                        esssential to the maintenance of the industrial life of
                                        Norway in its full vigor only to see that vigor expended in

                                        reserves the right to export from Norway to the Central

                                        any limitation whatever as to kind or quantity. If we were
                                        to accept this paragraph as it stands we would be consenting
                                        to the export freely by your Government to the Central
                                        powers of many of the commodities which we are asked to
                                        furnish to Norway as well as all forms of nitrate of which
                                        Norway produces many besides calcium nitrate. Iron ore,
                                        iron, steel, zinc and aluminum would pass freely to the
                                        Central powers. This paragraph leaves the door wide open to
                                        unexpected developments which might easily cause deplorable
                                        misunderstandings and disagreements. The considerations
                                        stated above relating to the commodities described in
                                        paragraphs 4 and 3 of your note bear directly upon all
                                        commodities which are recognized as ingredients of munitions
                                        and supplies of war whether specifically mentioned by you or
                                        not and we submit to your Government that in consideration
                                        of the supplies to be furnished to Norway by the United
                                        States and its associates your Government should prevent the
                                        exportation of all commodities of that character to the
                                        Central powers. Your Government will of course agree that no
                                        commodity which the United States or its associates may
                                        furnish to Norway shall be exported to the Central powers or
                                        shall be used in the production of any other commodities
                                        which may be exported to the Central powers and that no
                                        commodity except fish and fish products upon which Norway
                                        has in the past placed restrictions of export by virtue of
                                        any agreement or understanding between herself and the
                                        British or French Governments before the entry of the United
                                        States into the war shall be exported to the Central powers.
                                        And in case Norway shall export to any neutral country
                                        contiguous to the Central powers, or either of them any
                                        commodity which Norway agrees not to export to the Central
                                        powers Norway will provide by agreement with the Government
                                        of such neutral country that no commodity so exported shall
                                        be re-exported directly or indirectly to the Central powers.

                                        estimated in advance. Your Government is aware that as to
                                        foodstuffs there is at the present time sufficient for all
                                        reasonable needs and that the main difficulty in the light
                                        of Germany’s piratical submarine activities lies in bringing
                                        supplies to the countries where they are needed. The United
                                        States and its associates control the larger part of the
                                        available supplies of such commodities and any agreement
                                        which may be reached with Norway will be entered into only
                                        with the concurrence of the associated powers. The board of
                                        course assumes that the Norwegian Government will consult
                                        with the United States and its associates as to the sources
                                        from which Norway shall from time to time obtain her

                                        And this board will expect the Norwegian Government to take
                                        prompt and effective steps to provide adequate organization
                                        to ensure that the agreement shall be properly carried out

                                the Swedish Parliament convenes on January 15 and unless the present

                                the record grade containing .2 to .4 per cent phosphorus, and all

                                <persName>Marcus Wallenberg</persName> stated he would telegraph
                                this proposal to his Government but that he could not recommend it
                                and was sure it would be immediately declined.
                                    <persName>Wallenberg</persName> states that a very large part of
                                the highest grade ore can be consumed in Sweden and that
                                considerable quantities will probably be exported to Denmark and
                                Norway next year. He has informally intimated to one of the American
                                representatives that he would be willing recommend to his Government
                                that all ore exports be equally divided between the Allies and
                                Germany. I should like to have early instructions on this point.
                                    <persName>Wallenberg</persName> points out that even this
                                arrangement would present serious difficulties for Sweden as she
                                would be obliged to decrease her exports to Germany who would
                                undoubtedly retaliate by curtailing exports to Sweden of coal and
                                other necessities.</p>
                            <p>Suggest that Doctor <persName>Lundbohm</persName> be consulted
                                regarding qualities of the various grades ore produced in Sweden as
                                he is thoroughly conversant with the subject.</p>

                                previously pointed out, would be most unfortunate.</p>

                                    >p.m.</hi>] Subcommittee on tonnage has proposed to Swedish
                                delegates that in addition to war risk at values already cabled your
                                charterers will be prepared to insure for further amount at rate of
                                4 per cent per month provided amount so insured shall in no case
                                exceed 75 per cent of the value of the ship. Swedish delegates
                                agreed to recommend this basis to their Government and to endeavor
                                at once to secure list of vessels whose owners are ready to sign
                                charters for period of three months subject to consent of Swedish
                                Government before charters take effect. Committee further agreed
                                that Inter-Allied Chartering Executive at London should sign these
                                charters as soon Swedish owners agreed and that allocation of
                                vessels so chartered should be the basis of a special agreement
                                between Associated Governments based on principles decided upon. At

                                translation of the official <hi rend="italic">communiqué</hi> of the
                                deliberations of the Scandinavian Kings and Prime and Foreign
                                Ministers in Christiania, which was handed to me by the Royal
                                Norwegian Minister for Foreign Affairs.</p>
                            <p>As stated in my telegrams referred to, it has been extremely
                                difficult to obtain any definite information regarding the actual
                                deliberations of the Royal conference which circumstance in itself
                                would appear to be significant. My Allied colleagues, who are as
                                anxious as I am to obtain information, have encountered similar
                                difficulties in regard to securing it.</p>
                            <p>While the <hi rend="italic">communiqué</hi> has all appearance of
                                being of considerable interest in as far as Scandinavian
                                co-operation and relations are concerned, its international
                                political import seems to be relatively small, the chief point of
                                interest in this respect being the declaration of the three
                                Governments to maintain their friendly relations, no matter what may
                                be the development or the duration of the war, There is no doubt
                                that King Gustaf’s initiative in bringing about this meeting has
                                strengthened the relations of the three countries; it is only
                                reasonable to presume, however, that he came here with a purpose. I
                                have been unable to ascertain the exact nature of any concrete
                                propositions put forward by His Majesty, but I am convinced that
                                notwithstanding the general impression that the Norwegian Government
                                (Liberal) is more willing to co-operate with the present Swedish
                                Liberal Government than with the former Conservative Cabinet, the
                                King of Sweden has found it more difficult than he anticipated to
                                secure the support of Norway in all matters.</p>
                            <p>I have also been unable to obtain any information regarding the
                                rumors, emanating from Copenhagen, that the main object of the <pb
                                    n="1097" xml:id="pg_1097" facs="0343"/>Danish King in coming to
                                Christiania was to induce the Norwegian Government to refrain from
                                entering into any agreements for the establishment of a naval base
                                in Norway by any foreign power, fearing that in such a contingency
                                Germany would immediately establish a base in Jutland off the Danish
                                coast.</p>
                            <p>As at all previous official meetings which have taken place in
                                Scandinavia since the outbreak of the war, resolutions were passed
                                to continue joint work for the preservation of neutrality, the
                                safeguarding of the interests of neutral nations within the limits
                                of their power, and the desirability of co-operation in
                                Scandinavia.</p>
                            <p>The decision to appoint immediately special representatives to draft
                                proposals having for their object an effort to develop the exchange
                                of inter-Scandinavian commodities is undoubtedly due to the existing
                                shortage of practically all commodities since the cessation of
                                imports from the United States and the uncertainty of the
                                Scandinavian countries as to the policy to be adopted by the United
                                States and the Allies. As I have repeatedly informed the Department,
                                an attempt may be made by these countries to manage with their own
                                resources rather than to discontinue all export to Germany. The
                                Minister for Foreign Affairs makes frantic endeavors to impress upon
                                me the possibility of their succeeding in such an attempt; the
                                Norwegian Government likewise is making desperate efforts to lead
                                the public to believe that such a scheme is feasible; but it seems
                                incredible that the Government itself can really imagine that an
                                effort in this direction could meet with any lasting success. I
                                asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, at a recent interview, what
                                commodities Norway could exchange with the other Scandinavian
                                countries; he replied, after meditating for some minutes, that she
                                could furnish them with fish, saltpetre for fertilizing purposes,
                                carbides, and raw copper. It is, of course, quite out of the
                                question that Norway, at any rate, could manage to exist for more
                                than a few months without foreign imports.</p>
                            <p>When calling on the Minister for Foreign Affairs yesterday, I
                                endeavored to obtain information in regard to the subjects which I
                                had previously been informed from a confidential and reliable source
                                would come up for discussion during the conference.</p>
                            <p>He denied that the questions of Finland and the Aland Islands were
                                officially discussed and declared that in any case they were purely
                                a Swedish affair and that, under no circumstances, could Norway
                                become a party to the furtherance of Swedish ambitions in connection
                                therewith (see my despatch No. 596 of November 30<note n="1"
                                    xml:id="d229fn3">Not printed.</note>). In diplomatic circles
                                here, however, it is felt that, even though <pb n="1098"
                                    xml:id="pg_1098" facs="0344"/>these questions may not have been
                                formally discussed at the conference, they must have formed the
                                subject of unofficial conversations.</p>
                            <p>In regard to the attitude of the three countries towards peace
                                proposals, Mr. <persName corresp="frus1917Supp02v01#p_INC1"
                                    >Ihlen</persName> stated that no action had been taken and that
                                he considered it inexpedient to discuss the question. He also
                                informed me that nothing had been done in regard to the calling of a
                                conference of neutral nations.</p>
                            <p>Undoubtedly one of the principal topics which came up for discussion
                                at the conference was the question of the Scandinavian attitude in
                                regard to Allied pressure concerning the export and import
                                situation. I have been informed from several reliable resources that
                                it was mutually agreed that a complete cessation of Scandinavian
                                exports to the enemy would be impossible and that if an attempt
                                should be made to bring pressure to bear on any of the three
                                countries in order to enforce such cessation it would be jointly
                                resisted. However, the information of my British colleague on this
                                point differs from the information which I have received; he has
                                been led to believe that it was resolved that if any of the
                                Scandinavian countries concluded agreements to discontinue exports
                                to any of the belligerents, it would not be considered an unneutral
                                act by either of the Scandinavian neighbors. I will investigate this
                                point very carefully and should I find that the British Minister’s
                                information is correct I will immediately telegraph to the
                                Department to that effect.</p>
                            <p>I endeavored to sound Mr. <persName
                                    corresp="frus1917Supp02v01#p_INC1">Ihlen</persName> as to
                                whether the question of an alliance had been brought up; he replied
                                in the negative stating that the deliberations of the conference had
                                been confined to informal accords having in view the furtherance of
                                Scandinavian cooperation and amicable relations.</p>
                            <p>As a matter of fact, given the peculiar situation and the physical
                                conditions of each Scandinavian country, an alliance tending to
                                restrict their individual liberty of action and right of
                                independence in commercial and foreign political relations would
                                seem to be inexpedient at these critical times. On the contrary, I
                                gather from information which I have sought regarding this subject
                                that, in the opinion of the thinking members of the community,
                                solidarity in the North should only imply amity and co-operation in
                                inter-Scandinavian matters for the furtherance of their mutual
                                interests and the preservation of a joint neutrality if
                                possible.</p>
                            <p>As stated in the <hi rend="italic">communiqué</hi>, the Minister for
                                Foreign Affairs confirmed that representatives will be appointed to
                                discuss economic and political problems both during and after the
                                war.</p>
                            <p>It was also agreed that closer co-operation is necessary to combat
                                against the Scandinavian countries being overrun by spies and that
                                    <pb n="1099" xml:id="pg_1099" facs="0345"/>adequate measures
                                should be adopted in order to render police activities in this
                                respect more effective. It is possibly with this in mind that the
                                question of the amendment of the laws pertaining to aliens came up
                                for consideration.</p>
                            <p>The belligerent diplomats were not invited to assist at any of the
                                functions during the Royal visit, with the exception of the German
                                Secretary, <persName>Prince Wied</persName>, and his wife who were
                                present at a reception given for the King of Sweden at the Swedish

                                <p>During the visit of the Kings in Christiania, from the 28th to
                                    30th November, 1917, deliberations took place between the three
                                    Kings, the Norwegian Prime Minister, the Danish Prime Minister,
                                    the Swedish Prime Minister, and the Foreign Ministers of the
                                    three countries.</p>

                                        >Haakon</persName> opened the meeting with the following
                                    speech: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                        <p>It is a great joy for me and the Norwegian people to see
                                            Your Majesties with us to-day, and with Your Majesties
                                            the two countries’ Prime and Foreign Ministers, thus
                                            affording an opportunity, at a personal meeting, to
                                            discuss important questions for the three countries.</p>
                                        <p>I will first of all utilize this occasion to express to
                                            the King of Sweden the gratefulness which Norway feels
                                            towards Your Majesty for having personally taken the
                                            initiative to bring about our meeting at Malmo and
                                            thereby having facilitated the invaluable co-operation
                                            between the three countries during the war. To this is
                                            now added the deep satisfaction at Your Majesty having
                                            come personally to Christiania in order to give us a
                                            definite proof that that which formerly divided us no
                                            longer casts any shadows over unity in Scandinavia.</p>
                                        <p>This meeting at Christiania will confirm to the whole
                                            world that the desire of the three Scandinavian
                                            countries to preserve neutrality, in future as
                                            heretofore, will remain firm and unshaken and that their
                                            protection of joint interests is continually in
                                            progress.</p>
                                        <p>Once the unfortunate World War shall have ended and each
                                            of the three countries, thanks to their union and
                                            co-operation, stands saved and free, the war will in any
                                            case have borne one good fruit for the North by having
                                            further developed the feelings of fraternity.</p>
                                        <p>With this purpose in view, I am convinced that the
                                            deliberations which we are about to proceed to to-day
                                            will lead to the goal in view.</p>

                                    he had again set his foot upon Norwegian soil and expressed his
                                    thanks for the courtesy which had rendered it possible for him
                                    to visit the King of Norway. Finally, His Majesty expressed his
                                    best wishes for the success of the deliberations of the
                                    conference together with the hope that the co-operation which
                                    had been commenced in Malmo and had since been continued would
                                    lead to a good and successful result for the three Scandinavian
                                    peoples.</p>
                                <p>During the meeting unanimity was confirmed in regard to the
                                    following: On the basis of the solidarity of the three
                                    countries, the Governments have agreed to declare that whatever
                                    may be the duration of the World War and whatever may be its
                                    further development the friendly and intimate relations between
                                    the three Kingdoms will be maintained.</p>
                                <p>In accordance with former declarations and the policy they have
                                    pursued hitherto, it is the firm intention of each of the three
                                    Kingdoms to do their utmost to maintain neutrality towards all
                                    of the belligerent powers.</p>
                                <p>Mutual expression was given to the desirability of each country
                                    helping the other with supplies of necessary commodities to an
                                    increased degree during the existing difficulties. In order to
                                    further a more effective exchange of commodities between the
                                    three countries than hitherto, it was agreed that immediately
                                    after the meeting special representatives should meet in order
                                    to draft the requisite proposal to this end.</p>
                                <p>The question was discussed of the possibility of amending the
                                    laws pertaining to aliens in the three countries as well as
                                    those relating to the subjects of the other two countries.</p>
                                <p>It was agreed to continue the preparatory work for the protection
                                    of the joint interests of neutral states both during and after
                                    the war.</p>
                                <p>As at previous meetings, renewed expression was given to the
                                    desirability of the co-operation between the three countries
                                    being continued.</p>

                                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Sir</hi>: Supplementary to our talk of
                                    to-day, this is to propose to you that the War Trade Board
                                    desires, as an evidence of the good will of the American people
                                    towards the Danish people, that we shall allow certain
                                    shipments, which shall be of benefit to the Danish people as a
                                    whole, to go forward promptly. This is done at this particular
                                    season of the year as an expression of Christmas good
                                    wishes.</p>
                                <p>We are prepared to license some thousands of tons of kerosene and
                                    of coffee on such ships as you may designate, say two cargoes,
                                    and only ask in return that you charter to us, at the present
                                    current market prices, an equivalent amount of tonnage for
                                    either two West Indian round or one South American round trip,
                                    which is estimated to occupy about the same time as the Danish
                                    vessels going to Denmark would take for the round trip.</p>
                                <p>We realize in selecting the above commodities that the nights are
                                    long in Denmark at this period of the year, and that kerosene
                                    may, therefore, be more broadly appreciated by and useful to
                                    your people than some other commodity which might be selected.
                                    We also know your national characteristic of coffee
                                    drinking.</p>
                                <p>We shall be glad to have you express this proposal to your
                                    Government by cable, and to have you indicate, if you are in
                                    accord with the proposal, as we understand you to be, which
                                    vessels would be more suitable for the purposes outlined.</p>
                                <p>With highest assurances of my regard [etc.]</p>

                                </hi>: The Foreign Office have now sent us a reply regarding the
                                question of the proposed Christmas gifts to Norway, Sweden and
                                Denmark. They state that in deference to your views they are willing
                                to agree to the principle of the despatch of these shipments. They
                                suggest, however, that the Norwegian ships to be chartered in return
                                for Christmas concession should, if possible, be taken from class 5
                                and employed in trades of importance to the conduct of the war. They
                                presume that, in any case, the ships carrying these cargoes will
                                give a guarantee to return to a United States port.</p>

                                    <p>The Danish Government also regret that the negotiations which
                                        have lately been conducted in Washington, D. C, have not
                                        reached a conclusion but note with satisfaction that your
                                        Government are animated with the desire of pushing forward
                                        the negotiations in every way possible and that the proposal
                                        which you have put forward as a basis of the negotiations is
                                        open to modifications.</p>

                                    <p>In conformity herewith I have the honor to set forth below a
                                        counter-proposal on the part of the Danish Government asking
                                        you to be good enough to bring the contents of this note to
                                        the knowledge of your Goverment and to request them to hand

                                    <p>It seems to me that the proposal of the United States
                                        Government can suitably be divided into three principal

                                        again been refused by the War Trade Board.</p>
                                    <p>The following alterations in the list are, however, desired:
                                        copper raised to 2,500 tons; coffee raised to 16,000 tons;
                                        cocoanuts raised to 100 tons; tea raised to 600 tons; spices
                                        raised to 500 tons; pepper raised to 168 tons; rubber goods,
                                        rubber shoes and rubber tires, 700 tons. It is desired that
                                        the ration for wood, 300 tons, should be abolished and the
                                        materials given us in accordance with our needs.</p>
                                    <p>The Danish associations do not wish to protract the
                                        negotiations by further demands for goods but would
                                        stipulate that negotiations respecting such goods as well as
                                        respecting the rations fixed may always be possible. The
                                        associations also desire that the goods already bought be
                                        liberated even if they in all surpass the rations fixed and
                                        even if not on list. It is desired that the rations be
                                        equally divided over the year and that it is assured that
                                        season articles arrive on time.</p>

                                        further think that the arrangement should only comprise
                                        goods originating in America, but from the fact that the
                                        American Government have entered on this list goods which do
                                        not originate in America, the Danish Government draw with
                                        pleasure the conclusion that imports to Denmark which come
                                        under the control of the naval forces of the United States
                                        or loaded on ships supplied with American coals or oil
                                        deposited abroad will not be interfered with. As regards
                                        particularly Chile saltpetre on the adequate and timely
                                        arrival of which raw material the whole supply of Denmark
                                        with cereals for next winter depends, the idea that any
                                        stoppage could be thought of in connection with this import
                                        can only cause the greatest anxiety to the Danish
                                        Government.</p>

                                        <hi rend="italic">Subdivision 3</hi>. As regards the
                                        stipulations and conditions for the employ of the goods
                                        received from America the Danish Government suggest that the
                                        guarantee system established by the “Grosserer-Societet” and
                                        the “Industriraad” be accepted as satisfactory. In this
                                        connection I hereby state that the Danish Government are
                                        convinced that these two institutions to the best of their
                                        efforts will fulfil the obligations upon which they enter as
                                        has been clearly manifested by the work of the associations
                                        during the last two years. For this reason the stipulation
                                        that the exports of manufactured articles from Denmark must
                                        not exceed $2,000 becomes superfluous. The Danish Government
                                        have, however, no objections to accept the special
                                        conditions respecting the use of lubricants, kerosene, and
                                        gasoline.</p>

                                        <hi rend="italic">Group 2, subdivision 1</hi>. The Danish
                                        Government exceedingly regret the position which the
                                        American Government have taken respecting the export of
                                        Danish agricultural produce and which, according to the
                                        reports received from our Legation in Washington, does not
                                        coincide with the position previously taken by the American
                                        representatives during the negotiations. As I have
                                        repeatedly had the honor to state to your Government,
                                        through the American Minister here and through the King’s
                                        Minister at Washington, the large export of butter, bacon,
                                        and eggs to England during the war could only be maintained
                                        as long as the import of fodder-stuff to Denmark was free. A
                                        change in the existing distribution is therefore only
                                        possible should the policy of the United States and Great
                                        Britain and her allies be altered so as to allow the free
                                        import of fodder-stuffs, but in any case it would not be
                                        possible to revert to the pre-war percentages, but only to
                                        38 per cent for butter and about 18 per cent for bacon to
                                        Germany, the distribution existing until the stoppage of the
                                        fodder-stuff imports occurred.</p>
                                    <p>I beg also to state that though the Danish Government had
                                        declared to the British Government that the consequence of
                                        the stoppage of the fodder-stuff import would be that
                                        largely increased exports would go to Germany, the Danish
                                        Government have succeeded in carrying through that only
                                        about 50 per cent of the total exports of butter, bacon and
                                        eggs actually go to Germany after the home market together
                                        with Scandinavian markets have been supplied. This solution
                                        of the situation has been accepted by the British
                                        Government. Sweden and Norway receive now about 30 per cent
                                        of the exportable surplus and Germany actually gets only 35
                                        per cent of bacon and butter, thus for the last-mentioned
                                        article somewhat less than before the stoppage of the
                                        fodder-stuff import. In order, however, not to leave any
                                        attempt untried to reach an agreement, the Danish Government
                                        are willing for a period of six months to guarantee that the
                                        export of bacon and butter to Germany will not go beyond 800
                                        tons a week. This can only be considered an average amount,
                                        a certain option being reserved for a period of at least two
                                        months’ duration.</p>

                                        <hi rend="italic">Group 3, subdivision 1</hi>. The demand of
                                        the American Government for the cession of tonnage in return
                                        for licenses for export, especially for an amount of tonnage
                                        of such dimensions, involves difficulties of a political
                                        nature, both external and internal, as well as of an
                                        economic nature.</p>
                                    <p>At this period of the war when from German side every effort
                                        is made to destroy as much tonnage as possible, in order to
                                        prevent the supplies reaching its opponents, a further
                                        cession of tonnage practically comprising the remaining
                                        surplus of the Danish Fleet will be viewed with the greatest
                                        dissatisfaction and suspicion. The Danish Government
                                        therefore feel compelled to object to sanctioning the
                                        cession of such tonnage as such action on their part may
                                        entail grave political consequences for Denmark in her
                                        relations with her southerly neighbor. Should it
                                        nevertheless be necessary to cede tonnage, the Danish
                                        Government must likewise even more strenuously object to the
                                        employ of such tonnage, wholly or partly, in the danger
                                        zone.</p>
                                    <p>But also for internal political reasons the question is most
                                        difficult to solve. When Danish shipping ceded 200,000 tons
                                        to England in June, 1917, it was done on the understanding
                                        that no further demands for duty voyage or other tonnage
                                        would be put forward so that the remainder of Danish
                                        shipping could be employed without danger in bringing the
                                        supplies of which the country was in need. As the question
                                        now stands, it amounts to a demand on the shipping community
                                        of Denmark to give up the entire control of their Fleet to
                                        be used at the will of another country. In the United
                                        States, where commercial, industrial, and shipping
                                        communities have the fullest freedom to arrange their
                                        affairs, as they think it best, I believe it will be easily
                                        understood with what feelings the demand of the American
                                        Government has been received by the entire Danish shipping
                                        world. A cession of this kind would necessarily have to be
                                        voluntary, for it stands to reason that it is difficult, not
                                        to say impossible, to pass laws whereby Danish citizens
                                        would be compelled to cede the use of their property to a
                                        belligerent country.</p>
                                    <p>Apart from the political considerations, it will be
                                        understood that every shipowner strenuously objects to
                                        allowing his ships to sail in the danger zone. A Danish
                                        company can reasonably be expected to expose the lives of
                                        the crew intrusted to his care and his ships in order to
                                        bring supplies through the danger zone to Denmark, but not
                                        from one belligerent country to another. The anxieties and
                                            <pb n="1106" xml:id="pg_1106" facs="0352"/>unwillingness
                                        of Danish shipowners to enter upon an arrangement is further
                                        increased by the fact that lately the British Government
                                        have put forward a claim to have the 200,000 tons ceded to
                                        them in June, 1917, maintained to the full amount, so that
                                        Danish shipping shall not only bear the losses suffered in
                                        Allied trade, but even expose more ships to the same danger.
                                        They naturally think there is a limit to the demand which
                                        can be made on them, however much, they wish to ease the
                                        political situation of their native country. The amount of
                                        tonnage claimed by the British Government is 35,000 tons
                                        which will materially alter the basis on which the American
                                        calculations are made.</p>
                                    <p>The difficulties of economic nature are manifold, but it will
                                        only be necessary to point out that not only does the
                                        tonnage lost constitute a great danger for the economic
                                        development of the companies themselves, it being impossible
                                        within reasonable time to replace the ships, but the loss of
                                        tonnage is a danger to Denmark’s whole economic life, as
                                        after the war this country risks to stand denuded of ships
                                        wherewith to bring home the necessary raw materials for the
                                        rebuilding of her agriculture which is now and perhaps for
                                        many years to come, crippled.</p>
                                    <p>The Danish Government wishing to come to an agreement with
                                        the United States, are still negotiating with the shipping
                                        companies. This is the reason why this answer has been
                                        delayed and why the following counter-proposals can only be
                                        termed the tentative position of Danish shipping to the
                                        general question of the cession of tonnage.</p>
                                    <p>[<hi rend="italic">Subdivision 2</hi>.] In order to bring to
                                        Denmark coals from England and oversea supplies 450,000 tons
                                        of tonnage will be necessary. As regards the employ of the
                                        tonnage left for Denmark, no conditions as to its use can be
                                        accepted. The Danish Government must in principle insist
                                        that whatever tonnage is ceded, the supply of tonnage at
                                        Denmark’s disposal ought always be kept up to the quantity
                                        necessary for Denmark’s supplies.</p>

                                        cession of tonnage, no further claims can therefore be put
                                        forward either by the United States Government or by their

                                        Danish shipping desire that freights as well as indemnities

                                    <p>For political reasons the Danish Government finally think it

                                        concluded between the commercial, industrial and shipping
                                        associations and the American Government, but the King’s
                                        Minister at Washington has been fully authorized to
                                        negotiate with the American Government respecting the

                                intractable spirit than could have been expected before the recent
                                successes of the Central powers. Aside from the generally
                                unsatisfactory tone of the note, indications of German inspiration
                                appear in almost every paragraph. It would seem hardly possible that
                                many of their counter-proposals which are clearly impossible of
                                acceptance could have been made seriously. The proposal of maximum
                                terms for bargaining purposes such as the demand for the liberation
                                of all goods already purchased, the protraction of the negotiations
                                in anticipation of an early peace, or at German instigation, in the
                                hope of obtaining in the meantime the return to Denmark of a
                                considerable portion of their tonnage, may all have exercised their
                                influence in the formulation of the Danish demands.</p>
                            <p>In group 1, subdivision 2, the assumption that goods imported in
                                ships supplied with American coal or oil, preferably coal or oil of
                                Allied origin, would not be interfered with might apparently be met
                                by a provision that the amounts should not exceed the total ration
                                proposed while not losing sight of the possible interpretation of
                                “interfered with “to guarantee exemption from inspection or
                                detention.</p>
                            <p>[Subdivision] 3: An endeavor is evidently made to interpret our
                                demand that manufactured products not to exceed $2,000 in value
                                should be exported to the Central Empires in any one month as
                                applying to goods of American origin alone. No mention is made of
                                oils with reference to use. It is suggested that the stipulations be
                                made to include all petroleum and petroleum products of other than
                                enemy origin.</p>
                            <p>Group 2, subdivision 1: Owing to the steadily decreasing [production,
                                continued allowance] of 50 per cent of the surplus bacon and butter
                                to Germany after the Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish markets have
                                been fully supplied would seem preferable to the proposed 800 tons
                                weekly. The introduction of cumulative provisions and the deliberate
                                vagueness found in this and the following proposals <pb n="1109"
                                    xml:id="pg_1109" facs="0355"/>unmistakably show the hand of
                                Germany endeavoring to insure increased imports during the months of
                                her greatest need. It is recommended that the proposed increase in
                                the number of cattle and horses to be exported be disallowed and
                                that no tanning materials be licensed so long as hides are exported
                                to Germany.</p>
                            <p>Subdivision 2: Advantage is taken of the difference in terminology to
                                put forward the presumption that petroleum of American origin may be
                                used for fishing boats now almost exclusively operated in the German
                                [interest].</p>
                            <p>Group 3, subdivision 1: I have reason to believe, aside from the
                                implication in the note, that the Danish Government have been warned
                                that Germany would consider the placing of any tonnage at the
                                disposal of an enemy of the latter as bordering on a breach of
                                neutrality from which they endeavor to extricate themselves by
                                declaring that any “cession of this kind would have to be voluntary”
                                on the part of the shipowners.</p>
                            <p>Subdivision 2: The claim for the need of 450,000 [tons] of shipping
                                for Danish domestic needs is based presumably on the 150,000 tons of
                                coal monthly for which Great Britain has promised to issue licenses
                                and the full complement of rations demanded. Germany has recently
                                agreed to supply Denmark with 400,000 tons of coal distributed over
                                four months and the British import has averaged 68,000 monthly since
                                September last. In a recent letter one of the principal Danish
                                financiers, especially well informed in this regard, states that by
                                strict economy and the use of peat and wood “the Danish coal
                                consumption may be reduced to about 200,000 tons per month.” Thus
                                with the German contract fulfilled but 100,000 tons monthly would be
                                needed from England which by speeding up the voyages could
                                presumably be carried by 100,000 tons of shipping. The failure to
                                impose conditions as to the employment of tonnage allotted for
                                Danish use would make possible not only the accumulation and tying
                                up of shipping in Danish ports but also its immediate availability
                                for German service on the advent of peace. The contention that
                                Denmark should always have at her disposal ships enough to meet her
                                needs is in principle reasonable but an exaggeration of those needs
                                may always be counted on.</p>
                            <p>Subdivision 6: By guaranteeing full bunkers out and back to Denmark
                                we would surrender one of our most effective means of control. The
                                delivery of stores and provisions in conformity with the wishes of
                                the owners could hardly have been made seriously.</p>
                            <p>Subdivision 8: If on the plea of efficiency inspection harbors are to
                                be avoided vessels sailing from a South American neutral port to
                                Denmark would be immune from any but inspection at sea. The
                                fortnight’s notice for termination would seem acceptable provided it
                                applied even only to notice given by the United States
                                Government.</p>
                            <pb n="1110" xml:id="pg_1110" facs="0356"/>
                            <p>Should it not be found possible to reach some grounds I should
                                venture to suggest that the Danish tonnage now in our control might
                                be made utilizable through bunker contracts and such vessels as
                                might persist in lying idle forced into traffic through special
                                harbor dues. The Danish Government would thus be relieved of their
                                embarrassment <hi rend="italic">vis à vis</hi> the Germans and the
                                latter would not be able to avail themselves valuable propaganda
                                material which would attend requisitioning. In order to prevent an
                                accumulation of shipping in Danish ports and its probable detention
                                in response to German pressure the suggestion is ventured that no
                                Danish ship be permitted to sail from a United States port for
                                Denmark until one of equal tonnage bound from Denmark to United
                                States had passed west of the line of blockade.</p>

                                discussed. According to information which I consider reliable but
                                which I give under reservation, opposition to acceptance of our
                                proposal was led by Minister for Foreign Affairs and by President of
                                Storthing. Konow, supported by two other members of the committee,
                                strongly urged acceptance denouncing dilatory tactics of the
                                Government, which would inevitably lead this country into a most
                                distressing situation in a relatively short time. After long
                                discussion, and against minority opinion, it was decided to make a
                                counter-proposal to our offer of December 20 on the following
                                conditions: Norway to limit fish export to Germany to 4,000 tons
                                monthly pending continuation of negotiations, other exports to
                                Germany to continue as heretofore; foregoing against immediate
                                American license for export to Norway of 10,000 tons grain, 5,000
                                tons oil, and 5,000 tons phosphates.</p>

                                    >Nansen</persName> has telegraphed Minister for Foreign Affairs
                                that our proposal of December 20 was stated by <persName

                                qualified his statement by saying that if our terms entailed <pb

                                becoming involved in war, they might be mitigated to some extent. If
                                the last statement was actually made, I venture to point out that it
                                is likely to have a most regrettable effect, and will tend to
                                increase difficulty of obtaining agreement.</p>
                            <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="frus1917Supp02v01#p_KG1"
                                    >Knudsen</persName> recently stated in a private conversation
                                that our terms would not be acceptable, in any case until spring,
                                when conditions might be such as to make it indispensable to accept
                                them. This provides index of present attitude here which has been
                                considerably modified in the course of past two months, as the
                                result of Russo-German situation. Certain [as] it may be that
                                shortage of essential foodstuffs and raw materials will make itself
                                felt with increasing severity from now on, the moral atmosphere has
                                changed and the present feeling in Government circles seems to be
                                one of expectancy.</p>
                            <p>Summing up I see no reason whatever at the present time for altering
                                or in any way qualifying our last proposal in its general
                                principles. London informed.</p>

                            <p>A copy of the latest counter-proposals of the War Trade Board was
                                submitted to the Foreign Office for comment and the reply has just
                                been received from <persName corresp="frus1917Supp02v01#p_CLR1">Lord

                                    <p>I have studied the text of the letter carefully and am happy
                                        to be able to inform you that I consider its terms generally
                                        satisfactory and that they represent in a general way the
                                        lines of policy which His Majesty’s Government would be
                                        prepared to adopt in the final agreement to be concluded
                                        with the Norwegian Government.</p>
                                    <p>The only points on which I have any serious observations to
                                        offer are the following: <list>
                                            <label>1.</label>
                                            <item>The stipulation in paragraph 2 that no pyrites
                                                should be allowed to go to Central powers in
                                                exchange for copper is satisfactory so far as it
                                                goes but in view of large Norwegian production and
                                                Germany’s urgent need we should have preferred
                                                absolute prohibition of export of pyrites to
                                                enemy.</item>
                                            <label>2.</label>
                                            <item>The prior option asked for in paragraphs 3 and 4
                                                on calcium carbide, calcium nitrate, ferro-silicon
                                                and molybdenite will be an effective safeguard only
                                                if United States and the Allies are prepared to buy
                                                up to prevent production. Moreover it is not quite
                                                clear whether prior option is intended to absolve
                                                Norwegians from their previous undertaking to
                                                restrict exports to enemy to fixed figures or
                                                whether they are now free to export any quantity or
                                                (on?) which we do not elect to exercise our rights
                                                of prior option. In latter case there is danger of
                                                Allies having to buy more than they require and the
                                                absence of any stipulation as to a reasonable price
                                                may make it possible for Germans to run up prices
                                                against them. This is especially true in case of
                                                molybdenite and we should have preferred absolute
                                                prohibition of exports of this material.</item>

                                                and supplies of war.” We note that it is hoped that
                                                the Norwegian Government will see reasonableness of
                                                prohibiting export to our enemies of all materials

                                Government our answers are as follows:</p>
                            <p>No. 1. Regret we can not agree to allow Swedish shipowners to charter
                                their vessels to Belgian Relief Committee without usual conditions
                                of return as we desire as a part of this agreement to see all
                                Swedish tonnage moving because on any other basis we can not let the
                                necessary commodities go forward to Sweden. We appreciate
                                disposition of Swedish representatives to get all tonnage moving and
                                they may rest assured that we will give every possible co-operation
                                in this direction.</p>
                            <p>No. 2. Sweden to agree to charter to Inter-Allied Chartering
                                Executive and to the United States Shipping Board on a 50-50 basis
                                the Swedish ships now idle in Allied or European ports for use in
                                war zone for a period of three months.</p>
                            <p>Rates in safe trades to be those of the American Chartering Committee
                                which are 35 shillings for West Indies or east coast of South
                                America and 40 shillings for west coast South America. Rates on
                                vessels travelling to war zone to be same as those shown in your
                                cable December 22, which are identical with those being paid under
                                Norwegian agreement with Great Britain.</p>
                            <p>No. 3. We agree to values on insurance against war risks as proposed
                                covering steamers under 10 years old, basis 40 pounds per deadweight

                                the Government having vessel under charter, and will be against loss
                                by war risks only. We can not agree that all Swedish charters will
                                be signed by Inter-Allied Chartering Executive in London but whole
                                matter must be on basis of charters to Shipping Board and to Great
                                Britain 50 per cent to each after allowing for Sweden’s necessary
                                trades above outlined. Reallocation of tonnage <pb n="1115"
                                    xml:id="pg_1115" facs="0361"/>to our allies will be arranged
                                after mutual conferences, but until broader plan worked out this
                                basis must be carried out. Will authorize you or representative
                                Shipping Board later named to sign charters.</p>
                            <p>No. 4. Present Swedish vessels chartered to Belgian Relief to
                                continue to be chartered to them. The Swedish ships now engaged in
                                trades of interest to Allies are to be placed in necessary trades to
                                be mutually arranged between England and United States and to be
                                chartered half to United States and half to Great Britain, at rates
                                above mentioned.</p>
                            <p>No. 5. Swedish Government to have for its own trade vessels needed to
                                run between Sweden and Great Britain and also to United States,
                                estimated to be about 250,000 tons. All the balance of the tonnage
                                is to be chartered to the United States and Great Britain, 50 per
                                cent to each with proper provisions as to Belgian Relief, war zone
                                trade and outside trade, at present employed. We desire if possible
                                to follow the basis proposed between Denmark and United States which
                                was about one-third safe trades and two-thirds in the war zone with
                                our option of using some of these in the Belgian Relief. These boats
                                must be definitely chartered for three months if war zone, or if
                                safe trades four months’ basis in accordance with the above
                                clauses.</p>
                            <p>The United States will agree to arrange examination outside danger
                                zone and to give sufficient bunker coals. It must be understood that
                                the usual conditions of return shall be agreed to by Sweden, but
                                that this condition will not be made onerous in view of the basis of
                                vessels being chartered to respective governments.</p>
                            <p>Last paragraph of this cable. We will be agreeable to giving some
                                feed concentrates if it can be spared from this country under
                                understanding on tonnage agreement along lines of agreement and
                                arrangement concluded.</p>

                                relieve the coal situation and thereafter will make voyages to the
                                west coast of South America bringing back nitrates.</p>
                            <p>
                                <hi rend="italic">Sweden</hi>. The arrangement is that we license
                                5,500 tons of kerosene and 2,500 tons coffee which are to go forward
                                on the steamships <hi rend="italic">Stockholm</hi> and <hi

                                and the <hi rend="italic">Göthland</hi> is to go to the east or west
                                coast of South America, in the option of the Shipping Board.</p>
                            <p>
                                <hi rend="italic">Norway</hi>. This country has been slower in
                                working out the Christmas idea but they have accepted it in
                                principle and are going to name their boats very shortly. Cables
                                seem to have been slower in being passed between Doctor <persName

                            <p>The feeling created has been very good and it is interesting for you
                                to know that since the British approved the Christmas idea on the
                                24th of December they have come around to the belief that a larger
                                amount of all commodities should be licensed to the different
                                countries as a matter of keeping good feeling and preventing German
                                propaganda having too much influence.</p>
                            <p>The Dutch arrangement will also soon be completed and I will be glad
                                to give you further memoranda when it has been finished.</p>
                            <p>The feeling of each country is expressed in a paragraph that I quote
                                from the letters [of their representatives] as follows: <quote

                                        have noticed how deeply this generous offer and Christmas

                                        Government as a matter of fact immediately cabled me the
                                        instruction to express to you their sincere sense of

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inform you that a
                            great deal of anxiety has been expressed in the Dutch press on account
                            of the publication of articles reaching this country through Reuter’s
                            Agency, to the effect that the American Government intended to stop
                            shipments of foodstuffs to countries in close communication with
                            Germany.</p>
                        <p>In connection with these reports, the Foreign Office issued the following
                                <hi rend="italic">communiqué</hi> to the press: <quote

                                <p>In consequence of the proposals introduced into Congress to
                                    discuss the limitation of exports from the United States,
                                    particularly of foodstuffs and metal, the Dutch Minister at
                                    Washington was instructed to obtain the feelings of the
                                    Government on the subject. The Minister has had an interview
                                    with the President of the United States and explained to him the
                                    situation, together with what the consequences would be to
                                    Holland of an eventual prohibition of exports especially of food
                                    and metal.</p>
                                <p>Mr. <persName corresp="frus1917Supp02v01#p_WW1">Wilson</persName>
                                    pointed out that the proposals as introduced did not involve
                                    prohibition of export but simply gave him the power to issue
                                    such a prohibition if necessary.</p>
                                <p>The President added that only in the case of utter necessity,
                                    which at present he did not foresee, should he be brought to
                                    forbid the export of foodstuffs and metal to Holland, for he was
                                    aware of the position in which this country was placed in regard
                                    to the belligerents.</p>
                                <p>The President took the opportunity of assuring our Minister of
                                    his great sympathy for our country.</p>

                            Germany. He stated that he has been approached by members of the

                            Government of the United States but that he invariably replied that he

                            assurances given to the Dutch Minister at Washington by the President in

                            full notes on the position with regard to the various neutral European
                            countries in connection with the possible prohibition by the United
                            States Government of various exports to those countries. In the notes on
                            Holland it was explained that smuggling of Dutch and overseas produce to
                            Germany had assumed very serious proportions, but no suggestion was made
                            as to the method of dealing with this situation.</p>
                        <p>I am now instructed to make the following suggestion to you which I
                            should be glad if you would regard as an addition to those made in the
                            note on Holland in this memorandum. According to all the reports which
                            reach His Majesty’s Government considerable quantities of foodstuffs are
                            crossing the frontier from Holland into Germany in addition to the
                            authorised exports. The Netherlands Government have in the past been
                            inclined to reply to all protests on this subject that the question of
                            smuggling was solely a domestic Dutch question, but it is suggested that
                            the United States Government might, in the present situation, insist
                            that the Netherlands Government should provide the necessary means to
                            prevent smuggling in future since otherwise there can be no certainty
                            that foodstuffs or other goods imported from the United States will not
                            pass directly into the hands of the enemy.</p>
                        <pb n="1119" xml:id="pg_1119" facs="0365"/>
                        <p>I should like to take this opportunity of communicating to you one
                            further general suggestion which Mr. <persName
                                corresp="frus1917Supp02v01#p_BAJ1">Balfour</persName> wishes to make
                            as an addition to the memorandum. The United States Government will
                            doubtless realise that American exports of mineral oil to the various
                            neutral European countries can be and are used directly to facilitate
                            the supply of goods to the enemy. This is a somewhat complicated
                            question, but if the United States Government were prepared to ask for
                            undertakings from importers in such countries of oil from the United
                            States that that oil should not in any way be used, as fuel or
                            otherwise, for the manufacture or transport of products destined for the
                            enemy, His Majesty’s Government would be glad to consult with them as to
                            the directions in which and the methods by which such undertakings could
                            most usefully be obtained.</p>

                        <p>The British Government has been in negotiation with the Netherlands
                            Government on various trade matters, including shipping. Pending a
                            favourable reply from the Netherlands Government to the proposals made
                            to a Dutch representative in London, the British Government has decided,
                            as a <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi>, to allow Dutch ships sailing
                            to or from Dutch ports to call at a British port outside the danger zone
                            for examination, provided that all such ships inward bound to Holland
                            carry only approved cargoes, and provided that ships outward bound to
                            South America or to Pacific destinations via the Panama Canal will
                            agree, so far as cargo space will permit, to call at a United States
                            port and load American coal outwards to the West Indies, the Panama
                            Canal, the Plate or even the Atlantic islands (Canaries and Cape Verde)
                            if required.</p>
                        <p>This <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> will, however, only last till
                            June 9, by which time a reply from the Netherlands Government is
                            required to the full British proposals. Under this arrangement, Dutch
                            vessels will be able to leave Dutch ports for the United States in
                            ballast. Ballast voyages westwards have always been necessary owing to
                            the absence of cargo for American destinations, but if the United States
                            requires goods from Holland, or elsewhere which could be carried by
                            Dutch vessels, the British Government would doubtless be glad to add
                            this to the conditions, …</p>
                        <p>It will be seen that the above arrangement, purely temporary in its
                            character, only endeavours to meet one of the many requirements of <pb
                                n="1120" xml:id="pg_1120" facs="0366"/>the Allies in the matter of
                            Dutch shipping. The efforts of the British Government have always been,
                            and must continue to be, directed to release Allied ships so far as
                            possible from such essential overseas services as the supply of coal to
                            the Atlantic coaling stations and also to release British ships, and the
                            ships of other European Allies to as great an extent as possible, from
                            transatlantic trades, so as to divert such shipping and also British
                            coal resources to the service of the Allies in European waters. Thus
                            this <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> with Holland dovetails to a
                            certain extent with other proposals already made to the United States
                            Government, notably the suggestion that American ships should, so far as
                            possible, take over the carriage of goods from the United States to the
                            United Kingdom, Italy and France, which are at present carried in
                            British or other European Allied ships, thus releasing the latter for
                            the carriage of coal and other supplies from the United Kingdom to Italy
                            and France.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>On July 3rd, the Department of State and the Department of Commerce were
                            informally acquainted with the situation as regards transit of metals
                            from Belgium to Germany across Dutch territory—a question which had
                            previously been explained by Mr. <persName
                                corresp="frus1917Supp02v01#p_BAJ1">Balfour</persName>’s mission in
                            written communications to the State Department.</p>
                        <p>In view of the military importance of the metals and minerals thus
                            passing from Belgium to Germany and in view of the requisitioning of
                            metals on a large scale by the Germans in Belgium, the British
                            Government had repeatedly urged the Netherlands Government to cease
                            affording passage for these goods (scrap copper, iron lead [<hi
                                rend="italic">sic</hi>], iron ore, sulphur ore and zinc). So far as
                            concerns metals, the Netherlands Government gave an assurance on June
                            the 11th that no more permits for the passage of such cargoes would be
                            given and it was on the strength of this assurance that at the beginning
                            of July at the time of the informal communication with the State
                            Department mentioned above, the British Government authorised the issue
                            of letters of assurance for cargoes of metals for the Netherlands
                            Government by the <hi rend="italic">Noordam</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                                >Zyldyk</hi> from the United States.</p>
                        <p>Notwithstanding this assurance, however, large shipments of lead, old
                            iron and iron ore from Belgium have been passing across Dutch territory
                            and the Netherlands Government are now making reservations as to their
                            original undertaking.</p>

                        <p>The British Government are insisting that the traffic must be effectively
                            stopped and meanwhile no licenses are being given for the export of
                            metals to Holland from the United Kingdom.</p>
                        <p>The British Government would welcome any action that the United States
                            Government can take towards the adoption of a similar policy.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Owing to the shortage of tonnage for the relief of Belgium and northern
                            France, His Majesty’s Government have decided that special measures must
                            be taken, so far as lies in their power, to provide the supplies and the
                            transports necessary for the populations of the occupied territories.
                            They have therefore issued strict instructions to the officers at
                            British ports of examination, and also to all British consular officers
                            concerned that no relief ship is to be delayed at her port of departure
                            or port of examination, for any reason of general policy arising from
                            controversies between His Majesty’s Government and Holland, or the
                            neutral country whose flag the vessel flies.</p>
                        <p>Further, His Majesty’s Government are informing the Netherlands
                            Government that they will raise no objection to the transfer to the
                            Dutch flag of six German vessels in Dutch East Indian ports, provided
                            that these vessels are placed forthwith in the Belgian Relief service,
                            and continue in this service without lying up as long as the Allied
                            Governments require them to do so. Two further conditions are imposed,
                            namely, that the transfer of these vessels must be outright, no German
                            interest being retained in them, and secondly, that they shall unload
                            the cargoes now on board and load full cargoes of goods for the Belgian
                            Relief.</p>
                        <p>The Netherlands Government is also being informed that His Majesty’s
                            Government will agree on similar conditions to raise no objection to the
                            transfer to the Dutch flag of the German steamer offered in compensation
                            for the torpedoed Dutch steamer <hi rend="italic">Blommersdyk.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In addition, a suggestion has been made to His Majesty’s Government that
                            neutral vessels lying in United States ports actually loaded with
                            foodstuffs for neutral European countries, might be made the subject of
                            a bargain with the Government of those countries, by which the greater
                            part of such cargoes should be surrendered to the Relief Commission in
                            return for license to export the balance to their original destinations.
                            This last suggestion clearly raises many difficulties, and His Majesty’s
                            Government have not as yet fully <pb n="1123" xml:id="pg_1123"
                                facs="0369"/>considered the matter, though they would be reluctant
                            to advocate any concessions of this kind to Sweden. The decision in the
                            matter lies, however, with the Government of the United States, within
                            whose jurisdiction these cargoes are, and His Majesty’s Government will
                            be glad to learn the views of the United States Government on the
                            subject.</p>

                        <p>The present memorandum on the subject of Belgian relief is in
                            continuation of that addressed by His Majesty’s Ambassador to the State
                            Department on the 11th instant.</p>
                        <p>His Majesty’s Government have expressed to the Dutch Government their
                            readiness to allow the passage of the Dutch ships which are in American
                            harbours and which are already loaded, on the condition that only
                            one-third of the cargoes goes to Holland, whilst two-thirds shall be
                            destined for Belgian relief. The total of the cargoes on the 42 Dutch
                            ships now in the United States amounts to 194,600 tons, but the
                            representative of the Belgian Relief Committee in London states that at
                            the present moment they can only take a total of about 80,000 tons, so
                            that approximately 115,000 tons of the cargoes of the above-mentioned
                            Dutch ships would go to Holland.</p>
                        <p>The total amount required for relief is 230,000 tons. The 80,000 tons
                            provided by the above proposal leave 150,000 tons. Of this 67,000 tons
                            might be provided by despatching with suitable cargoes the 14 Dutch
                            ships now lying in American ports. The balance might be provided by
                            sending to America Dutch ships now in Holland to fetch relief supplies,
                            and if necessary some of these ships might make a second journey.</p>
                        <p>It is to be remembered that all shipping arrangements have in the past
                            been negotiated with the Netherlands Oversea Trust, who are held
                            responsible for all American shipments. Consequently, a release of the
                            ships’ cargoes now in American waters property comes within the province
                            of the trust. It is also to be remembered that the arrangements which
                            His Majesty’s Government is endeavouring to complete were originally in
                            the way of a bargain in return for facilities accorded at Halifax.
                            Further developments which have grown up are due to influences hostile
                            to our interests and against <pb n="1124" xml:id="pg_1124" facs="0370"
                            />the wishes of the Netherlands Oversea Trust, which body offers the
                            soundest guarantees for a scrupulous fulfilment of their engagements,
                            and His Majesty’s Government consider it most desirable to maintain the
                            prestige and credit of the trust.</p>
                        <p>The advantages to Holland of the above proposals are obvious. She will
                            get a large number of ships released and a considerable portion of their
                            cargoes will be assured her for her own consumption.</p>

                            with members of the commission, the Dutch special commission which is
                            now scheduled to leave for the United States August 18 instead of August
                            15 as reported in my 1192 of August 12,<note n="1" xml:id="d249fn1">Not

                                <item>To persuade the United States Government and the American
                                    people through the medium of the press and influential men that
                                    exports to America [of] foodstuffs and raw materials may be

                                    will probably point out that the Netherlands Oversea Trust has
                                    worked to the satisfaction of the Allies in keeping articles
                                    from overseas and similar articles of domestic origin from
                                    reaching the enemy and that Holland’s agricultural agreement has

                                    Dutch press and in utterances of public and private persons, has
                                    come to fear that the extensive system exercised by England and

                                    Trust practically threatens Holland’s independence and may be

                                    economic alliance against the Centrals, it is possible that the
                                    commission may have the intention of suggesting opportunely that

                        <p>The British Government will be glad to learn the views of the United
                            States Government on any such arrangement. They understand that the
                            United States Government do not contemplate giving licenses for the

                            Holland. It is assumed that they would be prepared to lay down in any
                            case as a condition precedent to the grant of any such licenses that any
                            such oils and fats should only be <pb n="1126" xml:id="pg_1126"

                            Allies. So far as exports from the British Empire are concerned, the
                            dependence of the United Kingdom on Dutch supplies of margarine make it
                            impossible for the British Government to suspend altogether exports to
                            Holland of raw materials for this industry. Provided, however, that the
                            condition of such export is that all the resultant products, with the
                            exception of small quantities of fatty acids, are re-exported from
                            Holland to Allied countries, there would appear to be little danger of
                            increasing supplies available for Dutch home consumption, and thereby
                            diminishing the efficacy of any proposals which the United States
                            Government may contemplate submitting to the Netherlands Government, for
                            the restriction of the export of Dutch home products to Germany.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The British Ambassador is instructed to submit herewith a summary of
                            proposals which the British Government desires to lay before the
                            Netherlands Government as a basis for a comprehensive shipping
                            arrangement. The British Government has been influenced in drafting
                            these proposals by the following considerations.</p>
                        <p>Dutch estimates of requirements recently submitted have been found to be
                            exaggerated by at least 100 per cent, making it advisable to re-consider
                            the whole basis on which shipping negotiations with the Netherlands
                            Government have hitherto been unsuccessfully conducted. Moreover, it
                            appears that the Netherlands Government is at the present moment being
                            subjected to the severest pressure by the German Government in
                            connection with the export of coal from Germany. It is indeed reported
                            from confidential sources that the German Government are refusing to
                            supply coal to Holland, unless Dutch miners are sent to the German
                            mines. As the Dutch coal situation is serious, there is some danger that
                            this demand will eventually be acceded to, unless Dutch coal
                            requirements can be supplied from other sources. In addition to this
                            demand, the German Government appear to have demanded that the
                            Netherlands Government should provide a credit to the German Government
                            of 60 gulden in exchange for every ton of coal exported to Holland in
                            excess of 100,000 tons, this credit to be used for payment of German
                            purchases in Holland.</p>
                        <pb n="1127" xml:id="pg_1127" facs="0373"/>
                        <p>Dutch requirements of British coal, which would, it is understood,
                            relieve them from this German pressure, are between one and two hundred
                            thousand tons a month. By supplying Holland with this quantity the
                            British Government would appear to have an opportunity not only of
                            obtaining Dutch shipping for the service of all the countries associated
                            in the war against Germany, but also of rendering more difficult the
                            financing of German purchases of Dutch agricultural produce.</p>
                        <p>The Dutch requirements of British coal being as large as they are, the
                            enclosed proposals would probably operate to provide for the service of
                            the Commission for Relief in Belgium the greater part of the tonnage
                            which they require (their requirements being understood to be
                            approximately 180,000 tons gross).</p>
                        <p>It will also be observed that care has been taken in drafting these
                            proposals to safeguard the interests of trade between Dutch colonies and
                            United States ports.</p>
                        <p>The British Ambassador is directed to submit these proposals to the
                            United States Government immediately, and to express the earnest hope of
                            His Majesty’s Government for an early expression of their acquiescence.
                            The British Minister at The Hague has been instructed not to submit the
                            scheme to the Netherlands Government until he learns that it has been
                            approved by the Government of the United States.</p>
                        <p>In emphasizing the urgency of this matter, the British Ambassador is also
                            instructed to point out that coal is the only remaining important
                            commodity which Great Britain can offer in exchange for concessions from
                            Holland, and as the arrangement proposed will tie their hands in respect
                            of this commodity, the other desiderata of those associated in the war
                            against Germany—namely, the stoppage of Dutch exports of native produce
                            to the enemy, and the continuance of the supply by Holland of margarine
                            and other commodities indispensable to the Allies—can only be secured by
                            the exercise by the United States Government of their control over
                            important American products needed by Holland.</p>
                        <p>The proposals in question are annexed.</p>

                        <p>No. 4316. On September the 4th last the Netherland Minister received
                            cabled information from the Minister for Foreign Affairs at The Hague to
                            the effect that a conference had taken place between the presidents of
                            the Committees for Relief in Belgium and Northern France, the Dutch
                            delegate at Brussels, who takes the place of the former American
                            delegate, and the Commission for Belgian Relief at Rotterdam. In this
                            conference the conditions of utmost distress prevailing in the invaded
                            districts of Belgium and France were under consideration and special
                            stress was laid on the difficulty to secure a sufficient amount of

                            deep personal sympathy with the Belgian relief work to which the
                            Netherland Government has been glad to lend its direct and active
                            cooperation since the American representatives were obliged to leave the
                            occupied territories, and is anxious to cause the Netherland Government
                            to take any action within its power to alleviate the increasing
                            suffering of the inhabitants of those regions. <persName
                                corresp="frus1917Supp02v01#p_LJJ1">Jonkheer Loudon</persName> is
                            even prepared to place at the disposal of the Belgian Relief the amount
                            of tonnage which it still needs and which has been estimated at 150,000
                            tons. It is however feared that if the Netherland Government gave in to
                            this humanitarian impulse, it would encounter a great obstacle in the
                            public opinion in Holland, which would fail to understand that full
                            cargoes are handled at Rotterdam for the benefit of its neighbours and
                            that for the same purpose Dutch merchant vessels run the risks of the
                            more and more dangerous sea voyage, whereas the population of Holland
                            itself remains without its necessary supplies. Recently the arrival of a
                            cargo <hi rend="italic">exclusivement</hi> destined for the Belgian
                            Relief called forth a manifestation on the part of labor at Rotterdam.

                            be definitely made unless the Netherland Government has reason to expect
                            that it will be placed in a position to supply in a fair measure the
                            requirements of the Dutch population, to distribute among it sufficient
                            bread, which is the principal food of the labor classes, and to dispose

                        <p>In reply to the memorandum of the Netherlands Legation dated September 4,
                            1917, the Department of State desires to say that this memorandum has
                            been submitted to Mr. <persName corresp="frus1917Supp02v01#p_HHC1"
                                >Hoover</persName> for his comments, and the Department is now in
                            receipt of his reply. Mr. <persName corresp="frus1917Supp02v01#p_HHC1"
                                >Hoover</persName> states in substance that the representatives of
                            the Netherlands in the negotiations in question were constantly informed
                            that the question at stake was between themselves and the Commission for
                            Relief in Belgium, and not the United States Food Administration, and
                            that the result of the negotiations was subject to the approval of the
                            Exports Council.</p>
                        <p>It appears further from the statement of Mr. <persName
                                corresp="frus1917Supp02v01#p_HHC1">Hoover</persName>, that the
                            negotiations were begun on the assumption that the ships’ cargoes were
                            made up of a considerable amount of material suitable for human food,
                            the actual amount to be determined by inspection of the cargoes; whereas
                            it turned out that there was practically only a small percentage of
                            human food actually on board the ships, there being no cargo that could
                            be accepted by the Relief Commission <hi rend="italic">in toto.</hi> In
                            conclusion Mr. <persName corresp="frus1917Supp02v01#p_HHC1"
                                >Hoover</persName> states that the object of the negotiations was to
                            secure human food for the Belgians, a certain amount of the cargo
                            suitable for human consumption to go to Holland on the condition that a
                            certain amount of human food be delivered to the Belgian Relief
                            Commission. The matter of securing fodder was not contemplated, and did
                            not enter into the negotiations in any respect.</p>

                            <p>[In statements to the Exports Administrative Board, September 18 and
                                25, 1917, the special commission of the Netherland Government urged
                                the disastrous effects of stopping the exportation of fodder to the
                                Netherlands, but agreed to confine to food-grain cargoes the special
                                arrangement for licensing shipments subject to division with the
                                Commission for Relief in Belgium; the Netherland commission
                                proposed, accordingly, that licenses be granted for some 27 vessels
                                reloaded exclusively with such cargoes, that the fodder grains,
                                etc., be stored, and that about 50 other ships be released for
                                various purposes. These papers are in the War Trade Board files,

                        <p>1457. In a conversation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs to-day I
                            found him rather stirred up at what seemed to him the unfriendly
                            attitude of the Exports Administrative Board. He said that the board had
                            proposed a plan which the Dutch Government with reluctance had agreed to
                            about a fortnight ago and he could not understand why there should be
                            delay in putting it into effect unless indeed the board had thought of a
                            new proposition after their own proposal had been agreed to. He said
                            that two things were particularly worrying him at the moment: (1) your
                            decision which had been telegraphed him by <persName
                                corresp="frus1917Supp02v01#p_RCV1">Rappard</persName> to refuse
                            bunker coal to Dutch vessels to Netherland Indies unless they agree to
                            discharge their return cargoes in the United States,<note n="1"

                            reports that Dutch vessels in the United States are to be requisitioned.

                            admitted that with the 40 per cent reduction in breadstuffs consumption
                            now in force Dutch internal supplies would not be exhausted before
                            March. If the statements regarding requisitionings are untrue could you
                            not so inform me.</p>
                        <p>Growing agitation here might be counteracted by a quick decision of the
                            Exports Administrative Board. Is the inability to decide upon a basic
                            policy due to failure to secure information requested from Holland?
                                <persName corresp="frus1917Supp02v01#p_LJJ1">Loudon</persName>
                            states emphatically that everything requested has been given. From
                            British and other good sources it appears that the Dutch have faithfully
                            lived up to their agreements and that nothing is now going to Germany
                            that they have agreed should not go. Unless demanded by greater
                            exigencies it would appear unwise to drive them into changing this
                            attitude.</p>

                            </hi>: With reference to our conversation of to-day the following is the
                            substance of a telegram which we have just received from London.</p>

                        <p>In view of the fact that the Netherlands Government have returned no
                            satisfactory reply to the urgent representations which were made to them
                            by His Majesty’s Government with a view to the definite discontinuance
                            of transit facilities for cement, gravel, sand, etc., between Germany
                            and Belgium, His Majesty’s Government have been compelled to refuse
                            facilities for the transmission of Dutch commercial cables. The
                            Netherlands Government were some time ago warned that this action would
                            be taken.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="frus1917Supp02v01#p_BAJ1">Balfour</persName> adds
                            that as the matter is one which is of immediate military importance it
                            would be of great advantage if your Government could see their way to
                            supporting the British Government in this question.</p>

                        <p>726. For your information. On October 12 following memorandum was handed
                            by the Exports Administrative Board to the Netherlands commission in
                            this country: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>The Holland Government commission on the 18th of September
                                    presented in person a memorandum to the Exports Administrative
                                    Board, and on September 25 addressed a letter to the board
                                    making certain proposals.</p>
                                <p>In considering the points raised in the memorandum and letter,
                                    the board desires to review the note presented to the Holland
                                    Government by the Exports Council on the 24th day of July,

                                <p>This note expressed the hope that certain matters mentioned
                                    therein would receive the earnest and earliest possible
                                    consideration of the Holland Government.</p>
                                <p>Among other matters mentioned there was requested full
                                    information as to the production, consumption and needs of the
                                    people of Holland, and particularly of foodstuffs set out in the
                                    form of protein, fats and carbohydrates.</p>
                                <p>The vital interest of the United States in the supplies being
                                    furnished by Holland to the Central Empires was expressed, and
                                    information was requested as to the kind and quantity of exports
                                    being thus made. It was also stated that pending a mutual
                                    arrangement as to furnishing of supplies to Holland or lending
                                    assistance in obtaining supplies for Holland, the United States
                                    would consider that any exports to the Central Empires must be
                                    taken as in reduction of the amount of foodstuffs or other
                                    commodities for the obtaining of which Holland might be given
                                    assistance.</p>
                                <pb n="1137" xml:id="pg_1137" facs="0383"/>
                                <p>The Exports Administrative Board, in view of the foregoing,
                                    wishes to make the following observations:</p>
                                <p>1. Since the 24th day of July (the date of the Exports Council
                                    note) the board has been waiting for the information requested.
                                    The Minister from Holland to the United States in answer to
                                    queries of the board has stated from time to time that the
                                    commission being sent by his Government would fetch full
                                    particulars concerning all matters requested.</p>
                                <p>The board would be pleased if, providing the commission has this
                                    information, it would make the same available in order that the
                                    board may know what the needs of the people of Holland are.</p>
                                <p>2. The memorandum presented to the Exports Administrative Board
                                    on the 18th of September<note n="1" xml:id="d258fn2">Not
                                        printed.</note> draws the conclusion that the United States
                                    is not inclined to grant licenses for export of fodder to
                                    Holland.</p>
                                <p>The board knows of no reason for this conclusion. On the contrary
                                    the information requested has as one of its objects the
                                    determining of the needs of Holland for fodder, and if Holland
                                    has such needs, then the board would be glad to grant licenses
                                    for the export of such commodities as can be spared by the
                                    United States even though this may mean considerable sacrifice,
                                    and notwithstanding that the United States can ill afford to let
                                    go such articles at the present time.</p>
                                <p>The killing off of live stock as suggested in the memorandum
                                    would appear therefore to be entirely unnecessary and the United
                                    States would regret if this should occur, and especially if the
                                    famous dairy herds of Holland should be thus depleted.</p>
                                <p>3. The Exports Administrative Board understands that
                                    notwithstanding the suggestion that exports into the Central
                                    Empires should be considered as in reduction of imports to be
                                    expected from the United States, that large quantities of
                                    various commodities have continued to be exported.</p>
                                <p>The Exports Administrative Board therefore wishes to point out to
                                    the Holland Government commission clearly that it cannot license
                                    for export foodstuffs, fodder and other materials and
                                    commodities when such articles are to be used— <list>

                                            origin and ownership being sent directly to the enemy
                                            army and to the enemy trenches.</item>
                                    </list>
                                </p>
                                <pb n="1138" xml:id="pg_1138" facs="0384"/>
                                <p>If Holland is to continue to supply what is equivalent to a large
                                    part of the ration of the Germany Army, it must follow that the
                                    United States cannot supply directly nor can it lend assistance
                                    in obtaining those things which the Holland Government
                                    commission requests.</p>
                                <p>4. The proposal put forward by the Holland Government commission
                                    for the disposal of cargoes and for the bunkering of ships lying
                                    in United States harbors provides for the employment of Holland
                                    tonnage, which object the board would be glad to facilitate, but
                                    the proposal gives no assurance that Holland will not employ the
                                    commodities for which export licenses are requested and continue
                                    to employ her resources for the benefit of the enemy. The
                                    proposal is therefore not acceptable.</p>
                                <p>In the meantime, pending negotiations, the Exports Administrative
                                    Board cannot agree to grant licenses for coal and ships supplies
                                    to Dutch vessels bound for Holland or Scandinavia or when
                                    proceeding to other points to procure cargoes destined for
                                    Holland or Scandinavia, when it has no assurance as to the
                                    purpose for which such cargoes are to be employed.</p>
                                <p>5. The board wishes to suggest, pending the discussion of the
                                    above matters, the advisability of employing Holland tonnage in
                                    increasing the available quantity or foodstuffs in the United
                                    States by assisting in bringing into the United States such
                                    commodities from Java, Australia, Africa, the Far East, South
                                    America, or other places as would release for export a like
                                    quantity of other or similar goods, or of employing the tonnage
                                    in the worthy causes of sending supplies to Belgium for the
                                    Commission for Relief in Belgium.</p>
                                <p>The board hopes to arrive at a satisfactory conclusion with the
                                    Holland Government commission after a discussion, and will
                                    therefore be glad to have the information suggested at the
                                    earliest moment.</p>

                        <p>The United States Minister at The Hague has informed the Minister of
                            Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands that the articles published in the
                            press about the final decision of the United States concerning the
                            embargo were inaccurate and that the United States Government wishes to
                            consider the treatment of neutrals in a friendly spirit of justice, its
                            only aim being to prevent American articles from aiding the Central
                            powers and to come to an understanding concerning the matter of
                            tonnage.</p>
                        <p>Her Majesty’s Minister of Foreign Affairs in his answer to the United
                            States Minister has been very grateful for that expression <pb n="1139"
                                xml:id="pg_1139" facs="0385"/>of those friendly sentiments but has
                            not been able to conceal to Mr. <persName
                                corresp="frus1917Supp02v01#p_GJW1">Garrett</persName>, that the
                            latest events have created the impression in the Netherlands that
                            Holland is not treated by the United States Government in a friendly
                            way.</p>
                        <p>On September 10 the Netherland Minister presented to the Secretary of
                            State under No. 4316 a proposition concerning Dutch tonnage to be put at
                            the disposal of the Belgian Relief.<note n="1" xml:id="d259fn1">

                                1133</ref>.</note> Till to date no answer to that proposal has been
                            given and in the meantime Swedish and Norwegian steamers have been
                            chartered for the Belgian Relief at the cost of 130 guilders pro ton,
                            whereas the Netherland Government offered transport for 65 guilders.</p>
                        <p>Grains belonging to the Netherland Government are allowed to deteriorate
                            in Dutch bottoms notwithstanding the fact that the Netherlands proposed
                            to transport same to Europe on conditions highly advantageous to the
                            Belgian Relief.</p>
                        <p>The Netherland Fleet is kept in the United States harbours, which entails
                            enormous expenses to the Netherlands Government.</p>
                        <p>The sailing of the <hi rend="italic">New Amsterdam</hi> is refused
                            without any valid reason.</p>
                        <p>All this happens notwithstanding the fact that we render great service to
                            the United States Government by our Pacific fleet and by importing raw
                            materials from our East Indian possessions.</p>
                        <p>It is evident that, as a neutral country, we cannot dispose of our
                            resources one-sidedly and therefore our offer of tonnage for the Belgian
                            Relief is founded on an acceptable basis.</p>
                        <p>Before an understanding has been arrived at concerning the proposal
                            contained in memorandum No. 4316, offered to the Secretary of State by
                            the Netherland Minister on September 10 and also concerning the proposal
                            submitted by the commission to the Exports Administrative Board,<note
                                n="2" xml:id="d259fn2">Not printed.</note> the Netherland Government
                            does not feel justified to allow their shipowners any other employment
                            of their vessels, and the inaction of the fleet thus caused by the
                            attitude of the United States means a loss of tonnage detrimental to the
                            United States as well as to the Netherlands.</p>
                        <p>The Netherland Government to their utmost regret observe that the public
                            opinion in the Netherlands resents the attitude of the United States
                            Government toward a country with whom till now only the most friendly
                            relations have existed.</p>

                        <p>1508. You will have seen from the recent press summaries that agitation
                            in the papers now chiefly over the gravel controversy with Great Britain
                            and the drastic cutting off commercial cables with which our alleged
                            harsh intentions and alleged unfriendly procrastination in reaching
                            agreement on outstanding questions are frequently coupled. In regard to
                            the gravel controversy <persName corresp="frus1917Supp02v01#p_LJJ1"
                                >Loudon</persName> tells me that his Government is firmly decided
                            not to yield to such methods as the British are employing. He will act,
                            however, immediately [to] stop all the gravel and sand transit if
                            British Government will give him proofs that this material is being put
                            to military use. The Dutch engineers who have investigated the matter
                            report that all this material is being used for repairs of roads,
                            canals, etc., outside army zones. It does not appear that the Dutch
                            officers were taken into the army zones. British Minister tells me he
                            has given convincing proofs of military usage. He says that matter is so
                            serious to British and French troops that there can be no compromise. I
                            understand that the Dutch Government will welcome the receipt of proofs
                            which will enable it to stop the traffic and say to Germany that it is
                            done because Germany has broken faith by using the material for purposes
                            she had promised not to put it to. Without such proof they dare not take
                            action which might serve Germany as excuse for denouncement of Rhine
                            treaty which Germany has long desired to be freed from. The proofs
                            submitted, as far as I have been able to learn, are not necessarily
                            convincing although they undoubtedly tend to show destination and use of
                            the material in army zones.</p>
                        <p>In regard to criticism of us it is, when you come down to it, based, if
                            on anything, largely on guesses at our intentions. Of course, we cannot
                            be dissociated from those with whom we are fighting but the agitation
                            against us helps neither Holland not ourselves. I have made informal use
                            of your telegram of October 6<note n="1" xml:id="d260fn1">
                                <hi rend="italic">Ante</hi>, <ref target="#pg_960">p.
                                960</ref>.</note> but I suggest that the situation might be cleared
                            by a statement from you or by me under your instruction. This people …
                            think now that we are wilfully holding at New York not only their ships
                            but cargoes which they have bought and paid for which are deteriorating
                            and may be wasted entirely and that this is an action that <pb n="1141"
                                xml:id="pg_1141" facs="0387"/>benefits nobody. They say that their
                            commission reports itself up against stone wall; that it is met by the
                            reiterated statement of the Exports Board, “As long as Holland exports
                            anything to Germany nothing shall go from the United States to Holland.”
                            This does not seem to agree with your statement of our aims in your
                            October 6.</p>
                        <p>It is impossible here for the nurses [<hi rend="italic">masses</hi>] and
                            press to comprehend this situation given the absence of authentic news
                            or of official statements.</p>
                        <p>Aside from the rationing, shipping, bunker and other questions, it would
                            seem that unless certain industries are supplied with raw materials at
                            least in sufficient quantities to keep them going they must shut down
                            and throw out of employment labor which may be forced to seek employment
                            in German munition factories. I am informed that one-sixth of the
                            regular operatives in Dutch spinneries is already employed in Germany.
                            There are things which we can very well let them have with advantage to
                            both of us that no way, either as raw material or after manufacture, can
                            be of benefit to Germany. For example hardware, cotton, electric
                            apparatus, soda, cotton-seed oil for manufacturing margarine, which goes
                            to England except 10 per cent consumed here, lubricating gas and other
                            mineral oils, tanning material, turpentine. It is said for instance that
                            three or four shiploads of gas [and] oil would have relieved the coal
                            situation to such an extent that Holland would have been able to use
                            greater strength versus Germany during the negotiations which led to the
                            agreement mentioned in my 1449, October 7.<note n="1" xml:id="d260fn2"

                                <hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. <persName
                                        corresp="frus1917Supp02v01#p_MVC1">McCormick</persName>
                                </hi>: You asked me on Tuesday whether I had anything to say about
                                Holland in anticipation of your meeting with the Dutch mission
                                either to-day or to-morrow. I replied in the negative, because I
                                thought that our views had all been put before you many times, and I
                                did not want to bore you by reiteration. I think, however, that the
                                board had better have in their hands the enclosed summary, taken
                                from a recent Foreign Office telegram, which is intended to state
                                the minimum that we hope will be obtained. I think there is nothing
                                new in this summary, except point 2, regarding the loan, which is
                                analogous to the provision inserted in the proposed agreement with
                                Denmark.</p>
                            <p>I would also draw your attention to the prohibition of export from
                                Holland of hides, horses, charcoal and leather. As regards horses,
                                we have a despatch from the Foreign Office, drawing attention to the
                                very large importation of automobiles by Holland in the past,
                                including motor cycles, etc., and this despatch suggests both that
                                an absolute prohibition against the export of motor vehicles of all
                                kinds to enemy countries should be imposed by Holland, and that the
                                export of horses to enemy countries should be likewise prohibited on
                                the replacement principle.</p>
                            <p>You will observe that the enclosed summary suggests that imports of
                                feeding stuffs and fertilizers should be absolutely refused to
                                Holland. This I do not think entirely agrees with your position, as
                                taken up in your memorandum of October 12th, but I think we all
                                agree on the principle (the exact application of which is a question
                                of statistics) that no feeding stuffs should be allowed to Holland
                                beyond the needs of her own population solely, and that if, in order
                                to supply the needs of her own population, some feeding stuffs have
                                to be imported into Holland, then certainly Holland should be
                                allowed to import no oils or fats, since <hi rend="italic">ex
                                    hypothesi</hi> she would have sufficient dairy products to
                                supply her fat needs.</p>
                            <p>Yours very truly,</p>

                            short period.</p>
                        <p>In the meantime the reports I get from my Government make it clear to me
                            that the general conditions in my country become worse and worse and
                            that the Netherland Government looks forward with great anxiety to a
                            solution of the problem of getting raw materials either from America or
                            from our own colonies, and to a means to find employment for the tied-up
                            Netherland vessels.</p>
                        <p>The commission having left the Netherlands already three months ago, the
                            situation in Holland having become much more serious, the commission
                            having realized that the standpoint taken by the U. S. Government
                            regarding the export to Holland from this country and regarding the
                            delivery of bunker coal to ships, differs greatly from what the
                            Netherland Government supposed it to be at the moment the commission
                            left Holland, I have thought it advisable to send the president of our
                            commission, Mr. <persName>van Vollenhoven</persName>, to Holland, in
                            order to discuss with Her Majesty’s Government what might be done to
                            come to the so much wished-for understanding with the U. S.
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>As there was no certainty that any of our ships would be able to leave
                            for Holland in the near future, I availed myself of the opportunity
                            offered to me by the presence of Her Majesty’s battleship <hi

                            left this morning. Mr. <persName>van Vollenhoven</persName> hopes to
                            return to America at the first occasion that will present itself, and in
                            the meantime the other members of the commission and myself are always
                            ready and at your disposal to continue the impending negotiations with
                            the War Trade Board or with whomsoever you will be kind enough to

                            Following facts regarding Dutch-German agreement have just been obtained
                            from Dutch Foreign Office in the strictest confidence.</p>
                        <p>Holland was forced to capitulate particularly on the question of credit
                            [and?] on the question of the threatened coal famine.</p>
                        <p>Agreement runs from October 1, 1917, until April 1, 1918.</p>
                        <p>Holland is to receive 200,000 tons German coal per month at 45 florins
                            per ton and 50,000 Belgian coal at 32 florins and [<hi rend="italic"
                                >at?</hi>] 50 cents.</p>
                        <p>Holland is to receive 20,000 tons structural and shipbuilding iron and
                            steel per month. Germany at first required that the shipbuilding steel
                            should be used only for building and repairing ships which [Holland]
                            guaranteed not to charter, sell or trade to or in interest of the enemy
                            during the war. Question not settled and pending settlement parts
                            essential for completion are being withheld. Foreign Office confidently
                            expects that it will arrange that vessels repaired or built with this
                            steel will be allowed to trade to enemy ports if in Dutch interests even
                            when carrying cargo to enemy ports.</p>
                        <p>Holland’s trade with Austria and Switzerland to be free from all German
                            transit restrictions, see Austro-Hungarian arrangement below.</p>
                        <p>Germany will grant absolute safety to Dutch colliers which go to England
                            to fetch coal if each individual ship is accompanied by paddle boat.
                            These conditions will make it almost impossible to bring appreciable
                            amounts of English coal except under convoy. For the present, Dutch
                            vessels in small numbers are in practice following convoys both ways
                            with the tacit consent of British. Germany agrees unofficially that
                            tankers of American and Bataafsche petroleum companies on which half
                            capital is said to be owned by Standard Oil and Shell companies,
                            respectively, will not be considered as prize by German courts. This
                            will possibly facilitate trade of these vessels to Holland.</p>
                        <p>Germany will continue to supply beet seed, salt, agricultural machinery,
                            potash, lime, chemicals, dyes, <hi rend="italic">et cetera</hi>, so far
                            as she can spare them in the quantities which Holland requires.</p>
                        <p>Germany has agreed to widen free passage in the North Sea from present
                            minimum width of two and one-half miles to minimum width of ten
                            miles.</p>
                        <pb n="1146" xml:id="pg_1146" facs="0392"/>
                        <p>Holland agrees to make no objection to granting of Dutch credit of
                            11,250,000 florins per month. Dutch syndicate of importers of German
                            coal is being formed to finance 5,000,000 florins of this per month.
                            Similar syndicate of importers of German steel is being formed to accept
                            2,250,000 florins per month and export <hi rend="italic">centrale</hi>
                            will issue 4,000,000 florins per month of its notes on the security of
                            notes drawn in gilders on the principal German banks for that sum.
                            Netherlands Bank has volunteered to re-discount this total credit at
                            rumored nominal rate of about 90 per cent. It is noticeable that rate of
                            exchange on Berlin has risen in the past four weeks from about 29 to 33
                            florins per hundred marks. Above credit to be restricted to 33 florins
                            per ton of coal actually imported and 150 florins per ton iron and steel
                            actually imported. Holland agrees to export minimum quantity of butter
                            and cheese to Germany. Exact quantity unknown but Foreign Office and
                            Agricultural Export Bureau state that this requirement is but a sop
                            obtained by German negotiators for their Berlin principals and that the
                            quantity is far below normal and probably actual exports and may be
                            revised downwards if domestic production is below normal.</p>
                        <p>I have no reason to believe that Germany required anything further of
                            Holland but, on contrary, Germany apparently continually followed
                            [policy] of befriending Holland. However, they showed their teeth early
                            negotiations by stating that they would have no interest in leaving free
                            passage in North Sea open unless Holland satisfactorily settled credit
                            question and also by cutting off coal from August 1 until about October
                            4 when agreement was finally reached.</p>
                        <p>Dutch Foreign Office and people apparently feel that they have been
                            fairly reasonably treated by Germans and [expect] renewal of agreement
                            on April 1, 1918.</p>
                        <p>It is understood that the British had formerly received Dutch credit of
                            22,000,000 florins for the purchase of Java sugar and just now a further
                            7,500,000 florins for the same purpose. This credit effected by
                            re-discount of British Treasury notes by leading Dutch banks.</p>
                        <p>Austro-Hungarian agreement provides that those countries provide Holland
                            with sawed oak wood, pine boards, oak timber, soft woods, 50 cisterns
                            lubricating oils, asphalt, tanning bark, calves’ stomachs, <hi
                                rend="italic">et cetera</hi>. In return for which a private
                            syndicate of Dutch bankers understood to be headed by Netherlands Bank
                            and Rotterdam Bank furnish 2,800,000 florins per month credit to Austria
                            and 1,200,000 florins to Hungary. Apparently this separate agreement is
                            considered by Austria-Hungary as species of declaration from Germany and
                            has little other significance except that tanning <pb n="1147"
                                xml:id="pg_1147" facs="0393"/>materials and lubricating oil are

                            certain conditions and sentiments in the Netherlands, mainly due to the
                            entrance of the United States into the war. I should hesitate about
                            making this report were it not for the concluding paragraph of General
                            Consular Instruction No. 536, of July 21, 1917, on “Political Events of
                            Interest in Foreign Countries,” where justification may be inferred from
                            this direction: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>Especial attention should be paid to the effect of American
                                    participation in the war and the attitude toward the

                        <p>Merely as explanatory, I would say that six years’ official residence in
                            Holland has brought me into acquaintanceship, intimate in some cases,
                            with many Dutch people, of divers classes, from which has naturally been
                            gained a clear knowledge of the sentiments prevailing in private,
                            official, and commercial circles.</p>
                        <pb n="1148" xml:id="pg_1148" facs="0394"/>
                        <p>From the beginning of the war up to a year ago, the sentiment of fully
                            three-fourths of the Dutch people was evidently pro-Ally. This
                            preponderance was probably even greater in Amsterdam and vicinity and
                            along the Belgian border, where the people had personal knowledge of
                            German atrocities. The principal financial, commercial, and professional
                            people of Amsterdam were pro-Ally, and also the masses of the people. If
                            a pro-German was found, it was usually he or she who had family
                            connections in Germany, or more important business or professional
                            relations with Germany than with the Allied countries. Occasionally it
                            would be a person whose affairs other than with Germany had suffered
                            from the British blockade and censorship. Army officers generally
                            inclined toward Germany from admiration of its remarkable organization.
                            But where sentiment was unaffected by personal considerations, and was
                            based solely upon ideals of right and wrong and justice and humanity, it
                            was always, so far as I could perceive, pro-Ally.</p>
                        <p>During the past year, a sentiment rather anti-English has been developing
                            because of severe British restrictions, particularly upon Dutch
                            shipping. More indignation has been apparent against this, at times,
                            than against the ruthless destruction of Dutch ships, with loss of life,
                            by the Germans. When asked why they were more indignant over a smaller
                            than over a greater offense, the Dutch would reply that they expected
                            anything from the Germans, but did not expect harsh treatment from the
                            British, whom they regarded as friends.</p>
                        <p>The entrance of the United States into the war was not received by the
                            Dutch people with general approval. Some greeted it with enthusiasm, but
                            more, among them ardent friends of the Allies, expressed fear that it
                            would increase the difficulties with which Holland was contending. The
                            results, in their opinion, have justified that fear. The detention of
                            Dutch ships and of Dutch passengers in American harbors and the reported
                            refusal of the American authorities to permit the export of any
                            foodstuffs to Holland and even to grant coal to ships returning from
                            Dutch colonial and other ports, together with the announcement that the
                            Dutch commission sent to the United States has failed to secure any
                            concessions whatever, have led to very severe criticism by people from
                            whom but a few months ago was heard only ardent expressions in favor of
                            the Allies. One of Holland’s foremost men … has just told me that the
                            present severe methods were turning the people toward Germany. Assuming
                            this to be true, and Germany aware of it, the opportunity of that
                            country is manifest. It could be so generous in granting supplies of
                            coal and iron and in pledging safety to Dutch shipping that, opposed to
                            the presumed hostility of England and of the United <pb n="1149"
                                xml:id="pg_1149" facs="0395"/>States in particular, it would seem to
                            be a staunch friend in sore need, and might be able to secure
                            concessions of serious consequence to the Allies. One hears, in talk,
                            that the Scheldt might be opened to the Germans, and that they might
                            even be granted special privileges at the ports of Amsterdam and
                            Rotterdam. One hears the belief expressed with angry indignation that
                            English influence is controlling the United States, and that Lord
                                <persName corresp="frus1917Supp02v01#p_NVA1">Northcliffe</persName>
                            is “making trouble for Holland” during his sojourn in the United States.
                            Mention is heard of the rupture of diplomatic relations and even of war
                            with the United States, and the remark is not uncommon that Holland is
                            being “forced into the arms of Germany.”</p>
                        <p>Large manufacturers have told the writer that they would prefer to be
                            entirely independent of Germany and receive all their supplies from
                            England and the United States, but that this was rendered impossible by
                            those countries themselves. One of these manufacturers states that a
                            cargo of iron for which he has urgent need is detained at New York on
                            one of the Dutch ships. This manufacturer, one of the most important in
                            Holland, was formerly strongly pro-Ally. Now his expressed sentiments,
                            while not distinctly pro-German, are materially changed. It is
                            presumable that he is representative of many other manufacturers.</p>
                        <p>It is peculiarly unfortunate that the worst sufferers from the present
                            severe regulations have been strong friends of the Allies from the
                            beginning of the war.</p>
                        <p>Everywhere, now, one hears not merely surprise and regret at the attitude
                            of the United States, but also indignant denunciation. It is asked what
                            Holland has done to deserve such treatment. It is said that this country
                            must have coal and iron from Germany, because it cannot obtain them
                            elsewhere, and that it must pay therefor with foods from its surplus
                            products, but that the quantity of the foods which it sends to Germany
                            in a whole year would scarcely feed the people of that country one day.
                            It is also recalled that at the time of the American Revolution the
                            Dutch were most friendly to the struggling colonies; that they supplied
                            them freely with money, and also with a warship built at Amsterdam; and
                            that Holland was the first country to recognize the independence of the
                            colonies and the first to receive a Minister from the new Republic. It
                            is also declared that the present treatment of Holland by the United
                            States is in direct conflict with its own expressions of solicitude for
                            the freedom and fair treatment of the small nations, and that among its
                            announced objects in entering the war to insure those rights to such
                            nations. This opinion as to the inconsistency of the United States
                            appears to be so strong that no amount of argument that it is erroneous
                            and based upon mistaken premises produces any visible effect.</p>
                        <pb n="1150" xml:id="pg_1150" facs="0396"/>
                        <p>On the whole, the present situation as regards the relations between
                            Holland and the United States is really critical. I do not, of course,
                            presume to suggest anything, but only to point out facts and to quote
                            opinions which are freely and generally expressed, not only by the
                            average Dutch citizen, but also by persons of great influence and of

                            of November 20 for <persName corresp="frus1917Supp02v01#p_HEM1"
                                >House</persName> was delivered to him on the eve of his departure
                            for France. He asked me to take subject up with the British Government
                            and answer. Mr. <persName corresp="frus1917Supp02v01#p_BAJ1"
                                >Balfour</persName> and <persName corresp="frus1917Supp02v01#p_CLR1"
                                >Lord Robert Cecil</persName> think that requisitioning the Dutch
                            ships would cause irritation in Holland but neither they nor the
                            military and naval authorities have the least fear that it would drive
                            the Dutch into war against us. One of several strong reasons why they
                            would not join Germany is the certainty that they would lose their
                            colonies. …</p>
                        <p>A Dutch commission is now here discussing with <persName
                                corresp="frus1917Supp02v01#p_CLR1">Lord Robert Cecil</persName> the
                            whole relations of Holland to the Entente powers. <persName
                                corresp="frus1917Supp02v01#p_CLR1">Cecil</persName> makes the
                            suggestion that if we decide to requisition the Dutch ships in American
                            ports we refrain from making a dramatic seizure of them all at once. If
                            a small number of them be requisitioned with the best understanding that
                            can be made with the shipowners, the Dutch Government will be easier to
                            deal with thereafter. This was the general plan followed by the British
                            with Norway. The success of it in <persName
                                corresp="frus1917Supp02v01#p_CLR1">Cecil</persName>’s opinion will
                            depend on the secrecy with which it be done. Complete secrecy will
                            greatly lessen Dutch humiliation and irritation and is here regarded as
                            absolutely necessary. If you decide to requisition these ships the
                            irritation would be softened by the exportation to Holland of certain
                            well-chosen commodities.</p>

                                proposals or do not speedily reply to them, it will be advisable
                                that the British Government should requisition Swedish ships now in
                                United Kingdom ports on the understanding that the United States
                                Government will requisition Dutch and, perhaps, also Swedish ships
                                in United States ports.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>As I explained to Mr. <persName corresp="frus1917Supp02v01#p_MFC1"
                                >Munson</persName>, we shall probably be unable to requisition Dutch
                            ships in United Kingdom ports because, if we proceed with our
                            provisional agreement with the Netherlands Oversea Trust, as to tonnage
                            for Belgian Relief (a course which I understand the American delegates
                            in London have approved), all Dutch ships in United Kingdom ports will
                            be needed to carry coal to Holland.</p>
                        <p>The British Government hopes, as has already been intimated in our
                            official note to the Secretary of State on the general tonnage question,
                            that the United States Government will feel itself in a position to
                            requisition Dutch ships in United States ports if the Dutch Government,
                            or the Dutch owners, refuse to employ them in some such manner as the
                            above, which in the present wheat situation may be regarded as essential
                            to the feeding of the European nations, neutral as well as Allied. We
                            understand that the Dutch have already failed to reply to a reasonable
                            proposal on these lines submitted to them by the War Trade Board in
                            respect of the 27 empty Dutch ships now in your ports and we venture to
                            submit for your consideration the question whether this failure does not
                            in itself form a ground for requisitioning these 27 ships even before
                            the above comprehensive <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> has been
                            discussed with the Dutch Government. This applies, especially, to cases
                            where <pb n="1153" xml:id="pg_1153" facs="0399"/>the Dutch owners are
                            willing to acquiesce in requisitioning measures and the British
                            Government does not anticipate that any bad effects will be produced on
                            pending negotiations by such measures, especially if requisitions take
                            place gradually and quietly.</p>

                        <p>1742. There is evidently a desire in London that the permanent stoppage
                            of transit from Germany to Belgium through Holland of all sand and
                            gravel should be demanded by the United States as a condition precedent
                            to granting rations to the Netherlands, releasing Dutch vessels and
                            adopting general economic agreement with this country. Such a demand at
                            the present time seems unnecessary.</p>
                        <p>The British attempt to force stoppage of this traffic by cutting off
                            commercial cables has been complete failure so far and the view of their
                            representatives here is that they have no further means of bringing
                            pressure. … We should help them if possible in bringing about
                            undertaking that this traffic cannot again be resumed as it was of
                            serious consequence to the British and French troops and may be to our
                            own. On the other hand we should be careful not to allow ourselves to be
                            used in a way that would simply shift odium <pb n="1154"
                                xml:id="pg_1154" facs="0400"/>on us without accomplishing our
                            object. In the minds of most Dutch people America’s withholding food and
                            detention of ships will quickly obliterate memory of temporary
                            inconvenience of the British stoppage of commercial cables. The sand,
                            gravel transit traffic stopped November 15 and it is expected to resume
                            it about mid-March. The prohibition of commercial cables though slightly
                            relaxed is still in force.</p>
                        <p>It would seem that what we, as well as the British, want might be
                            accomplished more certainly if further pressure in this matter be not
                            attempted until after we have come to an agreement as to rationing and
                            use of ships. There is undoubtedly a belief here that the Dutch case in
                            the transit matter is not a good one and that the traffic was wrong.

                                >Loudon</persName> has asked the German Government’s permission to
                            send three Dutch officers to investigate the use of gravel and sand in
                            parts of occupied districts not previously visited by Dutch officers and
                            where it is presumed the material is being used for war purposes.
                            Germany has not yet answered. If this new investigation or its refusal
                            gives the Dutch an excuse it is not impossible that they will find the
                            strength and courage to refuse this transit next year. However, if no
                            other satisfactory solution is found the British would have a much
                            stronger weapon of coercion than they have yet used if, we having
                            already agreed to rationing and release of ships, they could hold or
                            threaten to hold up these ships at Halifax.</p>

                            these same materials was an important one but at the instance of the

                            taken on it by the American Government.</p>
                        <p>In a second and subordinate committee members [<hi rend="italic">meeting

                            principle of not allowing fodder or fertilizer to be imported into
                            Holland was maintained and justified on the grounds that if such traffic
                            were allowed the amount of the exportable surplus in which Germany would
                            share would become larger. The Dutch maintained that this was not the
                            case and Allies stated that they could not change this policy unless
                            proof were advanced by the Dutch that supported their above contention.
                            This the Dutch agreed to submit, delivering it on the night of the 12th.
                            Their attempted proof was examined yesterday and in the opinion of the
                            Allies it was found to have no weight. It was therefore decided to tell
                            the Dutch to-day that they had advanced nothing to cause the Allies to
                            alter principle 1.</p>

                            in London has just asked Dutch to furnish full information as to entire
                            Dutch merchant fleet. When this is obtained, when the exact ration
                            figures <pb n="1158" xml:id="pg_1158" facs="0404"/>are determined, and
                            when a calculation is made of the requirements of Dutch inter-colonial
                            trade, we will immediately calculate and cable a statement of the
                            remaining tonnage which is to be placed at the disposal of the Allies as
                            agreed between them. The British are very anxious to commence
                            immediately the discussion of the trades insisted upon. This surplus
                            Dutch tonnage will be used but as we have no authorized representatives
                            of the United States Shipping Board here it is very difficult for me to
                            conduct these discussions.</p>
                        <p>The British are also anxious to consider a second <hi rend="italic">modus
                                vivendi</hi> which might supplement my first or in case the first
                            fails replace it which would call into immediate operation additional
                            Dutch vessels principally those now in Dutch ports. As this proposed
                            British <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> involves allocating
                            considerable Dutch tonnage in various trades I am again considerably
                            handicapped by lack of instructions and by not having in London a
                            representative of the Shipping Board.</p>

                            to conform to the figures of 1913. The Swiss explain that before the war
                            they drew much of their wheat from Russia and Roumania which now they
                            are obliged to get from America. The large increase in imports from the
                            United States does not mean that Switzerland is shipping surplus of food
                            or raw materials to Germany but that these supplies are actually needed
                            in Switzerland. Swiss Foreign Office explains this to me with much care
                            and emphasis and assures the President of the United States that the
                            Swiss Society of Surveillance guards exports and imports very severely
                            and assures the absolute regularity of commercial relations of
                            Switzerland with the Allies. This fact is borne out by British Minister
                            here who naturally watches the situation very closely and who assures me
                            privately that his Government is very well satisfied with the present
                            attitude of Switzerland. There is great sympathy for Switzerland on the
                            part of France and England. Switzerland has no seaport and in spite of
                            her great need for charity and her kindness to all parties she is at the
                            mercy of conflicting interests and warring nations clamoring for
                            compensation and restricting her commercial independence. As exaggerated
                            press reports have initiated public opinion and created some feeling
                            against the United States, I suggest that I be authorized to communicate
                            something like the following to the Swiss Foreign Office: <quote

                                    through it to the Swiss people, the assurance that the measures

                                    prevent the exportation of foodstuffs and other supplies from
                                    the United States into Germany are in no wise directed against
                                    the legitimate requirements of Switzerland. The United States
                                    has entered into this war to defend the rights of neutrals
                                    unjustly infringed by illegal submarine warfare as conducted by
                                    Germany. To prevent supplies from reaching Germany forms but one
                                    of the measures of war which my Government has adopted and this
                                    measure as all others is directed at Germany and in no wise at
                                    Switzerland, a sister Republic with which the Government and
                                    people of the United States are attached by ties of deep and
                                    lasting friendship.</p>

                        <p>559. Your 824, April 24, 5 p.m. A bill has been introduced in Congress to
                            prohibit all exports from this country except under rules and
                            regulations made by the Government but, except as to such precautions as
                            may be necessary to guard against trading with the enemy directly or
                            indirectly, it is not intended that this measure should produce
                            burdensome restrictions upon or interruptions in our commerce with
                            neutral countries. Notwithstanding that the matter is inchoate at the
                            moment and dependent upon action by Congress, you nevertheless should
                            take occasion to allay public alarm relative to its injurious effects on
                            Swiss commerce, if the measure indicated should be adopted. The
                            Department will consider authorizing some such statement as you suggest
                            if the bill now before Congress is enacted.</p>

                                    to Allies. Switzerland will not send to Central powers more than
                                    three-quarters of the mean export of butter and cheese to those
                                    countries for the years 1911 to 1913. If Italy does not fulfill
                                    her part of this agreement concerning oil cakes, agreement is
                                    void. Switzerland is to recompense Italy with additional
                                    quantities of wood and Italy must send five wagons of sulphate
                                    of copper.</p>

                        <p>2295. The following memorandum, dated May 17, has been handed to the
                            Department by the British Embassy: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>Questions connected with silk exports are about to be discussed
                                    by an inter-Allied conference which is to meet in Paris June
                                        5.<note n="1" xml:id="d283fn1">The original memorandum
                                        suggested Rome as an alternative to Paris and set the date
                                        at “about May 25” (File No. 600.001/139). According to a
                                        notation on the telegram, the memorandum itself could not be
                                        found at the time the telegram was dictated, and the version
                                        here given was then received orally from the British
                                        Embassy.</note> Among these questions is the problem of
                                    Italian thrown silk, which is still allowed to go free through
                                    Switzerland to Germany.</p>
                                <p>The reluctance of the Italians to ruin their largest industry is
                                    the main difficulty, but it is possible that this could be
                                    solved if compensating markets were found. It has been suggested
                                    that the United States might cooperate in finding a solution as
                                    they are the world’s largest silk consumers. The products of the
                                    Milan industry have some military importance, but the first
                                    consideration is, that while Italian silks pour through
                                    Switzerland it is absurd to detain silk exports to Scandinavia
                                    and Holland.</p>
                                <p>Would the United States Government be willing to instruct their
                                    representative at Paris to take part in the conference?</p>

                            of foodstuffs to neutrals. I have made an extensive and independent
                            investigation of the general question of importations in Switzerland and
                            submit the following summary.</p>
                        <p>In 1914 before outbreak of hostilities Switzerland entered into
                            agreements with France and Germany whereby Switzerland was to receive
                            cereals through intermediary of France and coal through <pb n="1163"
                                xml:id="pg_1163" facs="0409"/>intermediary of Germany without
                            compensation. Allies have fulfilled their agreement while Germany has
                            demanded compensations for coal alleging that agreement applied only to
                            transit through their country and that they were not obligated to
                            produce and ship commodities. Swiss Federal Council gave its adherence
                            to this interpretation in its reply to the Allies November 17 last.<note
                                n="1" xml:id="d284fn1">Not printed.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Swiss Society Surveillance is Swiss corporation established with consent
                            of Federal Council for the sake of preventing export to Central powers
                            of all goods which are either produced by Allies or shipped through them
                            and cooperates with Federal authorities for this work. The only goods of
                            above category permitted to be shipped to Central powers are certain
                            ingredients which enter in proportion less than 5 per cent value in the
                            manufacture of certain articles which can not be used for warlike
                            purposes. Switzerland has been free to ship where she will the produce
                            of her own land. The exportation to Central powers of articles produced
                            in Switzerland of similar character to those which they import has been
                            restricted but not stopped by reducing the ration per [<hi rend="italic"
                                >for</hi>] articles which Swiss may receive through Allied
                            countries. Switzerland has agreed to limit its shipments of its own
                            produce (see my 938, May 22, 9 a.m.) in certain articles notably milk,
                            cheese, butter as compensation for certain acts on Allies’ part. Latter
                            two articles however are not important since quantity at home so limited
                            she does not wish to export.</p>
                        <p>Both British and French have unofficial and official agents near frontier
                            and their reports agree with those of our consular officers that
                            contraband in goods imported under Swiss Society Surveillance guarantees
                            is sent across frontier but that it is impossible to say in what
                            quantities. Even with its utmost endeavors it would be impossible for
                            Federal Government to prevent smuggling because of the excessive profits
                            that the Germans offer, because of the amount of bribery they practice,
                            because the people in that portion of Swiss territory are thoroughly
                            pro-German in sympathies and because in some portions of the frontier
                            there is only an imaginary line which it is impossible adequately to
                            control even with the help of the military who have been called upon to
                            assist. Allied Governments endeavor to make rations of various
                            commodities small enough so that Switzerland will feel the pinch and use
                            utmost endeavors to prevent exportation.</p>
                        <p>For the foodstuffs which Switzerland exported to the Central powers in
                            1916 the only food she received in any quantity in return <pb n="1164"
                                xml:id="pg_1164" facs="0410"/>was potatoes, somewhat under 59,000
                            tons, much of which was of inferior quality, I am informed, and unfit
                            for human food.</p>
                        <p>Germany has recently endeavored to prevent exportation to Allies of all
                            goods manufactured from German raw materials or with assistance of
                            German coal and Allies have retaliated by providing that in manufacture
                            of articles for Germany no oil supplied by Allies may be consumed nor
                            may any machines be used imported subsequent to August 1, 1914. The
                            preceding question is still in state of negotiations.</p>
                        <p>I understand that Allies’ Legations here are about to urge their
                            Governments to take measures with Department of State to ask latter to
                            endeavor to negotiate a convention with Switzerland whereby we agree to
                            provision this country as well as [possible] after the needs of the
                            Allies have been cared for in return for Switzerland’s agreement to the
                            doctrine of similar articles; that is to say, Switzerland will not
                            export any article to Central powers of which she imports quantities
                            from or through Allies. This should not only apply to identic articles
                            but to [articles] of same general class; for example, Switzerland’s
                            exportations to Germany of certain class of leather goods are important.
                            These goods are of leather of home production but Switzerland imports
                            considerable quantities of leather through Allies. [In] confidential
                            list of exports leather is the article of greatest importance in this
                            category. It is suggested that these negotiations be inaugurated about
                            July 1, since a German-Swiss agreement expires on July 31, and the fact
                            of American demands independent of Allies would have salutary effect in
                            forcing Swiss to adopt a resolute attitude to resist Germany’s further
                            exactions. I will send further details on this point when I have the
                            text of the recommendations of the Legations to their Governments.</p>
                        <p>As the Department already knows the only articles from Germany which
                            Switzerland can not do without are coal and iron, especially coal, of
                            which they received from the Central powers in 1916 a quantity of
                            3,143,000 tons. If the Allies or ourselves were in a position to deliver
                            a reasonable proportion of this quantity we could justly demand as
                            compensation for our shipments a complete stoppage of traffic with
                            Germany, shutting out what food the latter receives from Switzerland,
                            shut off even more important shipments of electrical machines which are
                            manufactured in Switzerland from commodities supplied by Germans, and
                            align Switzerland completely with the Allied group in economic
                            questions. In this connection I might add that Switzerland’s most
                            profitable trade with Germany has already received a serious blow
                            through Germany’s prohibition of the import of articles of luxury (only
                            18,000,000 francs may be imported in the three months’ duration of
                            present agreement) in spite of commercial <pb n="1165" xml:id="pg_1165"
                                facs="0411"/>treaty with Swiss Government guaranteeing import. My
                            telegram No. 832, April 25, 5 p.m., explains how Germany demands
                            shipment of cattle as compelling [omission].</p>
                        <p>Germany has contracted for an electrically wired fence some kilo-meters
                            back of her frontiers from Sweden [<hi rend="italic">Switzerland</hi>]
                            and the Swiss claim they must feed the population within the fenced
                            district since they have no communication with rest of Germany. British
                            Minister is ready to make representations to Swiss concerning this and
                            demand that Swiss Society Surveillance material be not sent into Germany
                            on this excuse and that Germany must feed her own people. French
                            Ambassador has asked for permission to make joint representations with
                            British and they have suggested that I follow up their action with an
                            informal conversation with Minister for Foreign Affairs suggesting that
                            while the question of food shipments is acute in the United States it
                            would make a bad impression to refuse this demand of the Allies. I shall
                            follow such a course unless the Department instructs me to the
                            contrary.</p>
                        <p>The question of fodder is becoming more difficult and it seems highly
                            probable that cattle will be offered for sale to the Allies (see my 832
                            and 938). I therefore respectfully request that Department will consider
                            advisability of following plan suggested in my No. 832.</p>
                        <p>France is allowing transit through her territory without compensation
                            because of her agreement with Switzerland. Germany is demanding
                            compensations other than money for her shipments in spite of understood
                            agreement. I can see no reason why America with no agreement should not
                            demand a <hi rend="italic">quid pro quo</hi> which will give our cause
                            an advantage when we are supplying the most essential commodities of
                            all.</p>

                            note of May 7, 1917, relative to a recent press announcement that this
                            Government intends to establish a strict scrutiny of shipments destined
                            for Switzerland, I have the honor to inform you that there is about to
                            be passed by Congress a measure which, when introduced, contemplates,
                            for the public safety and the interest of the Allies, the complete
                            control by the Government of all exports from the United States under
                            rules and regulations by or under the authority of the President.</p>
                        <p>The extent to which this control should go and the cooperation of the
                            Allies in its enforcement have been tentatively discussed by members <pb

                            of the British and French missions. I agree with your Government that a
                            representative of the United States could advantageously be a member of
                            the International Commission of Contingents and I shall take steps to
                            have such a representative appointed if there appears no objection to
                            that course when the present conferences are finished and the proposed
                            measure has become a law.</p>

                        <p>2160. Your 2295, May 29. Complying with your instructions to have the
                            Embassy represented at the silk conference, I asked Mr. <persName
                                corresp="frus1917Supp02v01#p_BGTH1">Bliss</persName> and Mr.
                                <persName>Veditz</persName>, commercial attaché, to attend the
                            sessions of yesterday and today. They will continue for a day or two
                            longer.</p>
                        <p>It appears that certain varieties of Italian silks whose export is only
                            permitted to Italy [<hi rend="italic">Switzerland?</hi>] are sent to
                            Germany and are there used for important military purposes. The
                            necessity for a drastic restriction of the exportation of Italian silk
                            into Germany is further emphasized by the fact that on account of the
                            increasing scarcity of cotton Germany has found it necessary to
                            substitute silk therefor in a number of forms of important military
                            operations; that the Allied Governments, particularly French, British
                            and Italian, contemplate further restrictions concerning exports of
                            these silks to Switzerland. Such restrictions, however, are likely to
                            produce disastrous effects upon this important Italian industry, hence
                            the Italian Government asks some sort of compensation for such further
                            restrictions. The conference, upon the suggestion of Mr.
                                <persName>Clémentel</persName>, French Minister of Commerce and Mr.
                                <persName corresp="frus1917Supp02v01#p_CD1">Cochin</persName>,
                            Undersecretary of State for the Blockade, proposes instituting at

                            Turin and Milan, under supervision of representatives of British,
                            French, Italian and American Governments, a bureau undertaking to
                            purchase certain standard grades of Italian silks at a price of 90
                            francs per kilogram for so-called standard qualities of Milan and Turin
                            organzine silks and a proportionate scale for other staple grades. It is
                            further proposed that silks thus purchased shall not be sold under 100
                            francs per kilo for the basic quality before April 30, 1918. It is
                            estimated that the maximum possible purchases under arrangement cannot
                            exceed 1,000,000 or 1,500,000 kilos, a value of 90,000,000 to
                            135,000,000 <pb n="1167" xml:id="pg_1167" facs="0413"/>francs; that
                            European banks will loan upon warrants up to three-fourths of this
                            value. The possible maximum losses would therefore be for the three
                            guaranteeing Governments about 30,000,000 francs which it is proposed to
                            divide equally in case of loss between the French, British and American
                            Governments. In case of profits these would be shared by the above
                            Governments as proposed.</p>
                        <p>Since the Chamber of Commerce at <persName
                                corresp="frus1917Supp02v01#p_PFL1">Lyon</persName> which will have
                            charge of directing the operations, legally has no funds for this
                            purpose and the initial operations will require a working capital it is
                            estimated that each guaranteeing Government should make available the
                            sum of 10,000,000 francs. Tomorrow’s meeting has arranged to ratify
                            kinds of silk and the quantities thereof whose exportation from Italy to
                            Switzerland will still be permitted. Since it is assumed that the United
                            States annually purchases over 12,000,000 kilos of silks, it has been
                            suggested that possibly the United States could devise means of
                            absorbing a considerable portion of the Italian output which it is
                            proposed to cut off from Switzerland. It is proposed to subject the
                            whole organization and its operation to the control of representatives
                            of the four Governments although actual commercial operations are
                            intrusted to the <persName corresp="frus1917Supp02v01#p_PFL1"
                                >Lyon</persName> Chamber of Commerce and the silk associations of
                            Milan and Turin and the French Chambers of Commerce at Turin and Milan.
                            The cost of the organization for personnel is estimated at a maximum of
                            30,000 francs per annum, the traveling expenses of each representative
                            to be borne by the organization. The representatives of the Allied
                            Governments are desirous of learning the decision, at as early a date as
                            possible, of the American Government in regard to the proposal already
                            made at the sittings of yesterday and today, especially as the sale of
                            cocoons takes place shortly and it will be necessary to put into effect
                            without delay the agreement about to be reached at this conference.</p>
                        <p>In principle the proposal outlined above is acceptable to the
                            representatives of the three Governments. I will report to-morrow or the
                            next day the result of the deliberations of the next two meetings which
                            it is contemplated will terminate the conference.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Secretary of State</hi>: As I had the honor
                            orally to state at your Department, the régime established in
                            Switzerland with a view to preventing supplies from reaching the enemy
                            through that country has, all in all, yielded important results. These
                            were brought about in particular by the undertakings subscribed to by
                            Switzerland which restrict her liberty to export to the Central Empires:
                            Among these are the convention relative to the Swiss Society of
                            Surveillance for imported products, the fixed quota of imports taking
                            into account the national production and the recent arrangement relative
                            to agricultural products.</p>
                        <p>It seems, however, in the opinion of my Government that these measures
                            could be, with advantage, made more effective if the Government of the
                            United States would join us in asking Switzerland to confirm in a final
                            manner the revocable undertakings it has already entered into in the
                            matter of letting no merchandise similar to that imported through the
                            S.S.S. be reexported to the countries at war with the Allies. This would
                            merely be asking Switzerland to confirm a state of affairs already
                            accepted in regard to that class of products.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, certain exports against which the Entente has all
                            along protested, such as that of sausage made of Swiss pork, fats of
                            Swiss origin, might be stopped by new regulations without, as it seems,
                            involving any perceptibly awkward consequence to the Helvetic
                            Confederation in its exchange policy with Germany.</p>
                        <p>I venture in compliance with instructions received to commend these
                            suggestions to Your Excellency’s attention and should be much obliged to
                            you if you would let me know whether you have, as my Government hopes,
                            found it possible to take them into consideration.</p>

                            and silk goods destined for the enemy Empires, have, at the termination
                            of the conferences held June 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9, 1917, recommended to
                            their Governments the following resolutions:</p>
                        <p>I. The Allied Governments will prohibit the exportation of articles
                            comprised in the general designation of silks and silk goods that are
                            not now affected by any measure of this sort, which is notably the case
                            as regards worked or thrown silks, including tussore silks.</p>
                        <p>This prohibition does not apply to shipments from Allied countries to
                            Allied countries, nor to exports destined for Spain and neutral
                            transatlantic states for which a general exception is granted. It will
                            apply only to neutral countries bordering upon enemy states or situated
                            in the north of Europe.</p>
                        <p>This prohibition will take effect on and after June 25, 1917.</p>
                        <p>II. The prohibition of the exportation of thrown and reeled silks being
                            liable to work injury to the principal export trade of Italy, the
                            contracting Governments adopt the system suggested jointly by the French
                            and Italian Ministers of Commerce and Industry which consists in fixing
                            for such silks a minimum price, upon the basis of which, pending the
                            duration of the prohibitive measures, an inter-Allied purchasing bureau
                            would become the buyer of these goods, thus preventing a decline in the
                            quotation below this limit.</p>
                        <p>This operation would be conducted at the expense and risk of France,
                            America and Great Britain, the necessary advances of funds being shared
                            equally among these three states, as well as any possible losses when
                            the silk is resold. In case of any profit, one-fourth each of the total
                            amount will be allotted to France, Great Britain and America, the last
                            fourth being reserved for Italy, this distribution being justified in
                            view of the sacrifices accepted by Italy and in spite of the fact that
                            she takes no part in the advance of funds nor in possible losses.</p>

                        <p>XII. Pursuant to the foregoing measures, article 10, paragraph C, No. 2
                            of the interior regulations of the S.S.S. shall be revised.</p>
                        <p>The Allied Governments will endeavor to obtain from the Swiss Federal
                            Government the following amendment to the present text:</p>

                            clear that the fact that the Allied Governments have concluded an
                            agreement with the Swiss Government is not to be construed as indicating
                            that the Allied Governments are content that the Swiss Government should
                            supply the enemy with produce and livestock, etc, left free under such
                            agreements.</p>
                        <p>His Majesty’s Government also wish to make it clear that while in
                            previous communications they have not suggested any particular action by
                            the Government of the United States in regard to Swiss exports to
                            Germany, they do not wish to be understood to recommend that the United
                            States should be content with the situation as it stands. Indeed it is
                            obvious that the Allied Governments would welcome any arrangements by
                            which the export of Swiss native produce to the enemy could be curtailed
                            and if the United States Government has any proposals to make with this
                            end in view, His Majesty’s Government would be very glad to consider
                            them.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Secretary of State</hi>: My Government informs
                            me that upon the recommendation of the International Commission on
                            Quotas that has been approved by the Allied Governments represented
                            thereon, it has been decided to set the quota of machine tools for
                            Switzerland at zero. The measure is intended to prevent the Swiss
                            factories that are working for the enemy from receiving appliances which
                            they could put to that use.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, it is important to have exceptions made in favor of
                            the factories that are working for the Allies. To accomplish this the
                            Government of the Republic suggests that the following principle be
                            adopted: No machine tools will be allowed to be exported to Switzerland
                            without a permit from the French and Italian Commissions on Exceptions;
                            these commissions furthermore would not allow the passage through the
                            territory of their respective countries except upon investigations by
                            and the recommendation of the technical departments of the Allied
                            Legations at Berne. The transit license issued by them in such cases
                            would constitute a certificate of legitimate destination which should be
                            taken into account in the exporting country. The Allied technical
                            departments at Berne would thus be relieved of any actual accountability
                            for the refusals met by some applications, which they themselves would
                            not be called upon to render.</p>
                        <p>Since nearly all machine tools come from the United States at present, I
                            am instructed to inquire of Your Excellency whether the <pb n="1174"
                                xml:id="pg_1174" facs="0420"/>Federal Government would be inclined
                            to concur in this procedure and only allow machine tools to be exported
                            to Switzerland when a transit license shall have been issued by the
                            French or Italian Commission on Exceptions, that is to say when a
                            friendly destination shall have been proved.</p>
                        <p>In emergency cases the transit license would be delivered at the American
                            Embassies at Paris or at Rome to enable them to notify by cable the
                            American customs that they should allow the machinery to go.</p>
                        <p>In asking me to formulate this request, my Government directs me to make
                            it clear that no decision will be reached with respect to such shipments
                            without a previous understanding among the Allied departments at Berne
                            and that it is only intended to utilize existing services in obtaining
                            the common goal, which is to prevent by every available means our
                            adversaries from making, through neutrals, use of the resources at the
                            command of the Allies.</p>
                        <p>I should be very thankful to Your Excellency if you would let me know at
                            your earliest convenience whether the Federal Government is, as the
                            French Government fondly hopes it is, disposed to concur in its views
                            and adopt the above-stated procedure.</p>
                        <p>Be pleased to accept [etc.]</p>

                                that of Aug. 9 except that the Swiss ration is increased. The final
                                article of the agreement of Sept. 4 provides: “The present agreement
                                is to be substituted for that of the 9th August 1917 and will go
                                into force as soon as approved by the interested Governments.” (File

                                        from the Ambassadors of the Allies at Washington the
                                        statement of the conditions by which the allowance to
                                        Switzerland had already been regulated; then they endeavored
                                        to agree as nearly as possible as to the extent of
                                        exportation and even to reduce this figure to the

                            immediately established between them and the American officials due in
                            large measure to the natural sympathy existing between two republics;
                            and as a result the conferences were conducted in a frank and friendly
                            spirit and with a full appreciation of the respective difficulties of
                            the two countries. It is hoped and believed that the problems, which
                            have vexed the two Governments, will be satisfactorily solved in a way

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: At a conference held on November 16,
                            1917, with Mr. <persName>John Beaver White</persName> and Mr.
                                <persName>Thomas L. Chadbourne</persName>, representing the War
                            Trade Board, I was informed that a cable had been received from the
                            American mission now in Europe to the effect that it is their intention
                            to transfer to Paris the negotiations heretofore carried on between the
                            War Trade Board and myself with regard to an agreement governing exports
                            to Switzerland.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to inform Your Excellency that I have communicated this
                            information to my Government and am now directed to say that the Swiss
                            Government will gladly comply with this request and take up negotiations
                            with the American mission in Europe. My Government believes that these
                            negotiations would be greatly facilitated if the members of the mission
                            designated would visit Berne so that, through personal observation, they
                            may become thoroughly familiar with the actual conditions under which
                            Switzerland is endeavoring to keep up her economic life in relation to
                            the belligerent nations and exercising the most conscientious control
                            over all imports and exports.</p>
                        <p>I, therefore, beg leave, in accordance with the instructions from my
                            Government, to request Your Excellency to ask these gentlemen to honor
                            Switzerland with their visit.</p>

                        <p>2089. Since break of Italian line, feeling in Switzerland has become
                            daily more nervous and the realization of the possibility of a sudden
                            attack by Germany is daily more widespread. As previously reported,
                            people in the Basel district are apparently convinced that Switzerland
                            will shortly be dragged into the war. Consular agent at Lausanne reports
                            that in his district people are terrified at the prospect. The consular
                            agent learned from an officer in one of the higher training schools
                            which has just been disbanded that it was drummed into the students that
                            Switzerland would be in the war within a month. Added to this is the
                            uneasiness caused by the riots in Zürich, which I have reported, and
                            possibility of similar outbursts in Geneva. There seems to be some
                            grounds for belief that these riots are provoked by German agents. I
                            have previously reported that the President spoke to me with an air of
                            utter discouragement and I now find that this atmosphere pervades the
                            Foreign Office. I have been urged both at the British Legation and by
                            the French Ambassador that no unbearable demands should be made on
                            Switzerland at the present time in view of the prevailing
                            uneasiness.</p>
                        <p>In a discussion of the general situation, the French military attaché
                            stated that since the Italian defeat he regarded intervention from
                            Germany as daily more probable although he believed that a certain time
                            must elapse before the attempt was made but that there is an extreme
                            probability that the attempt will be made before America can be an
                            effective factor in land forces. He believes that the blow will come
                            with lightning rapidity with no warning and with a force of at least
                            half a million men mobilized 100 to 150 miles back of the frontier. He
                            states that France has foreseen and laid plans against this eventuality
                            and that every precaution had been taken. What causes particular
                            uneasiness at present are the facts that five German divisions cannot be
                            located at present and are supposed to be in the Trentino, that a
                            demonstration is being made in upper Alsace which would give an excuse
                            for mobilization near the Swiss border and that it would appear
                            strategically advantageous to endeavor to smash the Italian line in the
                            Trentino coupled with a simultaneous dash for the St. Gotthard Pass in
                            order <pb n="1180" xml:id="pg_1180" facs="0426"/>to push two columns of
                            troops into the Lombardy plain behind the Allied line on the Piave or
                            Adige. He feels, and his belief is backed by the best information at my
                            disposal, that the Swiss would make a loyal effort to repel the Germans

                                rend="italic">aide-mémoire:</hi>
                            <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>Federal Council has received from its Minister at Washington
                                    alarming news concerning the revictualment of Switzerland in
                                    wheat. According to despatch the Government of the United States
                                    would not be able for several reasons, specifically because of
                                    shortage of provisions, to decide upon the authorization of
                                    exportation of wheat destined for Switzerland.</p>
                                <pb n="1181" xml:id="pg_1181" facs="0427"/>
                                <p>Since last July Switzerland has not been able to make purchases
                                    of wheat and for several months transportation of this
                                    merchandise from the United States to Cette has been
                                    interrupted. All the stocks which were in this port have entered
                                    Switzerland. The country continues to live entirely on the
                                    modest stocks that it already has in reserve and on the scanty
                                    provisions that the home crop furnishes. Without new importation
                                    of wheat from the United States all Swiss provisions will be
                                    exhausted in the coming spring and the country will be in a very
                                    critical condition.</p>
                                <p>Persuaded that the Government of the United States which several
                                    times already has shown its friendliness to Switzerland, will
                                    relieve Switzerland from the grave situation which menaces it,
                                    the Federal Council has charged its Minister at Washington to
                                    beg the American Government to authorize the exportation of
                                    240,000 tons of wheat, an extremely modest quantity which would
                                    not sensibly reduce the provisioning of the United States and
                                    its Allies.</p>
                                <p>The Swiss Ministry has also informed the Federal Council that in
                                    accordance with the declaration of the American Government,
                                    Switzerland could in the future appeal especially to the
                                    Argentine crop to cover its needs in wheat but the Argentine
                                    purchases are extremely difficult. The length of the double trip
                                    cuts in half the already insufficient tonnage which is at our
                                    disposition, besides the transportation of Argentine wheat is
                                    extremely problematical. The Federal Council will be very
                                    grateful to the Legation of the United States at Berne to be
                                    kind enough to intervene with its Government and point out the
                                    unhappy situation in Switzerland. Without the aid of the
                                    American Government this situation would be aggravated rapidly
                                    and would make a profound impression on the Swiss population
                                    which has always counted on shipments from the United
                                    States.</p>

                        <p>The President stated that the bread ration for December would be 225
                            grammes and for January 200 grammes. I have previously reported that
                            disturbances had occurred in Zurich and were threatened in Geneva. The
                            continued reduction of the bread ration will doubtless increase these
                            difficulties and bring about a decided reaction of sentiment against the
                            United States and the general cause of the Entente. Please see my No.
                            2089 of November 22, 10 a.m. Department will note that Allied
                            representatives here are anxious that Switzerland should not be pressed
                            too hard in these conditions. The possibility must be considered of
                            Germany offering necessary quantities of food as exchange for use of St.
                            Gotthard. If food were unobtainable elsewhere this would place Federal
                            Council in a most difficult situation.</p>
                        <p>In view of the above it would seem highly desirable that small quantities
                            at least of wheat be authorized for exportation pending conclusion of
                            negotiations since a small quantity will at least be definite evidence
                            of good will of the United States and serve to calm popular
                            uneasiness.</p>

                        <p>Our wheat situation is such that we simply cannot supply Switzerland. We

                            than we contemplated. It is absolutely critical that they should draw
                            their grain supplies except corn from India, Australia and the Argentine
                            and that no supplies should be pledged to other neutrals from North

                                thus elsewhere obtained shall be subtracted from the quantities set

                                than 5 per cent of the monthly tonnage available for Switzerland in
                                United States ports.</p>
                            <p>6. In the event the Swiss Government shall be unable to secure
                                adequate ocean tonnage facilities to transport her supplies from
                                this country, such aid shall be extended in securing additional
                                tonnage facilities of neutral ownership as may be possible,
                                consistent with the tonnage requirements of the United States and
                                Allied Governments.</p>

                            <p>7. The Swiss Government recognizes that it is undesirable that
                                vessels under Swiss charter should proceed in ballast or only
                                partially loaded to a United States port. Spanish vessels chartered
                                by the Swiss Government to carry cargoes to France destined for the
                                Swiss Government shall, when westward bound,<note n="1"

                                acceptable cargo is available, such other cargo may be substituted.
                                The Swiss Government will co-operate in every way that lies within
                                its power in order that all vessels inward bound to the United
                                States shall carry full cargo.</p>
                            <p>8. It is further expressly stipulated that any articles, commodities,
                                material or substances which may be in transit, or which may have
                                arrived at any port in France from the United States, shall not
                                until such time as this memorandum shall finally become effective,
                                pass beyond such French ports in the course of transportation to
                                Switzerland. Any export license in the meantime issued for such
                                above-mentioned articles, commodities, material or substances from
                                the United States, whether so<note n="2" xml:id="d314fn5">Original

                                the conditions expressed in this paragraph. Cargoes licensed from
                                the first day of October, 1917, and until this agreement becomes
                                effective, shall provisorily remain in the custody of the French
                                Government or its representatives until released by them for final

                            <p>9. That the importation into Switzerland of the articles,
                                commodities, material, and substances herein mentioned is for

                                internal requirements of Switzerland, with due regard to the
                                importation into Switzerland from other countries than the United
                                States of articles, commodities, material, and substances capable of

                                Revictualling of the Inter-Allied Conference, Switzerland is to
                                receive a guaranteed allotment of 240,000 tons of cereal
                                bread-stuffs (¾ to ⅔s of which to consist of wheat).</p>
                            <p>This allotment is, if possible, to be shipped to the port of Cette
                                and to be supplied under the same conditions as the cereal
                                bread-stuff supplied to the Allies. These supplies are to be
                                transported on Allied ships or on ships supplied to Switzerland by
                                the Allies for this purpose, subject to an arrangement made or to be

                                Executive. This stipulation is not to be considered as in any way

                                agrees to charter neutral ships for Swiss services through the
                                intermediary of the International Chartering Executive.</p>

                                allotment of 240,000 tons of cereal bread-stuff which may consist of
                                other than wheat, is not to be deducted from the allotments above

                            <p>I have taken note of the text of the “memorandum between the War
                                Trade Board and the Swiss Government relating to exports from the
                                United States to destinations in Switzerland which must be
                                authorized by the said War Trade Board.”</p>
                            <p>The text of this document as it has been established in the
                                conferences which have lately taken place, first among the Allied
                                delegates, and later with the Swiss delegates, is in complete
                                harmony with the various existing arrangements with Switzerland and
                                calls for no remarks from me.</p>
                            <p>I have, therefore, the honor of informing you that I give it the
                                formal approval of the French Government, as is required in the last
                                paragraph of Section III of this agreement.</p>
                            <p>I congratulate myself heartily on having been able thus to take part
                                in the conclusion of an arrangement which marks so happily the
                                participation of the United States in the economic negotiations made
                                necessary by present circumstances.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In confirmation of the statement made by
                            me in the conversation I had with Your Excellency yesterday, I now have
                            the honor to give official notice of the formal acceptance by my
                            Government of the memorandum agreed upon by the chairman of the War
                            Trade Board, Mr. <persName corresp="frus1917Supp02v01#p_MVC1">Vance
                                McCormick</persName>, and the delegates of the Government of
                            Switzerland, governing the importation of American products into
                            Switzerland.</p>
                        <p>In this connection, I am especially directed by my Government to convey
                            its highest appreciation of this further evidence on the part of Your
                            Excellency’s Government of the friendship the United States has always
                            shown to my country.</p>
                        <p>It is needless to assure Your Excellency that the Swiss Government shall
                            not fail to adhere scrupulously to the obligations it has assumed under
                            this agreement which is of such vital importance to the solution of her
                            food problems. Switzerland feels confident that the same mutual friendly
                            spirit which marked the negotiations will be maintained in carrying out
                            its provisions.</p>

                            met in Paris in order to determine the putting into force of the
                            agreement of June 9, 1917, relative to silks and silk goods:</p>
                        <p>1. They took note of the subsequent decision of the Italian Government to
                            participate in the operation provided for in Article II of the
                            above-mentioned agreement by making payment of a quota equal to that of
                            the other Allied Governments who signed the agreement.</p>
                        <p>The quotas to be paid, the expenses and risks of the operation will thus
                            be divided into four parts and no longer into three parts between the
                            interested states.</p>
                        <p>2. They also took note of the fact that as a consequence of the
                            negotiations conducted between the French and Italian Governments and
                            the intervention of technical delegates from both parties, <pb n="1198"

                        <p>3. In accordance with the provisions of Article IX of the agreement of
                            June 9, 1917, the American, British, French and Italian Governments will

                            compose a committee which will be entrusted with the duty of assuring
                            the liaison between the bureau at Lyons and the interested
                            Governments.</p>
                        <p>This committee, which will itself fix the practical conditions of its
                            working, will meet either at Lyons or at Paris as often as one of the

                        <p>4. The delegates promised to submit as soon as possible to the

                                            January 8, the British Government notified the French of
                                            its adhesion to the protocol of December 17, 1917; that
                                            adhesion of the Italian Government is implied by the
                                            evidences that it subscribed on April 17, to deposit its
                                            quota of 2,500,000; furthermore the French competent

                        <p>The Spanish Ambassador called and said he had seen some statements in the
                            papers in regard to this Government’s embargoing wheat and coal to
                            neutrals. I told him that nothing had been settled by this Government;
                            as yet the matter was being considered and discussed. I told him for his
                            confidential information that while we had come to no conclusion it was
                            being urged that this Government use the embargo to control the export
                            of necessities, not to embargo the neutrals further than was necessary
                            for our own protection, that we were considering the proposition of
                            asking certain neutrals to get their wheat for instance from Australia
                            so the neutral shipping could be used and relieve shipping of the
                            belligerents. I said that it had been suggested that this country take
                            over the supply of coal to South America and Spain, but of course if
                            this were done we would be most careful not to interfere with any
                            reciprocal arrangements existing with the European belligerents. That is
                            to say, if any neutral was giving anything to Great Britain in exchange
                            for coal it would be necessary that that agreement be carried out then
                            we would [not?] supply the coal, otherwise we would be in a position of
                            supplying neutrals and depriving our allies of necessary supplies. He
                            thought it was all very reasonable and said he could quite see why this
                            Government would refuse to give supplies to neutrals if as the result of
                            these supplies being sent to neutrals they would be relieved of
                            arrangements now existing with Great Britain and France.</p>

                        <p>
                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: You will remember that at
                            our conference yesterday we touched on the question of the difficulties
                            which Spain <pb n="1200" xml:id="pg_1200" facs="0446"/>was making in
                            regard to the export of iron ore to Great Britain and of the assistance
                            which the United States Government could render us in inducing the
                            Spanish Government to take a more friendly attitude. It may be useful if
                            I summarize the position in writing.</p>
                        <p>Until the declaration of the German submarine blockade, Spanish ships
                            brought iron ore to the United Kingdom and took back coal. They have
                            since been taken out of this trade and have been put into safer trades
                            such as that of carrying coal from the United States. In order to obtain
                            Spanish ore we had, therefore, to use Allied ships, diverting them from
                            other essential work. They were sent with coal to France and Italy and
                            brought back ore on their homeward voyage. Spain then, however, refused
                            to allow our ships to load ore unless they brought coal for her and
                            relied on her power to obtain coal from the United States in the event
                            of our refusing. As the need of coal for France and Italy is urgent not
                            only for ordinary civil purposes but also for munitions work, we could
                            not take colliers from the French and Italian trade without very
                            seriously prejudicing our belligerent position.</p>
                        <p>An agreement known as the Cortina agreement has, indeed, been signed with
                            the Spanish Government. Its terms are, briefly, as follows: <list>
                                <item>Article 1. The British Government undertake to licence 150,000
                                    tons of coal, including coke and patent fuel, per month to
                                    Spain, with a possible increase of 30,000 tons a month if Allied
                                    interests permit.</item>
                                <item>Art. 2. The Spanish Government undertake to allow the British
                                    Government or British firms to time-charter 400,000 tons dead
                                    weight of Spanish shipping. If this total amount is not
                                    time-chartered the obligations of the British Government under
                                    article 1 are proportionately reduced.</item>
                                <item>Art. 3. The Spanish Government undertake not to prohibit or
                                    hinder or place duty on the export of iron ore, and to allow the
                                    export of pyrites and lead under the conditions at present in
                                    force.</item>
                                <item>Art. 4. The Spanish Government will not hinder the acquisition
                                    on voyage or time-charter by the British Government or British
                                    interests of Spanish vessels for trade between Spain and the
                                    United Kingdom except for 100,000 tons retained for Spanish use.
                                    The British Government will allow the chartering of other
                                    neutral vessels to trade between Spain and the United Kingdom,
                                    France and Italy on certain conditions.</item>
                                <item>Art. 5 grants an option of purchase of Spanish vessels laid up
                                    in British ports from February 7.</item>
                                <item>Art. 6. The British Government agree to the purchase by the
                                    Spanish Government or firms of the steamships <hi rend="italic"
                                        >Brasilian</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Frankenwald</hi> for
                                    the Spanish coasting trade during the war. Retransfer to any
                                    third party can only take place with the consent of the British
                                    Government.</item>
                                <item>Arts. 7, 8, 9, and 10 deal with the importation into Great
                                    Britain from Spain of potatoes, forage, oranges and wine.</item>
                                <pb n="1201" xml:id="pg_1201" facs="0447"/>
                                <item>Art. 11 states that no licences can be given at present for
                                    the export of sulphate of ammonia to Spain but future urgent
                                    needs of Spain will be borne in mind.</item>
                                <item>Art. 12. Subject to home requirements the British Government
                                    will licence 300 tons of tin plates a month and will agree to
                                    the direct importation into Spain from the United States of a
                                    further quantity by vessels of the Compania Transatlántica. In
                                    return the Spanish Government will place no difficulties in the
                                    way of exportation to the United Kingdom and her allies.</item>
                                <item>Art. 13. Subject to home requirements and those of the Allies
                                    the British Government will allow 120 tons a month of
                                    ferro-manganese to Spain and will increase this quantity if the
                                    Spanish Government show that the export of steel to the United
                                    Kingdom, France and Italy is above the average.</item>
                                <item>Art. 14 is general and states that each Government will do
                                    their best to provide the requirements of the other.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>The agreement was signed by both parties but is subject to ratification.
                            So far the Spanish Government have delayed ratification owing, it is
                            thought, to pro-German opposition and the British Government doubt, in
                            fact, whether it will ever take place. The Spanish Government state that
                            the agreement must be submitted to the Cortes.</p>
                        <p>The position has now become even more serious for, according to a Reuter
                            message from Madrid, the Spanish Government have issued a prohibition of
                            the export of metals. This would most gravely affect the Ministry of
                            Munitions particularly with regard to lead and copper which are urgently
                            required from Spain. Even if iron ore and pyrites are not included in
                            the prohibition, the position would still be one of gravity.</p>
                        <p>The United States Government will readily understand that the regular
                            supply of Spanish iron ore is absolutely vital to the conduct of the war
                            and that it is, therefore, essential that the Cortina agreement should
                            be put into force without delay or, at any rate, that strong pressure
                            should be brought on the Spanish Government if further difficulties are
                            placed in the way of the export of iron ore and pyrites to the United
                            Kingdom and France.</p>
                        <p>In these circumstances the British Government would very greatly
                            appreciate it if the United States Government would intimate to the
                            Spanish Government, in any manner that seem proper to them, that they
                            are entirely in accord with the views of the British Government with
                            whom, they understand, an arrangement has been made by which British
                            coal can be supplied to Spain on certain conditions. It might be pointed
                            out that in view of this and of the extreme importance to the Allies of
                            economizing tonnage, the United States do not see their way to allowing
                            the export of coal to Spain, now that ample provision has been made for
                            the necessary supplies to be obtained from the United Kingdom which
                            entails a much <pb n="1202" xml:id="pg_1202" facs="0448"/>shorter sea
                            voyage. It might, perhaps, also be hinted that other essential supplies
                            from the United States would be dependent on a satisfactory attitude of
                            the Spanish Government in regard to the shipment of iron ore and pyrites
                            to Great Britain.</p>
                        <p>I need not emphasize the point that the support of the United States
                            Government in this matter is of the first importance, and I should like
                            to assure you that if the United States Government could see their way
                            to take action on the above lines, it would be a source of extreme
                            gratification to the British Government.</p>

                        <p>481. Department advised by British commission now here that the Spanish
                            Government may be inclined to refuse to Great Britain iron ore which is
                            greatly needed for the manufacture of munitions, since Spain believes
                            she no longer needs to obtain coal from Great Britain because she can
                            obtain it from the United States. You may, at an opportune moment, say
                            to the Foreign Minister that the recent reports of Spanish attempts to
                            purchase coal in the United States make it important to bring to his
                            notice the fact that American coal is being increasingly needed owing to
                            the exigencies of war, not only in the United States, but for the supply
                            of our co-belligerents, and that it may be necessary, therefore, for
                            this Government to restrict or prohibit the exportation of coal to
                            neutrals. Add that this advance notice is given in order that the
                            Spanish Government may be fully cognizant of the situation, and may
                            understand the nature of the prohibition should it be declared. Add also
                            that if Spain is willing to continue to export iron ore to Great Britain
                            as heretofore, so as to relieve as much as possible the large
                            exportations of iron and iron <pb n="1203" xml:id="pg_1203" facs="0449"
                            />products, including tubing, from the United States to Great Britain
                            and her allies it may be possible to facilitate the exportation of
                            limited amounts of coal to Spain.</p>
                        <p>Cooperate fully and informally with the British Ambassador in this matter
                            and report by cable.</p>
                        <p>For your own information. The British commission here believe that the
                            Spanish Government is inimical to Great Britain and is likely to
                            embarrass her by curtailing her supply of iron ore, which is essential
                            to her munitions factories, and to impose other restrictions. The United
                            States is not desirous of assisting Spain to obtain coal here while her
                            refusal to furnish ore to Great Britain will make a larger demand upon
                            American iron and iron products, which are much needed here. Reference
                            is made to tubing because it is understood that Spanish buyers are
                            negotiating for large purchases of that material in the United States at
                            the present time.</p>

                        <p>572. Substance of Department’s 481, May 22, 6 p.m., communicated to
                            Minister of State as directed. Have also conferred with British
                            Ambassador. He seemed optimistic as to probability of agreement being
                            reached between Spanish and British Governments allowing export of iron
                            from Spain and certain quantities of coal from England per month.
                            Minister of State also appeared hopeful that British and Spanish
                            Governments would come to satisfactory understanding regarding iron and
                            coal situation. It has been respectfully suggested however that pending
                            a formal agreement between these two countries on the subject no
                            definite agreement should be made whereby Spain may be assured regular

                            </hi>: May I write you a word about the pyrites situation which I know
                            is causing Mr. <persName corresp="frus1917Supp02v01#p_PFL1"
                                >Polk</persName> some anxiety in connection with the question of
                            Spain and shipments of coal to that country.</p>
                        <p>We had yesterday a conference at the Department of Commerce, where I
                            think all the interested parties were present. You will doubtless hear
                            the results of that conference from Doctor <persName
                                corresp="frus1917Supp02v01#p_PEE1">Pratt</persName>,<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d324fn1">
                                <persName corresp="frus1917Supp02v01#p_PEE1">Edward E.
                                    Pratt</persName>, Chief, Bureau of Foreign and Domestic
                                Commerce, U. S. Department of Commerce.</note> but I think I may say
                            that our discussion showed two things: first, that the present rate of
                            imports is higher than had been supposed, and secondly, that there is no
                            reason to suppose that our Ministry of Shipping cannot help you out with
                            sufficient ships for your needs in the immediate future. We have
                            already, about a fortnight ago, placed at your disposal four ships—the
                                <hi rend="italic">Clara Mennig</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                                >Armenian</hi> and two others—for this trade. Besides the ships we
                            control, there are those controlled by the French and Italian
                            Governments which can be called on in case of need to bring cargoes from
                            Huelva on the westward voyage. There is, further, a possible margin in
                            the fact that the United States appears recently to have been taking
                            much more iron ore from Spain and much less than usual from Sweden. We
                            can probably enable you to carry far more ore from Sweden, thus
                            relieving the pressure on the tonnage between this country and Spain.
                            Meanwhile, the Spanish Government is, so far as we know, placing no
                            difficulties in the way of the export of pyrites, so that that
                            Government is not in a position to offer any remedy to the situation.
                            The real remedy appears to be that we should rely on our joint coal
                            pressure, imposed silently and without threats as a measure of
                            conservation of resources, to bring Spanish tonnage speedily into the
                            Allied market, as proposed in the Cortina agreement; and that you should
                            rely, during the intervening period before this pressure becomes
                            effective, on yourselves and your allies to provide the necessary
                            tonnage to tide over your immediate needs. I feel sure we can meet the
                            situation in this way.</p>

                            Spanish pyrites are available and can be had if and when tonnage is
                            procurable} adding that Minister of Munitions has been urged to do
                            everything possible to facilitate American purchases of this material.
                            Foreign Office further states it has been informed by Ministry of

                            cargoes of pyrites to American ports and that further tonnage will be

                        <p>788. Minister for Foreign Affairs has asked that the United States
                            Government grant to Spain a credit of 500,000 tons coal to be drawn upon
                            from time to time during the next six months (he will however be glad to
                            accept much smaller credit). I responded that I <pb n="1207"
                                xml:id="pg_1207" facs="0453"/>could submit such request only upon
                            following conditions to apply to each separate permit for coal: <list>
                                <label>(1)</label>
                                <item>That the United States’ needs be supplied;</item>

                                <item>That the present favorable attitude of Spain to our
                                    cobelligerents continue, especially concerning the shipment of
                                    iron ore to England;</item>
                                <label>(4)</label>
                                <item>That any such undertaking shall be agreeable to our

                                    coal reaching the hands of parties, Spaniards or others, engaged
                                    directly or indirectly in rendering assistance to our
                                    enemies.</item>

                        </p>
                        <p>Minister of State added that he is informed Trasatlántica steamers
                            between New York and Spanish ports are encountering difficulty in
                            securing bunker coal for return voyages, as well as cargoes; that
                            Spanish Ambassador in Washington has been instructed to make
                            representations to the Department and requested the Embassy to support
                            them. I responded that rumors, though unconfirmed, had reached the
                            Embassy that the Trasatlántica Co. was very pro-German and its officers
                            engaged in unneutral acts. He stated that while it was possible that
                            certain officials were pro-German in their sympathies, yet he assured me
                            no officers were violating nor would these be permitted to violate
                            Spanish neutrality. It should be borne in mind that the present Ministry
                            in Spain is distinctly pro-Ally in its attitude as well as its
                            sentiments. I therefore respectfully suggest Department’s prompt and
                            favorable consideration of the above request of the Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs, on the following grounds: <list>
                                <label>(1)</label>
                                <item>That such understanding will facilitate interchange of
                                    commodities between Spain and England;</item>
                                <label>(2)</label>
                                <item>That it will generally improve present and future commercial
                                    relations between the United States and Spain;</item>

                        <p>797. Minister for Foreign Affairs requests that Embassy urge that Spanish
                            vessel <hi rend="italic">Bartolo</hi>, destined for Chile from Norfolk
                            with coal and Chile to Spain with nitrates, be supplied with desired
                            coal as said nitrates are necessary to insure next Spanish crop of wheat
                            and sugar. He requests also release of <hi rend="italic">Cataluña</hi>,
                            loaded since August 28 with petroleum for Pasajes, where he states that
                            the supply is now nearly exhausted. Embassy respectfully suggests that
                            such concession in regard to the first above-named ship as Department
                            may see fit to make would be of advantage here in insuring the present
                            liberal attitude of Spanish Government towards our co-belligerents,
                            facilitate shipment of iron ore and other necessary commodities, and
                            strengthen our influence with Spain. Spain now recognizes her immediate
                            dependence upon us and is most anxious for close commercial and other
                            relations. In an interview with His Majesty yesterday he so expresses
                            himself very earnestly. Furthermore concerning coal desired for <hi
                                rend="italic">Bartolo</hi>, it should be borne in mind that such
                            coal cannot reach our enemies. However regarding <hi rend="italic"
                                >Cataluña</hi> and desired release of its cargo of petrol Embassy
                            cannot recommend release without further investigation as to the
                            consignees for fear that part of such cargo might be supplied to German
                            submarine boats. Embassy requests instructions.</p>

                            matter of allowing the exportation of petroleum, I regret to say that
                            the Department is advised by the Exports Administrative Board that it is
                            unwilling at the present time to permit the exportation of petroleum to
                            Spain. The whole situation regarding exports of petroleum is under
                            investigation but at the present time it is felt that there is no means
                            whatsoever of ascertaining the destination of the petroleum and the uses
                            to which it is to be applied. The board further states that in view of
                            the submarine situation these exports can not be allowed until more data
                            and more accurate means of following up the consignments are made
                            available.</p>

                                <p>The American Government continues to refuse to give authority for

                                    serious condition will arise on account of lack of gasoline.</p>
                                <p>Also our Ambassador tells me that the American Government refuses
                                    to grant licenses to sailing ships of any country for European

                                    as among the sailing ships anchored in American ports are some
                                    Spanish ones with cargoes for this country. Only from the fact
                                    that the transmitter of this information is His Majesty’s
                                    Ambassador, could I accept this news as authentic as I should
                                    have been inclined to suppose that this report of the

                                <p>The matter is settled and although pending advice I have

                                <p>As to the mineral oil our Ambassador was told that if we allowed

                                    ships would be permitted to come with the desired oil. The

                            is very strongly of the opinion that not only are certain
                            products—particularly bulky stuff like lumber, general construction
                            material and cross ties—greatly needed from Spain but that the situation
                            there is such that this want can only be supplied with some sort of
                            reciprocal arrangement by our Government as recommended by Mr.
                                <persName>Christie</persName> in his letter. <persName

                            securing the supplies from Spain and Switzerland. As to the quantity of
                            lumber required, <persName corresp="frus1917Supp02v01#p_DLCCG1">Colonel
                                Dawes</persName> left me a memorandum from which I quote as
                            follows.</p>
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>As indicating the importance of the lifting of the embargo upon
                                cotton to Spain where the same can be used in exchange for
                                concessions as to lumber importations to France for the American
                                Expeditionary Force, I will state that the needs of the Army in
                                lumber have been estimated for six months as 165,000,000 feet. As
                                against this it is estimated that we can secure in Europe, unless we
                                have concessions from Spain and Switzerland, only about 35,000,000
                                feet. It is evident, therefore, that to supply the needs of the Army
                                the different branches of the service will have to requisition the
                                United States for 130,000,000 feet of lumber which, at the rate of
                                2,500,000 feet for a 5,000–ton ship, will require 54 ships at a ship
                                transportation cost of between fifty and one hundred dollars per
                                1,000 feet which we believe will cover the cost of any Spanish or
                                Swiss lumber delivered in France. We can not estimate as yet how
                                much lumber we can secure in Spain and Switzerland but should have
                                the lever of embargo concessions to secure all possible lumber.
                                [Lumber] is selected only as an example to indicate the importance
                                of the results which can be obtained under the reciprocity

                        <p>The ability to obtain this very necessary material from Spain would
                            obviously greatly relieve the [demands] upon the tonnage coming from
                            America, and also very much expedite its delivery. From my talks with

                            encountered in getting needed [lumber] already. An undertaking has been
                            brought about between <persName corresp="frus1917Supp02v01#p_DLCCG1"

                            best concessions possible in the shipment of materials from Spain. Being
                            on the ground and thoroughly familiar with conditions at Madrid, it
                            would seem to me that such authority would not only be desirable but
                            necessary under the circumstances.</p>

                            that Spain greatly needed them. I replied that while my Government was
                            most anxious to supply Spain with such commodities as she might need and
                            thereby continue and extend the cordial commercial relations already
                            existing yet there was great need on our own part and on the part of our
                            co-belligerents of certain of these commodities, especially cotton, coal
                            and oil, and that it might be necessary in the near future to curtail,
                            if not prohibit, such exportations. I told him that the fact that our
                            many applications for permits to export cotton thread, waste and other
                            articles from Spain to the United States, to which you had been unable
                            to secure any replies from the Spanish Government, was not conducive in
                            my judgment to the best advantage securing of such permits as he
                            desired. I begged him to permit me to say unofficially and in the most
                            friendly spirit that the apparent attitude of the Spanish Government in
                            connection with activities of German and other enemy subjects in Spain
                            and the unrestricted submarine activities in the immediate vicinity, if
                            not in Spanish waters, had not produced a good impression in my country,
                            and that in this connection I should be very glad to learn from him as
                            soon as possible, for transmission by cable to my Government, the
                            attitude of the Spanish Government in respect to the representations of
                            the Allied Embassies and ourselves concerning the interning of the crews
                            of all German merchant vessels now in Spanish waters. I concluded by
                            assuring him that I was at all times anxious to cooperate with him in
                            establishing and furthering the most cordial relations commercially and
                            otherwise between the United States and Spain.</p>
                        <p>In the absence of instructions to the contrary I shall reiterate my above
                            statement to His Majesty with whom I have asked an audience when I see
                            him and shall add that my Government has determined to use to fullest
                            extent its entire economic strength in the prosecution of this war to a
                            successful conclusion; a war which it sought earnestly to avoid and into
                            which it has now entered without ambition to secure territorial,
                            political or other gain.</p>

                            before trade could be completely reestablished. Department understood

                            Would in your opinion 30,000 bales spread over a period of several weeks
                            be undesirable? Please cable immediately what discussions you had in
                            Paris with representatives of the Allies and Army, and whether

                        <p>910. Until receipt of Department’s 769, December 1, 6 p.m., this Embassy
                            has been without information concerning the granting of licenses to
                            export cotton, oil and other commodities to Spain. During my stay in

                        <p>913. Embassy’s 910 December 3, 1 p.m. Consul General informs Embassy
                            about 88,000 bales of cotton in Spain. Embassy respectfully suggests no
                            more permits to export cotton be granted until January 1, and until
                            after further exchange of views. Embassy further respectfully suggests
                            that refusals to grant such permits be based entirely upon the ground of
                            our own needs, of our co-belligerents’, and that no ground be given for
                            the charge of retaliation on part of United States. Barcelona also
                            reports average daily consumption in Spain 1,000 bales.</p>

                                facs="0465"/>of a conference between representatives of America,
                            France and Spain, relative to purchases of the Allies from the latter
                            country. Ministry considers this of greatest urgency and has requested
                            that I bring the matter to your attention with a view to a discussion of
                            the matter to be held here between representatives of our Government and
                            France in order to reach a definite agreement and then confer with
                            Spanish delegates here. The British Government has recently signed an
                            agreement of this nature with Spain which does not in any way interfere
                            with a similar agreement which we might make. It is believed by the
                            Ministry of Blockade that the three Governments could consolidate on one
                            agreement at a later date. As the Department will readily understand the
                            object of the proposed conference is to reach a definite agreement
                            whereby through the creation of an inter-Allied bureau working under a
                            definite agreement with Spain purchases will be made on behalf of the
                            Allies without competition occurring between the latter. It is felt also
                            that such an arrangement would tend greatly to assure the stability of
                            the economic situation in Spain which at present gives rise to certain
                            apprehensions.</p>

                                >See preceding telegram.</note> Embassy made suggestions contained
                            in its 923, December 12, 11 a.m., because the Anglo-Spanish agreement
                            concerning the exchange of coal and iron ore, so important to England,
                            had just been signed, after many months of negotiations; at the personal
                            request of the King; at the request of the Prime Minister and Minister
                            of State; with the approval of the British and French Ambassadors; for
                            the express purpose of combating in advance any chances either of
                            retaliation or <pb n="1221" xml:id="pg_1221" facs="0467"/>unfriendliness
                            toward Spain; and believing that the release of some of Spain’s many
                            purchases in the United States, without changing our general policy of
                            embargo, would create a good impression here. (Special reference is here
                            made to last clause of Embassy’s 923<note n="1" xml:id="d350fn2">

                                1206</ref>.</note>). I had also explained at great length to both
                            the King and the Prime Minister and Minister of State that our embargo
                            was not a retaliatory measure but for the protection of ourselves and
                            our cobelligerents; that while we needed all these commodities,
                            especially cotton, oils, and coal, yet if the Spanish Government felt
                            that it was able to respond to the suggestion of ourselves and the
                            Allies relative to a more repressive policy toward Germans interned in
                            Spain and regarding permits to export of purchases made in Spain by
                            Allies and purchases probably to be made by our Army in France, that
                            then it might be possible for my Government to make the necessary
                            sacrifices and to permit the exportation of certain commodities desired
                            by Spain. Embassy’s course seems to have clearly demonstrated its good
                            faith and created good impression since several newspapers now hold
                            Government responsible for Spain’s failure to secure exports from United
                            States, especially cotton.</p>
                        <p>Embassy has been informed by French Embassy that arrangements between
                            United States and France looking to the purchase of supplies in Spain
                            are now being considered in Paris. France is constantly making such
                            purchases in Spain but French Ambassador is encountering great
                            difficulty in securing permission to export. Embassy was on 20th instant
                            informed of purchases here of dried beans and rice by American Army in
                            France, and at the request of purchasing agent, American Expeditionary
                            Forces, has asked Foreign Office for permission to export. However it is
                            not anticipated that desired permits will be secured unless our embargo
                            is strictly enforced in United States and Embassy instructed to
                            negotiate reciprocal exchanges thereunder directly with Foreign Office.
                            This Ministry is not friendly to the Allies or United States and no
                            concessions can be secured otherwise than upon the basis of an exchange
                            of whatever commodities respectively needed by the Allies and United
                            States and by Spain. If withholding of licenses to export from the
                            United States is discontinued, quoting threat in Department’s 796, then
                            no permits to export purchases made in Spain for American Army in France
                            can now be secured, and it is feared that such policy will materially
                            weaken cobelligerents’ efforts to secure their desired permits to
                            export. Therefore the Embassy feels that it is absolutely necessary to
                            enforce our embargo <pb n="1222" xml:id="pg_1222" facs="0468"/>(with
                            such modifications from time to time as were suggested in Embassy’s 923)
                            in order to secure supplies for ourselves and allies freely.</p>
                        <p>Replying to last paragraph, Department’s 796 under consideration, Embassy
                            is not informed as to Department’s policy or wishes in regard to our
                            securing Spanish ship tonnage, although it has general knowledge of
                            England’s desire and efforts to secure such tonnage. While in Paris I
                            discussed Spanish situation freely but informally with <persName
                                corresp="frus1917Supp02v01#p_MVC1">McCormick</persName> and his
                            associates, yet no lines were agreed upon between us; on the contrary
                                <persName corresp="frus1917Supp02v01#p_MVC1">McCormick</persName>
                            stated to me that the general situation would be carefully considered
                            and when definite conclusions as to policy were reached this Embassy
                            would be instructed from Washington. Since that time I have received
                            personal letter from <persName corresp="frus1917Supp02v01#p_MVC1"
                                >McCormick</persName> in reply to letter from this Embassy regarding
                            exchange situation here suggesting that I might get in touch with
                                <persName corresp="frus1917Supp02v01#p_COT1">Crosby</persName> of
                            Treasury Department now in London. Embassy has however taken no such
                            steps but is anxiously awaiting Department’s definite instructions.
                            Embassy is firmly of opinion that no concessions can be obtained from
                            Spanish, chiefly owing to [omission] under this Ministry except along
                            lines above indicated and as has been repeatedly suggested by this
                            Embassy.</p>

                        <p>949. Embassy’s 945, December 23, 12 a.m. King sent to-day for French
                            Ambassador and asked that he urge his Government to request our
                            Government to permit exports of cotton to Spain. French Ambassador
                            replied that he was not in a position to accede to King’s wishes,
                            because it was impossible for him to secure from His Majesty’s
                            Government permits to export the purchases made here by French
                            authorities. King then stated that he was anxious for an arrangement
                            under which desired exchanges could be made. French Ambassador has
                            telegraphed his Government fully. Embassy respectfully suggests thorough
                            and immediate understanding between United States and French Government
                            on this subject, renews suggestions contained in its 945 December 23, 12
                            a.m., and its request for definite instructions.</p>

                        <p>950. Embassy’s No. 945, December 23, 12 noon, and 949, December 24, 11
                            p.m. Situation here may become delicate. King’s wishes as he expressed
                            them to French Ambassador yesterday should be promptly met. In meantime
                            Embassy should have authority, with approval of French Ambassador, to
                            make with Foreign Office reciprocal exchanges of permits to export.
                            Nevertheless, it would be fatal at this juncture to discontinue or to
                            lift embargo, especially on cotton. This is our strongest lever to
                            induce reciprocal action on part of Spain and is just beginning to be
                            felt, and if withdrawn will leave Embassy without influence with present
                            Government. It should be used with care and tact but first [<hi

                        <p>960. Department’s 802 December 26, 6 p.m. After full discussion with
                            French Ambassador he will make agreement, between Allies and the United
                            States on one side and Spain on the other, such as is desired by the
                            King (see Embassy’s 950 December 25, 8 p.m.) and as is reported by
                            French Ambassador to be now under consideration by the Allied
                            representation in Paris; authority is requested to inform Foreign Office
                            immediately as follows: that on account of our growing needs and the
                            needs of our cobelligerents and after January 1, 1918, the embargoes
                            against the exportation of certain commodities as proclaimed by the
                            President under date of July 9 and August 27, 1917, respectively,<note
                                n="1" xml:id="d357fn1">See <hi rend="italic">Ante</hi>, <ref

                                    >933</ref>, respectively.</note> will be enforced and that <pb

                            thereto will be made except in exchange for reciprocal permits to export
                            those articles the exportation of which is prohibited here.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy ventures again to suggest that the enforcement of our embargo
                            especially on cotton is absolutely essential in order to secure these
                            commodities. It appears that our embargo up to the present time has not
                            been enforced for the Embassy is informed through newspapers, and
                            otherwise, that there is now in transit from the United States and due
                            in Barcelona within next fortnight more than 30,000 bales of cotton.</p>
                        <p>If this policy is followed all attempts to secure from the Foreign Office
                            reciprocal exchanges of embargoed commodities are useless. …</p>
                        <p>Referring again to Inter-Allied Conference now being held in Paris as
                            reported by French Ambassador, but concerning which this Embassy is
                            without information, such negotiations should include the important
                            question of rate of exchange between respective countries, parties
                            thereto. Embassy agrees with King and Foreign Office that negotiations
                            should be promptly inaugurated and if possible definite arrangements
                            consummated. However, in meanwhile and supplemental to above suggestion,
                            Embassy submits following <hi rend="italic">modus vivenddi:</hi>

                            in position, as much to be desired, of approving confidentially through

                            submitted. By experience and knowledge of conditions in Spain, Mr.

                            entrusted to him and the fact that Mr. <persName>Belmont</persName> will
                            soon, after his visit to Spain, return to America will enable him to
                            report to the Department very fully the result of his observations. The

                            certain measures of interdiction against purchases in Spain have been
                            formulated by the French Government and some action will have to be
                            taken in modifying these measures. It was reported by the French
                            delegates present that the French Ambassador, Mr.
                                <persName>Thierry</persName>, had just telegraphed that the Spanish
                            Government was very much concerned over the situation all around both as
                            it concerns getting cotton and oil from the United States as well as the
                            exportation of Spanish products to France. The opinion was expressed
                            that it was an opportune time to get the concessions from Spain.</p>
                        <p>Those chosen to go to Spain are expected to leave within the next three
                            or four days.</p>

                        <p>In your negotiations with the Spanish Government under third, <hi
                                rend="italic">supra</hi>, you should bear in mind the desirability
                            of securing from Spain charters of such Spanish tonnage as is not
                            absolutely necessary to Spain. If a satisfactory commercial agreement
                            can be entered into with Spain, there will, in all probability, be a
                            considerable surplus after providing for all Spanish needs, of which
                            surplus it should be our aim to secure a share in return for concessions
                            we may make in issuing export licenses. Department believes that it will
                            be very difficult to secure this tonnage for Allied needs from the
                            Spanish, but wishes you to have this point in mind during your
                            negotiations,</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Have had conference with War Office regarding postal and cable
                            censorship. British method based on geographical conditions is to have
                            main office and control in London with branch office at Liverpool for
                            censorship of mail to and from America. French are obliged to have
                            branches at Paris, Marseille, Swiss and Spanish frontiers, and at Brest
                            and Havre for cable service, thus losing advantage English censor has in
                            reading answer to the letter or cable he has already seen, which
                            advantage is great in the detection of codes concealed in commercial
                            phraseology, and in the detection of plans to trade in contraband. I
                            hope it will be possible to arrange that all United States foreign mail
                            may pass through say two ports each on Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, and
                            Pacific coasts where branches might be established which will relieve us
                            of difficulties and obviate necessity for establishment of censorship at
                            inland points, such as Chicago, <hi rend="italic">et cetera.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>War Office inform me they and the French both hope our earliest efforts
                            at censorship may be directed at the Central and South American and the
                            Far Eastern mails and cables, virgin fields hitherto untouched by the
                            Allies and of the greatest importance. British and French can continue
                            with the transatlantic censorship indefinitely until we are ready for
                            business.</p>

                                >Balfour</persName>’s mission, is taking copious memoranda on
                            censorship. He personally may be well acquainted with the theory but can
                            have but little practical knowledge. War Office have promised me that,
                            if our Government requests it, they will lend us their best technical
                            experts capable of explaining to ours the organization and practical
                            workings of this vitally important department. <persName>Frank
                                Worthington</persName>, deputy chief censor, second in command, who
                            understands this work better than any Englishman living, has promised me
                            he will go to America if asked. …</p>
                        <p>I consider this a splendid opportunity to start our censorship right and
                            can not sufficiently urge importance of doing so and of profiting by the
                            knowledge gained by bitter experience here.</p>
                        <p>War Office agree with me no need await arrival of
                                <persName>Dansey</persName> to decide this matter. Please consult
                            proper people and have Ambassador officially instructed to ask for loan
                            of Worthington and assistants if you want them. If so I suggest all
                            expenses be paid and per diem allowance made by our Government,
                            proportionate to their present pay.</p>

                                    705</ref>.</note> British Government understands that United
                            States telegraph censorship includes control of censorship established
                            at Panama Canal controlling correspondence between North and South.</p>
                        <p>We contended in 1915 that the British censorship could not effectively
                            control telegrams between North and South owing to existing alternative
                            routes free from censorship and that partial control merely caused
                            irritation without corresponding advantage. British authorities
                            therefore abandoned censorship on their lines between points named.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Office now represents that if United States has established
                            censorship at Panama Canal it would be possible for this to be evaded by
                            use of British lines and in these circumstances enquires of me whether
                            it would not be desirable to reestablish British censorship which was
                            relaxed. Please instruct me.</p>

                        <p>6561. Your 5051, June 27, 3 p.m. The British Government’s position is
                            that they hold themselves free to censor all mail addressed <pb n="1236"
                                xml:id="pg_1236" facs="0482"/>to consuls whether of neutral or
                            Allied countries but as an act of courtesy they refrain from examining
                            communications from the consul’s government or from his government’s
                            diplomatic representative in this country, all other mail whether or not
                            addressed to consuls in their official capacity is subject to censorship
                            in respect to mail leaving this country. British consuls abroad are
                            subject to same regulations as other consuls.</p>
                        <p>I understand that by special arrangement with French censorship mail from
                            France is not censored on arrival in this country but in the absence of
                            postal censorship in the United States I fear no similar arrangement is
                            possible for us. Present system is inconvenient as it involves
                            examination by British authorities of commercial inquiries from the
                            United States. Would it be possible privately to circularize Chamber of
                            Commerce and other business organizations and suggest that all such
                            inquiries, particularly those relating to trade after the war, be made
                            through the Department?</p>

                        <p>6663. My 6407, June 8, 5 p.m. Foreign Office informs me that in
                            consequence of a further request from our Navy Department this matter
                            has been reconsidered and subject to your concurrence it is proposed to
                            send to the United States an officer of the British cable censorship to
                            act as liaison officer between the two censorships, place <pb n="1237"

                            United States chief censor and serve as a channel for communication
                            between the latter and the chief cable censor at the War Office. He
                            would be accompanied by an officer of the British post office who has
                            acted as confidential adviser to the chief cable censor on technical
                            matters throughout the war and who has complete knowledge of the
                            principles on which the British cable censorship is based. The liaison
                            officer could remain in America as long as his services were required.

                            communicating with his Government through State Department if the State
                            Department wished to forward messages. Department will probably forward
                            message from Minister on subject of bags mentioned above and giving his
                            views as to the necessity of Swedish Government making a more adequate
                            explanation on the whole subject. He was advised informally that the
                            latter will be helpful to their case. Swedish Secretary is leaving this
                            week with pouches for Swedish Foreign Office. Department feels that
                            nothing could be gained particularly by holding these pouches up if
                            properly sealed. Department realizes that treatment of these pouches is
                            solely within the jurisdiction of the British Government and expresses
                            its views for your guidance in the event of a possible discussion of the
                            question.</p>

                        <p>5608. In regard to detention of Swedish mail by British Government, you
                            may unofficially and informally approach the British Government and say
                            that this Government feels that nothing is being gained by holding up
                            delivery of these pouches. The contents of the pouches can not be of
                            such a character as to do any serious damage to Great Britain or this
                            country, and this Government is disposed to accept the assurances of the
                            Minister. Negotiations between Sweden and the United States are being
                            seriously hampered by the failure to get the data stated to be among
                            this mail, and there is feeling in this country that the Swedes have
                            been punished enough. The President is taking a personal interest in the
                            matter and spoke to me this morning substantially along the lines stated
                            above.</p>

                            would not give any guarantee that bags would not be held up in the

                        <p>The Swedish Minister called and told me that he had received the bags
                            that had been held at the British Embassy, and he wished to thank me for
                            the assistance that we had rendered. He said that the British Ambassador
                            had told him that the bags had been delivered in view of the fact that
                            the Swedish Government had changed and a more friendly government was in
                            control. The Ambassador apparently made no mention of the fact that the
                            British Government was not satisfied as to its contents. The Minister
                            said he had opened the bags and had not bothered me to have anyone
                            represent the Department. He also wished to assure us there was nothing
                            in the bags of an improper nature. He asked whether I thought that his
                            course had been wise, and I told him that personally I thought that he
                            had made a mistake in not having some one present so the papers could be
                            assured as to their contents; as far as we were concerned, we did not
                            wish to be present, but it would have been a great protection to him,
                            and I thought personally he had made a great mistake. He told me of one
                            letter in the pouch which he said would not be delivered.</p>

                        <p>This question involves the confiscation of enemy private property found
                            within the United States as a belligerent on the outbreak of war. It
                            might be argued that inasmuch as these vessels are subsidized by the
                            German Government and are more or less under its control, they partake
                            of the nature of enemy public property, which is confiscable by the
                            belligerent in whose possession it is found; but I think this would be
                            regarded as a strained interpretation of their character, and I would,
                            therefore, prefer to regard the vessels as privately-owned enemy
                            property. As to the disposition of enemy private property thus situated,
                            there are two views among authorities on international law. According to
                            the one view, there is an obligation that they should be exempt from
                            confiscation except in the exigency of military necessity, public
                            safety, or reprisal. This is the European Continental view.</p>
                        <p>According to the Anglo-American view, the sovereign possesses the right
                            to require confiscation if this should be found necessary, but leans
                            toward a general policy of exemption. The difference in effect between
                            these two views is not very great. In practice, however, nations as a
                            rule seem to recognize the exemption of private property as a policy
                            which ought to be followed save in exceptional cases. Confiscation in
                            the nature of <hi rend="italic">reprisal</hi> is a well-established
                            method of international practice by which one nation obtains redress for
                            injuries inflicted by another nation when other means of satisfaction
                            have failed.</p>
                        <p>The confiscation of enemy private property within the jurisdiction of the
                            United States upon the outbreak of war has been stated by the Supreme
                            Court of the United States to be contrary to “the modern usage of
                            nations which has become law.” (<hi rend="italic">Brown</hi> v. <hi

                                    conceded. The mitigations of this rigid rule, which the humane

                            Congress specially authorize the confiscation of enemy property.
                            Congress passed confiscatory acts during the War of Independence and the
                            Civil War—the acts of August 6, 1861, July 17, 1862, March 3, 1863, and
                            the Joint Resolution of July 17, 1862. These acts were passed presumably
                            under the power delegated by the Constitution to Congress to make rules
                            concerning “captures on land and water.” (<hi rend="italic">8 Cranch

                        <p>It may be said, however, in behalf of prize procedure, that it is a
                            procedure understood and recognized throughout the world in condemnation
                            of enemy property. It is also well understood that a prize court is a
                            municipal court, set up by the sovereign and subject to his will. In the
                            absence, however, of municipal laws controlling the action of a prize
                            court, it is supposed to administer the law of nations, and on this
                            supposition its international standing is based. There are, however,
                            many instances in which prize court decisions have been objected to by
                            one belligerent, re-heard in international arbitrations, and overruled.
                            But, being set up by municipal law and subject to municipal law, it is
                            difficult to perceive why a decision of a prize court should be in
                            principle more highly regarded by foreign countries than any other act
                            of a sovereign in harmony with the rights accorded him by international
                            law, one of which rights is to confiscate enemy property or to
                            requisition it upon payment of just compensation.</p>
                        <p>It seems to have been the practice of British and American prize courts
                            to regard as <hi rend="italic">prize</hi> (strictly so called) only such
                            property as is seized by the naval forces of the belligerents, whether
                            on the high seas, in foreign waters, in home waters, or in their own
                            territory, unless a different rule has been set up by the sovereign. In
                            the United States it seems that a different rule has been established
                            for the consideration of seizures of property on “inland waters” by the

                        </p>
                        <p>The only question before a prize court is whether the captured property
                            is good prize or not; that is, whether it should be condemned as hostile
                            property or released as innocent property. If the German ships lying in
                            United States ports should turn out to be partly owned by American
                            citizens or neutral subjects, the interest in the vessels so owned would
                            not ordinarily be condemned, but the vessels would be condemned for the
                            use of the United States subject to any such interest.</p>
                        <p>It was formerly the custom to condemn a prize for the benefit of the
                            officers and men making the captures. This distinguished the proceeding
                            from that of other forfeitures. This was the practice in the United
                            States up to 1899, when the right of the captors to prize money or
                            bounty was abolished by the act of March 3, 1899 (<hi rend="italic">30

                        <p>Answering the question specifically, I am of the opinion that there is no
                            rule of international law requiring that the ships in question be
                            condemned in prize courts rather than by any other procedure selected by
                            Congress with opportunity for neutral and American owners to be heard in
                            court. For example, the sentence of a foreign court of admiralty has
                            been recognized by United States courts in the following cases: <hi

                        </p>
                        <p>In case Congress should decide not to enact laws to confiscate these
                            ships, but should, on the contrary, follow the more moderate custom of
                            requisitioning the vessels as enemy private property upon payment of
                            compensation, I offer the following comments upon the subject of
                            requisition:</p>
                        <p>It is, I believe, the modern view that enemy private property should be
                            requisitioned when necessary upon the payment of compensation rather
                            than confiscated. This is the rule agreed to by the nations at The Hague
                            in Convention No. 6, 1907, relating to the status of enemy merchant
                            ships at the outbreak of hostilities. The United States, however, did
                            not sign this convention, on the ground, among others, that it did not
                            give complete freedom for vessels of the enemy in port at the outbreak
                            of hostilities to depart. In this connection, <pb n="1250"
                                xml:id="pg_1250" facs="0496"/>moreover, it should be considered that

                        <p>As most of the German vessels were, on April 6, owned by nonresident
                            German corporations, with only operating agents here, only two or three
                            vessels lying in our insular ports being possibly owned by Germans
                            residing there, and as they are not to be taken for the use of the
                            “armed force” of the United States, it would seem that this stipulation
                            of the treaty would, as a practical matter, have little application to
                            vessels in United States ports. I have not exact data, however, as to

                            in control of armed forces. Many cases of requisitions of goods for the
                            use of American forces have occurred, of course, but these have been
                            within territory occupied by the Army in the Mexican and Civil Wars. In
                            the Mexican and Civil Wars, goods were requisitioned without an act of
                            Congress by order of the President as Commander in Chief, but receipts
                            for the goods taken, or money payments were generally made, though the
                            right was asserted that requisition might be made without compensation.

                                claim, for that claim has its very foundation in the judicial
                                decision, and its validity depends upon the justice of the court’s
                                proceedings and conclusion. It is an elementary doctrine of
                                diplomacy that the citizen must exhaust his remedy in the local
                                courts before he can fall back upon his Government for diplomatic
                                redress; he must then present such a case as will authorize that
                                Government to urge that there has been a failure of justice. The
                                diplomatic claim, therefore, is based not more upon the original
                                wrong upon which the court decided than upon the action and
                                conclusion of the court itself, and, diplomatically speaking, there
                                is no claim until the courts have decided. That decision, then, is
                                not only not final, but, on the contrary, is the beginning, the very
                                corner-stone, of the international controversy. (<hi rend="italic"

                            correspondence of the United States in the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Attualità</hi> case, moreover, was based on the principle that even
                            government-owned ships, if engaged in ordinary commerce, were subject to
                            the rules and regulations of ordinary commercial vessels. In both the
                                <hi rend="italic">Attualità</hi> case and the Russian case the court
                            took jurisdiction, but the Governments concerned did not have actual
                            official possession of the vessels.</p>
                        <p>I believe that it is sound principle that when a government enters into
                            business it should be generally subject to the same rules which would
                            apply to individuals conducting the same business (<hi rend="italic">U.

                            this principle has been generally adopted by foreign nations, and it is
                            possible at the present time that foreign governments would accede to
                            representations of the United States based upon government ownership of
                            the German ships in question. The United States, however, believing that
                            the principle just stated is sound, and having based its correspondence
                            in the <hi rend="italic">Attualità</hi> case upon this principle, would
                            be in a difficult position if it made such representations to a foreign
                            government whose courts had assumed to take jurisdiction of a German
                            vessel condemned to the United States.</p>

                            received an inquiry from the Agent General for Queensland as to whether

                            what arrangements the Government of the United States propose to make

                            for Queensland as to what facilities may be obtained for the release of

                            consignees, I beg to advise you of the receipt of a letter, dated June
                            16, 1917, from the Secretary of the Treasury, in substance as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">Elsass</hi> was taken into custody at Pago Pago,
                            Samoa, by the Navy Department, which has had the vessel taken to
                            Honolulu for <pb n="1257" xml:id="pg_1257" facs="0503"/>repairs. The
                            Secretary of the Navy informs the Secretary of the Treasury, under date
                            of June 8, that the Navy Department, although repairing the vessel for
                            service, has issued no instructions about the cargo which, he states,
                            will remain in the ship and be turned over to the representatives of the
                            Treasury Department with the vessel.</p>
                        <p>So far as the Treasury Department is informed at present, the German
                            vessels which are or have been at Honolulu, are the only ones that have
                            any foreign cargoes. The collector of customs at that port was recently
                            instructed to take possession of such cargoes and send them to general
                            order [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] under Section 2880, Revised Statutes,
                            and that if application should be made by the owners for permission to
                            make entry, such applications should be submitted to the Treasury
                            Department, stating the names of the owners and what disposition they
                            propose to make of the goods.</p>
                        <p>The Attorney General has advised the Treasury Department that the Joint
                            Resolution of May 12, 1917,<note n="1" xml:id="d395fn2">Quoted in
                                Executive order of June 30, 1917, <hi rend="italic">infra.</hi>
                            </note> which authorized the President to take possession and title of
                            certain vessels evidently does not apply to the cargoes of the vessels.
                            It appears, therefore, no longer necessary to consider the cargoes in
                            connection with this Joint Resolution.</p>
                        <p>So far as the customs laws are concerned, the cargoes may be either
                            entered for consumption upon the production of proper bills of lading
                            and invoices or for warehouse and immediate exportation under article
                            247 of the Customs Regulations of 1915, without the production of bills
                            of lading.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary of the Treasury adds that, if your Embassy will indicate
                            which of the consignments it desires to go forward, the collector of
                            customs will be instructed to accept entry therefor.</p>

                                >Dreadnought</hi>, are in Pacific coast ports of the United States
                            about ready to sail for Chilean ports with merchant cargoes for delivery
                            there, and to return with cargoes obtained there. The United States
                            Government has no interest in the cargoes. These vessels were German
                            merchant ships lying in the territorial waters of the United States at
                            the outbreak of the war, and have been seized under the authority of the
                            Joint Resolution of Congress of May 12, 1917, authorizing the President
                            to take possession and title of such ships—the question of compensation
                            to be determined later by Congress. These ships are under time-charter
                            for this voyage, but the title to the vessels is in the United States,
                            and they are under the control of and are being operated by the United
                            States Shipping Board. The masters and crews are appointed by the
                            Shipping Board and are therefore in the employ of the United States. It
                            is feared that these vessels might be libeled or otherwise drawn into
                            litigation upon arrival in Chile by Germans or other persons claiming
                            title or interest in them, with resulting delay and loss of the use of
                            the ships. What, in your opinion, is the chance of these vessels
                            discharging and loading in Chilean ports without litigation being
                            instituted? Is it advisable to obtain from the Chilean Government an
                            assurance that if litigation is instituted, the vessels will not be
                            delayed or held on that account, but will be released without bail? If
                            such an assurance be obtained, is there likelihood that it would be
                            violated, or if the courts did take jurisdiction, would the Government
                            force the release of the vessels in accordance with the assurance?</p>

                            <p>According to the <hi rend="italic">note verbale</hi> of the Swiss
                                Legation of May 30, 1917, No. A. VII. 3./3974, the Government of the
                                United States informed the Swiss Legation in Washington on March 10,
                                1917, that the seizure of certain German merchant vessels lying in
                                several American harbors was done merely for the protection of
                                American life and property and that this seizure in no sense
                                represented a transfer of ownership.</p>
                            <p>On the other hand, it appears from the telegram of the Swiss Legation
                                in Washington to the Political Department in Berne, dated April 6,
                                1917, and transmitted to the Foreign Office by <hi rend="italic"
                                    >note verbale</hi> of April 9, 1917, No. A. VII 3./1600, that
                                all of the German vessels lying in American harbors had been seized.
                                Furthermore, according to <hi rend="italic">The Official
                                    Bulletin</hi>, Washington, June 4, 1917, transmitted to the
                                Foreign Office by <hi rend="italic">note verbale</hi> of July 6,
                                1917, No. A. VII 3./5770, the American Navy Department has given new
                                names to fourteen of the German vessels seized.</p>
                            <p>It appears from this, that the American Government has proceeded
                                actually to seize the German ships lying in American harbors for the
                                purpose of appropriating them. The Imperial Government desires to
                                know what, according to the views of the American Government, is the
                                significance of this seizure and particularly whether the Government
                                has in fact requisitioned the German vessels with the intention of
                                acquiring title or merely for a temporary use, and in either case
                                how the Government purposes to regulate the question of
                                compensation.</p>
                            <p>The Foreign Office would be indebted to the Swiss Legation if it
                                could obtain information with reference to this matter, from the
                                Government of the United States through the medium of the Swiss
                                Legation in Washington.</p>

                            Maintenance of its Neutrality which are in addition to the general
                            “Rules and Regulations for the Operation and Navigation of the Panama
                            Canal and Approaches Thereto, including all Waters under its
                            jurisdiction” put into force by Executive Order of July 9, 1914.</p>
                        <p>Rule 1. A vessel of war, for the purposes of these rules, is defined as a
                            public armed vessel, under the command of an officer duly commissioned
                            by the government, whose name appears on the list of officers of the
                            military fleet, and the crew of which are under regular naval
                            discipline, which vessel is qualified by its armament and the character
                            of its personnel to take offensive action against the public or private
                            ships of the enemy.</p>
                        <p>Rule 2. An auxiliary vessel, for the purposes of these rules, is defined
                            as any vessel, belligerent or neutral, armed or unarmed, which does not
                            fall under the definition of Rule 1, which is employed as a transport or
                            fleet auxiliary or in any other way for the direct purpose of
                            prosecuting or aiding hostilities, whether by land or sea; but a vessel
                            fitted up and used exclusively as a hospital ship is excepted.</p>

                        <p>Rule 3. A vessel of war or an auxiliary vessel of a belligerent, other
                            than the United States, shall only be permitted to pass through the
                            Canal after her commanding officer has given written assurance to the
                            Authorities of the Panama Canal that the Rules and Regulations will be
                            faithfully observed.</p>
                        <p>The authorities of the Panama Canal shall take such steps as may be
                            requisite to insure the observance of the Rules and Regulations by
                            auxiliary vessels which are not commanded by an officer of the military
                            fleet.</p>
                        <p>Rule 4. Vessels of war or auxiliary vessels of a belligerent, other than
                            the United States, shall not revictual nor take any stores in the Canal
                            except so far as may be strictly necessary; and the transit of such
                            vessels through the Canal shall be effected with the least possible
                            delay in accordance with the Canal Regulations in force, and with only
                            such intermission as may result from the necessities of the service.</p>
                        <p>Prizes shall be in all respects subject to the same Rules as vessels of
                            war of a belligerent.</p>
                        <p>Rule 5. No vessel of war or auxiliary vessel of a belligerent, other than
                            the United States, shall receive fuel or lubricants while within the
                            territorial waters of the Canal Zone, except on the written
                            authorization of the Canal Authorities, specifying the amount of fuel
                            and lubricants which may be received.</p>
                        <p>Rule 6. Before issuing any authorization for the receipt of fuel and
                            lubricants by any vessel of war or auxiliary vessel of a belligerent,
                            other than the United States, the Canal Authorities shall obtain a
                            written declaration, duly signed by the officer commanding such vessel,
                            stating the amount of fuel and lubricants already on board.</p>
                        <p>Rule 7. Fuel and lubricants may be taken on board vessels of war or
                            auxiliary vessels of a belligerent, other than the United States, only
                            upon permission of the Canal Authorities, and then only in such amounts
                            as will enable them, with the fuel and lubricants already on board, to
                            reach the nearest accessible port, not an enemy port, at which they can
                            obtain supplies necessary for the continuation of the voyage. Provisions
                            furnished by contractors may be supplied only upon permission of the
                            Canal Authorities, and then only in amount sufficient to bring up their
                            supplies to the peace standard.</p>
                        <p>Rule 8. No belligerent, other than the United States, shall embark or
                            disembark troops, munitions of war, or warlike materials in the Canal,
                            except in case of necessity due to accidental hindrance of the transit.
                            In such cases the Canal Authorities shall be the judge of the necessity,
                            and the transit shall be resumed with all possible dispatch.</p>

                        <p>Rule 9. Vessels of war or auxiliary vessels of a belligerent, other than

                            Canal Zone under the jurisdiction of the United States longer than
                            twenty-four hours at any one time, except in case of distress; and in
                            such case, shall depart as soon as possible.</p>
                        <p>Rule 10. In the exercise of the exclusive right of the United States to
                            provide for the regulation and management of the Canal, and in order to
                            ensure that the Canal shall be kept free and open on terms of entire
                            equality to vessels of commerce and of war, there shall not be, except
                            by special arrangement, at any one time a greater number of vessels of
                            war of any one nation, other than the United States, including those of
                            the allies of such nation, than three in either terminal port and its
                            adjacent terminal waters, or than three in transit through the Canal;
                            nor shall the total number of such vessels, at any one time, exceed six
                            in all the territorial waters of the Canal Zone under the jurisdiction
                            of the United States.</p>
                        <p>Rule 11. The repair facilities and docks belonging to the United States
                            and administered by the Canal Authorities shall not be used by a vessel
                            of war or an auxiliary vessel of a belligerent, other than the United
                            States, except when necessary in case of actual distress, and then only
                            upon the order of the Canal Authorities, and only to the degree
                            necessary to render the vessel seaworthy. Any work authorized shall be
                            done with the least possible delay.</p>
                        <p>Rule 12. The radio installation of any public or private vessel or of any
                            auxiliary vessel of a belligerent, other than the United States, shall
                            be used only in connection with Canal business to the exclusion of all
                            other business while within the waters of the Canal Zone, including the
                            waters of Colon and Panama Harbors.</p>
                        <p>Rule 13. Air craft, public or private, of a belligerent, other than the
                            United States, are forbidden to descend or arise within the jurisdiction
                            of the United States at the Canal Zone, or to pass through the air
                            spaces above the lands and waters within said jurisdiction.</p>
                        <p>Rule 14. For the purpose of these rules the Canal Zone includes the
                            cities of Panama and Colon and the harbors adjacent to the said
                            cities.</p>
                        <p>Rule 15. In the interest of the protection of the Canal while the United
                            States is a belligerent no vessel of war, auxiliary vessel, or private
                            vessel of an enemy of the United States or an ally of such enemy shall
                            be allowed to use the Panama Canal nor the territorial waters of the
                            Canal Zone for any purpose, save with the consent of the Canal
                            authorities and subject to such rules and regulations as they may

                                subject so that it may be taken into account in answering Minister

                        <p>His Majesty’s Consul at Colon reports that the proclamation of neutrality
                            of Canal Zone is still considered to be in force, and that troop
                            transports and naval auxiliaries can only be supplied with sufficient
                            coal to take them to the nearest British port, namely Jamaica. His
                            Majesty’s Consul adds that Canal authorities have <pb n="1270"
                                xml:id="pg_1270" facs="0516"/>plenty of coal available, and are
                            willing to supply it, if special arrangements can be made through
                            diplomatic channel. Relying on the assurances of the United States
                            Government that no objection would be raised on their part, His
                            Majesty’s Government have made arrangements for the carriage of
                            Australasian troops through the Canal. Two transports are due at Colon
                            on August 30th and another on September 4th, each requiring to take on
                            board there 2,000 tons of coal.</p>
                        <p>A situation of great embarrassment will arise if the United States
                            Government now insist on applying to our transports rules of
                            proclamation of neutrality of Canal Zone. This will wreck the whole
                            scheme for transport of Australasian troops through the Canal, and
                            anticipated saving of tonnage under that scheme will be thrown away.</p>
                        <p>The United States Government hold, no doubt, that they are justified, by
                            their sovereignty in Canal Zone, in relieving their own men-of-war and
                            transports of restrictions. But if this contention is well founded, as
                            would seem to be the case, the United States Government would be equally
                            justified in relieving men-of-war and transports of their
                            co-belligerents, in extending to them the same treatment as they would
                            be given in United States territory proper.</p>
                        <p>His Majesty’s Government does not desire to raise the question as to the
                            right to differentiate in favour of United States vessels in the Canal,
                            which of course has been already the subject of prolonged negotiation;
                            but they express the hope that under present circumstances such
                            differentiation will not be applied to the disadvantage of Great
                            Britain, in a matter of such vital importance to the conduct of the
                            war.</p>
                        <p>In this connection attention is called to the request made on June 5th
                            that the dry dock and repair shops at Balboa may be made available for
                            the ships of the British Pacific Squadron, and that they may be supplied
                            with the coal, oil and stores which may be required.</p>
                        <p>The matter is of urgent importance and an answer is requested as soon as
                            possible.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>By its communications of June 5 and August 13, His Britannic Majesty’s
                            Embassy inquires whether the dry dock and repair shops at Balboa may be
                            made available for the ships of the British Pacific <pb n="1271"
                                xml:id="pg_1271" facs="0517"/>Squadron, and whether they may be
                            supplied with coal, oil and stores as required; and whether transports
                            carrying troops will be allowed transit facilities through the
                            Canal.</p>
                        <p>There is enclosed a copy of the President’s proclamation of May 23, 1917,
                            for the “Regulation, Management, and Protection of the Panama Canal and
                            the Maintenance of Its Neutrality,”<note n="1" xml:id="d406fn1">
                                <hi rend="italic">Ante</hi>, <ref target="#pg_1265">p.
                                1265</ref>.</note> which appears to cover the inquiry of His.
                            Majesty’s Embassy.</p>
                        <p>From this proclamation it will be observed that fuel and lubricants may
                            be taken on board by vessels of a belligerent in the Canal in amounts
                            sufficient to reach the nearest accessible port, not an enemy port, at
                            which they can obtain supplies necessary for the continuance of the
                            voyage. It is the Department’s opinion that if it is not possible for
                            British vessels to obtain coal, oil, etc., in sufficient quantities at
                            British ports other than those in England, British vessels could, under
                            the proclamation, be allowed to take on sufficient amounts to reach
                            ports in the British Isles.</p>
                        <p>As to the passage of transports through the Canal with troops, there is
                            perceived to be no objection so long as the reasonable provision of the
                            proclamation in regard to the embarkation and disembarkation of troops,
                            munitions of war or warlike materials and the other provisions of the
                            proclamation relating to passage through the Canal are complied
                            with.</p>
                        <p>As to the use of the dry dock and repair shops at Balboa, it will be
                            observed that the proclamation restricts the use of such facilities to
                            cases of “actual distress.”</p>
                        <p>As the provisions of the proclamation in this respect and in others are
                            based upon the treaties of the United States covering the status of the
                            Isthmus and the diplomatic correspondence on the same subject with the
                            countries concerned which, in a word, place upon the United States the
                            duty and responsibility for maintaining the “neutrality” or
                            “neutralization” of the Canal and its approaches, the Department of
                            State regrets that, in its opinion, to allow the unlimited use of the
                            dry dock and repair shops at Balboa by the British Pacific Squadron
                            would be an infringement of the peculiar status of the Canal which the
                            United States is under obligation to maintain. The Canal and its
                            approaches, in the opinion of the Department, should not be made a
                            rendezvous for belligerent ships or a base of naval equipment and
                            repair.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>With reference to the memorandum of the Department of State of August
                            15th and to previous correspondence regarding the arrangements to be
                            made for the passage of Australian and New Zealand troops through the
                            Panama Canal, the British Embassy has received instructions from London
                            to ascertain whether the United States authorities would be able to
                            arrange hospital accommodation at Panama for invalids from the
                            transports carrying these troops and could also provide for the
                            replenishment of medical stores. Should it be considered preferable,
                            however, and should there be no objection thereto, the Australian
                            Government would be ready to establish a temporary hospital at
                            Panama.</p>
                        <p>An early reply would be appreciated as the matter is one of some
                                urgency.<note n="1" xml:id="d407fn1">An attached memorandum by the
                                Assistant Secretary of State, dated Aug. 29, reads in part that “the
                                British Embassy has been orally informed that the question of
                                hospital accommodations is to be left to the requirements of each
                                shipload. In other words, when a British transport arrives in Panama
                                the Embassy is to be informed of what is needed, whereupon the
                                Secretary of War, as an act of humanity, will issue the necessary
                                instructions to the Zone authorities. In this way the Department
                                feels that the proclamation of neutrality need not be modified to
                                meet the British needs.”</note>

                                >Not printed.</note> I beg to advise you that the procedure for
                            instructions to Panama was established last July, and that we can now
                            give those in authority there any instructions which the board may

                        <p>At present the collectors at the ports of Panama and Colon are acting in
                            accordance with the decision of the Exports Council of July 9 which is
                            quoted below:</p>
                        <p>It was decided that “transit of cargoes and shipments through the Panama
                            Canal would not require export licenses.”</p>
                        <p>The collectors are at present allowing all vessels in transit through the
                            Canal to bunker as heretofore regardless of destination.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>In reply to your inquiry respecting the right to require licenses from
                            vessels passing through the Panama Canal under any treaties with foreign
                            nations, allow me to say that the status of the Panama Canal is
                            determined by the treaty between the United States and Colombia of 1846,
                            the Hay-Pauncefote treaty with Great Britain of 1901, and the treaty
                            with Panama of 1903; and by our diplomatic correspondence with these
                            countries. In these treaties and this correspondence the United States
                            guaranteed, among other things, the “neutrality” or “neutralization” of
                            the Canal, and that it should be “free and open” under certain rules. As
                            the licensing of vessels merely passing through the Canal and not
                            stopping for supplies is in the nature of a war measure aimed at the
                            destruction of the enemy, it is logical to conclude that the application
                            of such a measure to vessels passing through the Canal would be
                            inconsistent with the neutrality or neutralized status of the Isthmus.
                            In this I am not considering vessels passing to and from other portions
                            of American territory.</p>
                        <p>Any vessels passing through the Canal desiring to take on supplies
                            therein could, I believe, be controlled by license, as the conservation
                            of such supplies might be regarded as in the nature of a domestic
                            measure for the protection of the Canal, the duty and responsibility of
                            protection being conceded to the United States by treaty and diplomatic
                            correspondence. In so far as vessels passing through the Canal desire to
                            take on supplies, so far, I believe, the War Trade Board can control
                            those vessels by its licensing system, at least in respect to the
                            articles taken on board, their use, destination, <hi rend="italic">et

                            Governor of the Panama Canal, that we will give advices just as soon as
                            the board <pb n="1274" xml:id="pg_1274" facs="0520"/>passes a lot of new
                            regulations which they are now considering, and adopt special
                            application and license forms.</p>
                        <p>Meantime, I think a fairly safe procedure to follow regarding neutral
                            ships will be to allow any of them to pass through into the Pacific,
                            without restriction, when they have come direct from some United States
                            port, but if they have arrived from any other than a United States port,
                            bound into the Pacific to hold them and cable us full particulars and
                            await our instructions regarding license.</p>
                        <p>I also think it would be best for the present to have him hold up any
                            neutral vessels coming into the Canal from the Pacific if they are bound
                            to any other than United States ports, and cable to us for special
                            instructions in each instance, stating the name of the steamer,
                            nationality, register of tonnage (in case there may be more than one
                            vessel of the same name), destination and total quantity of bunkers
                            desired aboard when leaving the Canal, or in case of a sailing vessel,
                            hold her by refusing license for ships’ stores. Any neutral vessel,
                            however, that is bound directly to the United States allow to continue
                            without restriction.</p>

                            a letter from the British Embassy in Washington quoting the Assistant

                        <p>I made inquiry of <persName corresp="frus1917Supp02v01#p_HLC1">Col.

                            matter. He replied that there had been no formal response but that he
                            had been let know informally that the Department of War would be glad to
                            have this courtesy extended to the British Government but that it was
                            desired not to give an expression of this in any formal or written
                            manner. I then consulted with …</p>

                            and I both concluded after conferring, that it would be best to let
                            Panama convey, in an unwritten and informal manner to the British
                            Minister, its willingness to have the British Government exercise this
                            privilege, in accordance with their expressed desire to permit them to
                            have it, but for us not to give an expression regarding same in any
                            formal or written way. I have followed this method in another informal

                                extended in the waters of the Republic of Panama to a belligerent

                                three months or vice versa” is an impediment to British warships
                                entering the ports of the Republic of Panama now that the latter
                                nation is a belligerent, I have the honor to state that according to
                                a private opinion expressed recently by the Assistant Secretary of
                                State at Washington to His Majesty’s Ambassador, the ruling in
                                question, as far as the United States is concerned, is considered to

                                British warships using the ports of the Republic, in case of
                                necessity, for refitting and revictualling, notwithstanding that
                                they may have entered a Canal Zone port within the period of three

                            instructions, it has been necessary to formulate a policy for the
                            control of cargo originating in, or in transit through, the Canal Zone,
                            based on the information already received and in accord with local
                            conditions.</p>
                        <p>Under date of November 28, a circular, three copies of which are
                            attached, was addressed to all concerned on the subject of export
                            licenses, although exports had been under control and licenses granted
                            here for some time prior to this date, as your records will show. A
                            second circular was issued under date of December 12, three copies of
                            which are also attached, together with three copies of the form of
                            shipper’s export declaration referred to in the last mentioned

                            With the triplicate copy of the declaration, and the triplicate copy of
                            the cargo license, there will be forwarded to your office a copy of the
                            vessel’s manifest in each case.</p>
                        <p>Of course, this arrangement is possible in the Canal Zone only, because
                            all cargo at Canal Zone ports is unladed, transferred, and laded by the
                            Panama Railroad Co., which is a U. S. Government corporation.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, in any consideration of the question of export control in
                            the Canal Zone it should be borne in mind that the Panama Canal, a
                            department of the U. S. Government, maintains an effective control over
                            the movement of all shipping in Canal waters; therefore, if it is
                            decided, for instance, to grant bunkers to any particular ship, the
                            captain of the port, who is a Canal official, is so advised, and the
                            actual issuance of the paper form of license is not deemed necessary, as
                            the coal is supplied by the Panama Canal.</p>
                        <p>In the same way, it is believed that the matter of transit and
                            transhipped cargo can be handled in the manner indicated in the
                            Governor’s circular of December 12, without the necessity of actually
                            issuing form licenses except for cargo in classes Nos. 7 and 8. Since
                            the main desire is to control exports, and since the issuance of the
                            paper form is only incidental to this control, it is believed that the
                            arrangement whereby all shipping papers for cargo in the classes
                            indicated in the circular of December 12 are submitted to the Bureau of
                            Customs for notation upon the papers as to whether or not the cargo may
                            go forward, should be satisfactory.</p>
                        <p>The Bureau of Customs is a branch of the Division of Civil Affairs, the
                            Chief of which has charge of export control in the Canal Zone, as you
                            have been previously advised, and all actions of customs inspectors are
                            naturally subject to his supervision. Furthermore, the Panama Railroad
                            Co., whose receiving and forwarding agent signs the export declarations
                            referred to, is a corporation all of whose employees are employees of
                            the United States Government, and who are just as keenly interested in
                            the proper administration of exports control as are the employees of the
                            Bureau of Customs or any other branch of the Government.</p>
                        <p>It should be understood that under the present arrangement the only cargo
                            laded is that which falls in class 1 or 2, or has either been passed for
                            export by the Bureau of Customs or covered by regular license, and that
                            the receiving and forwarding agent of the Panama Railroad Co. submits a
                            statement to that effect with the outgoing manifest. Although the
                            circular states that the cargo of classes 1 and <pb n="1279"
                                xml:id="pg_1279" facs="0525"/>2 may be laded freely, an arrangement
                            exists whereby the receiving and forwarding agent notifies the Bureau of
                            Customs of any shipments in these classes which appear suspicious, even
                            when the shipments are covered by export license from the United States
                            or Allied countries. Such cargo is then examined, and held, if deemed
                            necessary, pending advice from the War Trade Board.</p>
                        <p>You will note that transhipped cargo under class 2 is being handled in
                            the same way as you have already authorized in the case of cargo of the
                            same nature which is merely being carried through the Canal by vessels
                            not stopping at either port. The authorization referred to was contained
                            in your letter of November 13 to the Washington Office of the Panama
                                Canal.<note n="1" xml:id="d415fn3">Not printed.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Should any feature of the method now in effect here be misunderstood or
                            deemed unsatisfactory, it is requested that the objection be referred to
                            this office before any definite action is taken.</p>

                            <p>You are advised that, effective at once, no cargo, excepting that
                                originating in the United States or possessions, and covered by
                                export license, or cargo destined to the United States or
                                possessions, shall be exported from Canal Zone ports without license
                                or permission from the Chief of the Division of Civil Affairs.</p>
                            <p>Applications shall be made in all cases to the chief customs
                                inspector at the port of exportation upon forms provided for that
                                purpose. Before accepting cargo for shipment carriers should request
                                the consignor to apply for license, attaching copies of the ocean
                                bill of lading to the application. If license is granted the bill of
                                lading will be stamped with the license number, and if license is
                                not required, the bill of lading will be so marked. The original
                                license will be delivered to the applicant, who should hand it to
                                the steamship company’s agent, with the completed bill of lading.
                                There is a stub upon this license which shall be detached and
                                completed by the chief customs inspector at the port of consignment,
                                and all bills of lading covering local or trans-shipped cargo,
                                together with all export licenses, and a complete manifest <pb
                                    n="1280" xml:id="pg_1280" facs="0526"/>of all local and
                                trans-shipped cargo must be furnished to the chief customs inspector
                                at the port of departure at least one hour before schedule time of
                                sailing of the vessel. The customs office will check the bills of
                                lading against the manifest and return all papers excepting the
                                manifest to the proper officers of the vessel.</p>

                                steamship company’s agent to make application for export license in
                                the absence of a regularly accredited agent of the consignor, or the
                                consignee on the Isthmus.</p>
                            <p>Please note that the stipulation relative to outgoing manifest
                                changes the present regulations, in that the manifest must be
                                submitted at least 1 hour before sailing time of the vessel, instead
                                of 48 hours afterward, and must contain a complete list, not only of
                                local cargo, but of all cargo trans-shipped at a Canal Zone
                                port.</p>

                                cargo is laded and as soon as possible after it is received. The
                                chief customs inspector will indicate upon the bill of lading or
                                accountable receipt whether or not the cargo may go forward.</p>
                            <p>All cargo of class 7, destined to European neutrals, must be covered

                                application for which should be made to the Bureau of Customs as far
                                in advance of shipment as possible. In the absence of a regularly
                                accredited agent of the consignor or the consignee on the Isthmus,
                                it will be necessary for the agent of the connecting carrier to make
                                such application.</p>
                            <p>For all cargo of class 8 applications for export licenses shall be
                                made by consignors as far in advance of date of shipment as possible
                                to the Bureau of Customs, which will indicate whether or not license
                                is required and furnish the necessary forms.</p>
                            <p>Instead of presenting bills of lading with the outgoing manifest,
                                which must be submitted at least one hour prior to the ship’s
                                departure, the receiving and forwarding agent shall hand the chief
                                customs inspector a shipper’s export declaration to the effect that
                                all cargo shown on the manifest has been properly passed upon. The
                                chief customs inspector will then issue an export license to the
                                vessel in question covering the entire cargo as shown in the
                                manifest.</p>

                                shipments of cargo in classes such as 7 and 8 will be covered by
                                export license, irrespective of the general cargo license which will
                                be granted to a vessel upon its departure.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The suggestion has been made that on
                            account of the great importance of securing nitrates for military and
                            agricultural purposes the vessels engaged in supplying the military and
                            civil necessities of the Panama Canal should be utilized by being given
                            a return cargo of nitrate from Chilean or other nitrate ports so that
                            the full tonnage capacity of these vessels may be utilized on their
                            outgoing and returning trips. Coal and other military supplies will
                            furnish a sufficient cargo from the United States to the Isthmus, but
                            there is not sufficient commercial or other business offering at that
                            point to afford a full return cargo for the vessels required, and I
                            believe that the use of this cargo capacity for nitrates is
                            imperative.</p>
                        <p>The question has arisen as to whether these vessels which are owned by
                            the United States would be interned if they should proceed to neutral
                            ports. It is proposed that the vessels all be operated by the Panama
                            Railroad Co., a corporation incorporated under the laws of the State of
                            New York, most of the stock of which is owned by the United States.</p>
                        <p>There is enclosed herewith a memorandum from the Chief of Office of the
                            Panama Canal which sets forth the status of all the vessels operated by
                            this company with respect to ownership.<note n="1" xml:id="d417fn1">Not

                        </p>
                        <p>I would request that you advise me as to whether in your opinion the
                            proposed undertaking could be safely carried on without any risk being
                            incurred of the vessels being interned in the neutral ports which they
                            would have to visit.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I understand from your letter of May 5
                            and conversations with Major <persName>Brown</persName> of the Panama
                            Canal Office that your Department <pb n="1284" xml:id="pg_1284"
                                facs="0530"/>desires to know whether any risk of internment in
                            neutral ports would arise in case of vessels owned by the United States
                            or by the Panama Railroad Co. and operated by that company and engaged
                            in supplying the military and civil necessities of the Panama Canal,
                            which, after delivering their cargo at the Isthmus, should proceed to
                            South American ports for the purpose of bringing back nitrates for the
                            use of the United States Government, and which, both in the carriage of
                            military and civil necessities to the Isthmus and the carriage of the
                            nitrates on the return voyage, are paid therefor by the Government
                            freight charges in the same manner as any other commercial vessels. In
                            reply I have the honor to advise you that in my opinion such vessels
                            engaged in commerce and submitting to the rules and regulations of
                            neutral ports applicable to merchant ships, not flying the naval or
                            transport flag, not armed, and not under command of naval or army
                            officers, would not be properly subject to internment by a neutral
                            country. As a neutral the United States has taken this position in the
                            present war and has not interned vessels chartered by the British
                            Admiralty, but forming no part of the military fleet and plying under
                            the merchant flag and subject to rules and regulations applicable to
                            merchant vessels in United States ports.</p>
                        <p>I should add, however, that there is, of course, always the possibility
                            that neutral governments may detain such vessels for purposes of
                            investigation and out of abundant caution endeavor to place them in the
                            category of public auxiliary ships of the armed forces of a belligerent.
                            In view of this possibility, I will be glad to make inquiry of the
                            neutral governments concerned as to their attitude toward the vessels in
                            question if you should desire me to do so.</p>

                            for Foreign Affairs informed me to-day that the Paraguayan Government
                            imposes no restrictions on the entrance into Paraguayan ports of armed
                            American merchant vessels engaged in commerce. The Minister added that
                            his Government considers the arming of merchant vessels necessary in
                            view of German submarine warfare.</p>

                        <p>German submarine now at Cadiz is UC–52. British Vice Consul, Cadiz, has
                            suggested to his Ambassador that he should apply for <pb n="1290"
                                xml:id="pg_1290" facs="0536"/>internment submarine on the grounds
                            that submarine should not have the same privileges as a man-of-war and
                            Spanish neutral port should not be used as base of supplies for such.
                            Suggests advisability of all the Allied Ambassadors making same request
                            for great effect on Spanish authorities. Have communicated with
                            Ambassador.</p>

                            base. This decision is based upon (1) the failure of the Hague
                            convention to make any distinction between a submarine and any other
                            style of war vessel and (2) upon the precedent set by the Spanish
                            Government in the Cartagena submarine case of some months ago. A time
                            limit has been set on or before the expiration of which said repairs
                            must be completed and submarine must set out for its base, but Minister
                            for Foreign Affairs declines to name the time limit. He states that time
                            limit was set as a result of careful investigation by Spanish naval
                            experts of repairs necessary, which examination disclosed that damages
                            were not result of any hostile encounter but were incident to ocean
                            travel, that commander of submarine stated [no?] action was had on the
                            date on which British Ambassador claims submarine was engaged with
                            English <pb n="1291" xml:id="pg_1291" facs="0537"/>torpedo-boat
                            destroyer, and otherwise confirmed by results of examination made by
                            Spanish experts. British Embassy states it has evidence, confirmed by
                            French Embassy, that submarine has already unloaded and deposited in
                            Spanish arsenal, Cadiz, six tons of explosives. British Ambassador
                            through his Secretary desires this Embassy to support his vigorous
                            protest made several days ago to Spanish Government and strenuously
                            renewed this afternoon under further instructions from his Government.
                            This Embassy has replied that it will await instructions from Department
                            before taking such action. My impression is that Spanish Government,
                            before actual release is granted, will demand guarantees from the German
                            Government that submarine will do no hostile act <hi rend="italic">en

                        <p>566. It has been reported to the Department that a number of Allied and
                            neutral merchant vessels have recently been destroyed by German
                            submarines within Spanish territorial waters. Please ask Foreign Office
                            if such is the fact, and what measures, if any, the Spanish Government
                            is taking to protect their neutrality in this respect. It is a matter of
                            grave importance to this Government inasmuch as among other
                            considerations our trade with Spain carried on by means of American
                            ships is endangered. Obtain and forward the sworn statements and all
                            other evidence of these violations of neutral waters from your British
                            colleague. In all cases of reports of violations of Spanish neutrality
                            the Department must have a complete, detailed and authentic statement of
                            facts before it can assume to act.</p>

                                <p>It is indisputable that submarines of the Central powers display
                                    great activity in proximity to Spanish waters but
                                    notwithstanding the protests and reclamations made by some of
                                    the Allied Governments based chiefly on the declarations of
                                    captains of ships which have been sunk or detained near Spain,
                                    the investigations carried on by the naval authorities show that
                                    the territorial waters have not been violated except in one
                                    case, viz., the Norwegian steamer <hi rend="italic">Tiger</hi>.
                                    The Government of His Majesty on the occasion of the detention
                                    of the above-mentioned ship within Spanish waters presented to
                                    the Cabinet at Berlin an energetic protest warning it that it
                                    was determined to prevent the repetition of such cases and would
                                    employ to that end the most energetic means which might be
                                    necessary. The German Government while sustaining that the
                                    detention and sinking of the <hi rend="italic">Tiger</hi> took
                                    place, according to its information, on the high seas stated
                                    nevertheless that it had given new and strict instructions to
                                    Imperial naval forces to rigidly respect neutral Spanish waters
                                    and to abstain from every act of hostility within them.</p>
                                <p>The Government of His Majesty exercises by every means in its
                                    power and tries to increase as far as possible the most severe
                                    vigilance in order to avoid the violation of its territorial
                                    waters, having issued for this purpose the Royal decree of June
                                    29 last prohibiting the entrance of submarines.</p>

                        <p>818. Embassy’s 816, October 7, 10 a.m.<note n="1" xml:id="d448fn1">Not
                                printed.</note> Spanish Government has suspended all naval
                            authorities Cadiz. President of Council states publicly that rigid
                            investigation will be held. English and Italian Ambassadors have written
                            Minister for Foreign Affairs expressing their keen disappointment and
                            expect that immediate steps will be taken to prevent escape of German
                            submarine interned at Ferrol, in response to which Government has given
                            desired assurances. Embassy will make no representations to Spanish
                            Government pending instructions. Escape of this submarine number <hi
                                rend="italic">U–293</hi> has created profound impression here.
                            Apparently Spanish Government deeply regrets occurrence, betrays great
                            resentment towards Germany and towards Spanish officers who have been
                            disloyal to their country. French naval attaché states that Spanish
                            officials Cadiz recently gave submarine ten tons fuel oil upon request
                            of its commander to enable him to test out accumulators under repairs.
                            Submarine was also supplied with provisions but apparently no
                            ammunition. Further information will be telegraphed when it can be
                            accurately secured.</p>

                        <p>The recent Allied Naval Conference in London recommended that steps
                            should be taken to ensure the close cooperation between Allied Ministers
                            in neutral countries with a view to making such representations as will
                            ensure adequate action to prevent submarines or suspicious enemy vessels
                            from being succoured or allowed to make use of territorial waters.</p>
                        <p>The British Embassy are instructed to ask that such instructions may be
                            sent to the United States representatives in neutral countries. The
                            French, Italian, Russian and Japanese Governments are being approached
                            in the same sense.</p>

                            asked Spanish Government to intern crews of all German merchant ships
                            now in Spanish ports, as he stated that they are centers of German
                            espionage and intrigue and used in furnishing supplies to
                            submarines.</p>

                        <p>British Minister has addressed a note to me inviting me to attend a
                            meeting of plenipotentiaries Entente powers November 8 to discuss
                            attitude they are to assume with regard to Argentina on the submarine
                            question. It [appears] that on August 25, 1916, Ministers of France,
                            Russia, England and Italy presented a joint memorandum to the Argentine
                            Government on the subject claiming principally that the rules previously
                            existing in international law should not be applied as to belligerent
                            submarines but that any submarine touching at a neutral port even for
                            less than 24 hours should be interned.</p>
                        <p>The note further states that he has just received a telegram from the
                            British Minister for Foreign Affairs stating that it is probable that
                            large German submarines will soon commence to operate in South American
                            waters, that in case one such should arrive in Argentine territorial
                            waters it is necessary that “the Allied Ministers” should be in concert
                            in order to obtain its immediate internment by Argentine
                            authorities.</p>
                        <p>Respectfully request immediate instruction, (1) whether to attend the
                            conference, (2) whether Department desires to give me any special
                            instructions if I do attend.</p>

                            Greece, and Portugal, to discuss the question of urging the Spanish
                            Government to intern the crews of German merchant vessels now in Spanish
                            ports. Although without actual proof, it was unanimously agreed that
                            these ships are used as bases where German submarines receive supplies,
                            information, and even crews. It was further agreed that all above
                            representatives should request authorization of their Governments to
                            support the note of the French Ambassador (see Embassy’s telegram 852,

                            suggesting the advisability of interning such merchant crews. The
                            opinion seemed to be that there was little hope that the suggestion
                            would be accepted but that it was worth while to make an attempt and put
                            the Spanish Government on record. If this internment spontaneous, I
                            believe it would remove the chief abuse of which the Department
                            complains in its confidential telegram 746, November 10, 7 p.m.<note

                            British Ambassador has secured such authorization. In his note to
                            Minister of State he will suggest as alternative to internment of crews
                            if that is impossible, that the Spanish Government send all German
                            vessels to one port, preferably Algeciras, where they could be carefully
                            watched and could not be used as submarine bases. Personally I do not
                            think Spanish Government will consider this latter request.</p>

                            Ambassador transmitted to Your Excellency’s predecessor, the <persName

                            note in regard to a suggestion which he had previously made concerning
                            the signals made by the German merchant ships <hi rend="italic"
                                >Belgrano</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Fangsturm</hi>. This suggestion
                            was to the effect that the only means of preventing the vessels above
                            mentioned, and other German ships in Spanish ports, from giving
                            assistance to German submarines in their operations against Allied and
                            Spanish ships was to cause their crews to be interned in the interior of
                            Spain.</p>
                        <p>I am to-day in receipt of a telegram from my Government, stating that it
                            agrees with the views expressed by the French Government through its
                            Ambassador in the above-mentioned note of October 26 last.</p>
                        <p>My Government has reasons for believing that these German interned ships
                            are used as a channel of communication with German submarines, and that
                            by means of signals they give information concerning arrivals,
                            departures, and whereabouts of Spanish and Allied ships, many of which
                            are attacked and sunk.</p>
                        <p>My Government feels that these German ships, by using Spanish ports as
                            bases of intelligence for submarine operations against vessels of
                            nations with which His Majesty’s Government is at peace, are endangering
                            the neutrality of that Government, and I am accordingly instructed to
                            express the hope that His Majesty’s Government will accept the
                            suggestion of the French Government, and intern in the interior of the
                            country the crews of German merchant ships now in Spanish ports.</p>
